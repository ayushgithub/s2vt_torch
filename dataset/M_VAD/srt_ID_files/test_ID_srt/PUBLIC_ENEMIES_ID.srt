PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS19
00:02:46,00 --> 00:03:13,50
Sitting across from them, a younger inmate glances up. The two men dig through large spools of white thread. They each pull out a gun and using the spools to conceal them, pass them to the young inmate and man sitting next to him. They stealthily tuck the weapons in their pants. From the same box, the older inmate and the sandy-haired man retrieve guns of their own. Crossing between two rows of workbenches, the sandy-haired man drops a load of shirts. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS20
00:03:12,00 --> 00:03:18,50
The guards. The younger inmate punches another guard in his chest. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS21
00:03:20,00 --> 00:03:25,50
As the older inmate punches punches another guard in the gut. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS24
00:03:38,00 --> 00:03:43,50
Another guard at a door. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS25
00:04:26,00 --> 00:04:30,50
SOMEONE leaves. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS26
00:04:30,00 --> 00:04:34,50
SOMEONE opens the steel door. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS27
00:04:33,00 --> 00:04:38,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> shuts the door behind him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS28
00:04:36,00 --> 00:04:46,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Red> leaves the metal gate behind and crosses the open ground toward the sedan. He glances back to the lookout turret. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS31
00:04:56,00 --> 00:05:13,50
He reaches for the younger inmate's gun. The younger inmate shoots him, which captures the rest of the room's attention. Outside, SOMEONE<Red> walks backward 20 yards from the gate. Inside, the criminals run out, leaving their hostages behind. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS33
00:05:42,00 --> 00:05:48,50
getaway car, another guard fires a rifle. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS34
00:05:47,00 --> 00:05:53,50
Shot in the back, SOMEONE<Walter> collapses.  

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS35
00:05:51,00 --> 00:05:55,50
Standing on the running board he sticks to his arm as they drive away. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS36
00:05:53,00 --> 00:06:11,50
His body dragging across the dirt, SOMEONE<Walter> hangs onto SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> arm, grimacing in pain. SOMEONE<Dillinger> struggles to keep his grip while holding on to the moving car himself. SOMEONE<Walter> looks up to his old friend and grins, then his hardened face goes blank. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS37
00:06:10,00 --> 00:06:21,50
His grip on SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> forearm gives way and the gang leader lets him go. SOMEONE's<Walter's> body slides to a stop in the dirt as the car drives off leaving a cloud of dust behind. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS39
00:06:21,00 --> 00:06:33,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> lingers for a moment, then climbs into the back of the moving sedan. As the sandy-haired escapee shuts the door, SOMEONE<Dillinger> puts a handgun to SOMEONE's<Shouse's> neck. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS40
00:06:40,00 --> 00:06:45,50
SOMEONE<Red> drives, sitting next to the younger escapee. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS41
00:06:47,00 --> 00:06:54,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> lowers his handgun, then punches SOMEONE<Shouse> in the face a couple of times. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS42
00:06:53,00 --> 00:06:58,50
Out of the moving vehicle. SOMEONE<Shouse> lands

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS43
00:06:57,00 --> 00:07:11,50
face down in the grass. SOMEONE<Dillinger> closes the sedan's door and sits back in his seat next to the sandy-haired SOMEONE<Pete>. Gathering himself, he sniffs, flaring his nostrils. Then stares forward with a steely gaze. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS44
00:07:17,00 --> 00:07:41,50
SOMEONE<Red> peers out the smeared windshield with a solemn expression. Now, SOMEONE<Dillinger> stands below an overcast sky. Strands of his greasy black hair hang over his forehead. His gaze drifts to a road which cuts through a desolate field toward the flat horizon. In a farmhouse, gang members change clothes while eating. A woman wraps food in newspapers and brings it over to their table. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS45
00:07:45,00 --> 00:07:50,50
SOMEONE<Pete> buttons up next to another escapee. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS46
00:07:49,00 --> 00:07:53,50
SOMEONE<Red> puts out a cigarette. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS47
00:07:57,00 --> 00:08:05,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Dillinger> walks alone. Without his overcoat, he wears a black vest and a leather gun holster. The woman stops him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS48
00:08:08,00 --> 00:08:30,50
They hold eye contact, and she lets go. As SOMEONE<Dillinger> turns and walks away from the farmhouse, the woman continues to gaze after him. A little boy in overalls comes up and takes her hand. Together, they wander a few steps without taking their eyes off of him. Now in the car as SOMEONE<Red> drives, SOMEONE<Dillinger> looks back at SOMEONE<Pete>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS49
00:08:30,00 --> 00:08:35,50
He faces forward and glances at SOMEONE<Red>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS50
00:08:35,00 --> 00:08:52,50
Now, a man in a blue suit hurries through lush green woods with a SOMEONE<Tommy> gun. He trips, then climbs to his feet and runs on. A clean-cut man wearing suspenders swiftly moves after him toting a rifle. A group of armed lawmen follow behind, charging up a hill. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS51
00:08:54,00 --> 00:08:59,50
Races downhill into an apple orchard. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS52
00:09:14,00 --> 00:09:19,50
Flyod runs backwards firing wildly. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS53
00:09:20,00 --> 00:09:25,50
The lawman's shot misses and Floyd runs off. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS54
00:09:26,00 --> 00:09:32,50
The trigger. Floyd sprints through the trees. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS55
00:09:38,00 --> 00:09:45,50
The shot blasts through Floyd's belly and he flops on the grass. The shooter gazes. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS56
00:09:48,00 --> 00:10:00,50
Floyd takes out a pistol which the lawman kicks out of his hand. He aims his rifle at the wounded outlaw who lies on his back. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS60
00:10:58,00 --> 00:11:03,50
As the other looks out the window. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS61
00:11:02,00 --> 00:11:10,50
A large man in suspenders peers through the blinds. He turns away from the window and hurries out of the room. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS62
00:11:08,00 --> 00:11:14,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Dillinger> and his men step out of their car. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS63
00:11:12,00 --> 00:11:18,50
As they approach the house, a young blonde woman greets them. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS64
00:11:20,00 --> 00:11:26,50
He grins and gives the blonde a kiss. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS65
00:11:24,00 --> 00:11:28,50
They head inside. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS66
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:37,50
Later in a garage, SOMEONE<Dillinger> sits across from a gunsmith as he disassembles a SOMEONE<Tommy> gun. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS67
00:11:35,00 --> 00:11:40,50
Trigger handle and pulls out a coil. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS68
00:11:43,00 --> 00:11:50,50
Outside a window behind the gunsmith, two cars arrive. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS69
00:11:52,00 --> 00:11:59,50
SOMEONE<Red> steps out of the safe house. SOMEONE<Dillinger> glances at the door where the blonde nods to him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS70
00:11:57,00 --> 00:12:08,50
He gets up and leaves the garage. As he crosses to the house, SOMEONE<Dillinger> tosses a set of keys to SOMEONE<Pete> who joins SOMEONE<Red> to see the new car. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS71
00:12:18,00 --> 00:12:23,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Dillinger> enters the kitchen. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS72
00:12:22,00 --> 00:12:31,50
A man leans against the refrigerator. SOMEONE<Dillinger> washes his hands. A woman smokes at the table. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS73
00:12:34,00 --> 00:12:40,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> hands him a stuffed envelope. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS74
00:12:39,00 --> 00:12:47,50
He goes around the table. He kisses her cheek. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS75
00:12:46,00 --> 00:13:05,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> leaves the kitchen. Now, three men in fedoras and overcoats ascend a wide staircase separated from each other by two center railings. Reaching the top, SOMEONE<Dillinger> stops, scanning a huge bank with angular walls lined with tellers. His two cohorts split off. SOMEONE<Pete> approaches a guard. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS76
00:13:04,00 --> 00:13:08,50
He bashes his face. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS77
00:13:17,00 --> 00:13:25,50
Parades the bank president around the counter and across the floor. They pass a trembling customer. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS78
00:13:23,00 --> 00:13:29,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> pushes the president forward to a metal gate. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS79
00:13:27,00 --> 00:13:31,50
Men collects cash from a teller. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS80
00:13:31,00 --> 00:13:37,50
Sorts keys. SOMEONE<Dillinger> smacks him in the head with his pistol and points it. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS82
00:13:50,00 --> 00:13:56,50
SOMEONE<Pete> hops up on the counter, aiming his machine gun. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS83
00:13:54,00 --> 00:14:07,50
Outside, Homer discretely holds a rifle at his side. He sees an arriving police car and backs into a recess by a set of double doors. He knocks with the butt of his rifle. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS84
00:14:10,00 --> 00:14:21,50
Inside the bank, SOMEONE<Dillinger> waits as the president fills a sack with money from the safe. In a getaway car, SOMEONE<Red> checks the time on a pocket watch, then drives. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS85
00:14:20,00 --> 00:14:25,50
And run across the street toward the bank.  

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS86
00:14:25,00 --> 00:14:31,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Dillinger> pushes the president forward. He notice. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS87
00:14:29,00 --> 00:14:35,50
And change set out on the counter, and faces the customer it belongs to. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS88
00:14:42,00 --> 00:14:47,50
As shield and fires. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS89
00:14:47,00 --> 00:14:54,50
Inside, a young female teller hurries to SOMEONE<Dillinger> and they head back down the stairs. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS90
00:14:53,00 --> 00:14:59,50
Another police car arrives down the block. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS91
00:14:57,00 --> 00:15:13,50
In his car as the robbers exit with four hostages. Down the road, lawmen aim rifles over the car's hood. SOMEONE<Dillinger> and his men, using their hostages as shields, cross to the getaway car. SOMEONE<Dillinger> aims at the police over the president's shoulder. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS92
00:15:14,00 --> 00:15:19,50
Officer fires first. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS93
00:15:31,00 --> 00:15:35,50
Coats flap in the breeze. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS94
00:15:32,00 --> 00:15:37,50
The car comes to a stop under a bridge. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS95
00:15:35,00 --> 00:15:39,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> faces Homer's hostage. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS96
00:15:42,00 --> 00:15:54,50
Two hostages run off. SOMEONE<Dillinger> notices his young hostage shivering. He wraps his overcoat around her and guides her into the backseat. SOMEONE<Red> drives off. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS97
00:15:57,00 --> 00:16:02,50
The car heads down a dirt road leading toward a forest. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS98
00:16:10,00 --> 00:16:15,50
Tie the president and the young teller to a tree. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS99
00:16:19,00 --> 00:16:24,50
The bank robbers leave their hostages and stride out of the trees. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS100
00:16:28,00 --> 00:16:32,50
They get in and drive. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS102
00:16:38,00 --> 00:16:45,50
Now in a marble hearing room, a square-jawed man faces a committee. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS104
00:17:03,00 --> 00:17:08,50
He tilts his ear toward the chairman. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS105
00:17:17,00 --> 00:17:23,50
The mustached senator looks Director Hoover in the eye. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS106
00:17:42,00 --> 00:17:47,50
Hoover whispers to a bespectacled man. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS107
00:18:11,00 --> 00:18:19,50
out with the bespectacled Suydam and a slender young man. As they walk down a hall, Suydam takes notes. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS108
00:18:29,00 --> 00:18:34,50
Hoover looks to his young associate. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS109
00:18:33,00 --> 00:18:44,50
Now, a fedora sits on a burgundy leather couch by SOMEONE<Purvis> who gazes off thoughtfully. As Hoover exits a nearby office, SOMEONE<Purvis> stands. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS110
00:18:52,00 --> 00:18:56,50
They cross an FBI bullpen. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS111
00:19:03,00 --> 00:19:11,50
The men step onto a sunny veranda where reporters gather. Hoover faces a microphone. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS112
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:39,50
Hoover motions for SOMEONE<Purvis> to take his place at the mic. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS113
00:20:25,00 --> 00:20:29,50
He checks his watch and look. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS114
00:20:28,00 --> 00:20:37,50
Rubbing the tip of his nose, he shifts his gaze to the dance floor where a brunette in a red dress dances with a man. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS115
00:20:36,00 --> 00:20:48,50
Fixed on her. His attention shifts as a scrawny guy with glasses approaches. SOMEONE<Dillinger> stands and shakes his hand. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS116
00:20:55,00 --> 00:21:02,50
The scrawny SOMEONE<Alvin> takes a seat beside SOMEONE<Dillinger> and leans close. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS120
00:22:12,00 --> 00:22:17,50
SOMEONE<Alvin> nods and heads off. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS121
00:22:26,00 --> 00:22:33,50
SOMEONE<Pete> and Homer swagger off. SOMEONE<Dillinger> leans toward SOMEONE<Red>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS122
00:22:42,00 --> 00:22:48,50
SOMEONE<Red> eyes the brunette in the red dress as she returns to her table. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS123
00:22:50,00 --> 00:22:55,50
SOMEONE<Anna> leads a young woman to SOMEONE<Red>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS124
00:23:00,00 --> 00:23:23,50
SOMEONE<Anna> follows SOMEONE<Red> and Veronica as they stroll away, leaving SOMEONE<Dillinger> alone. He stares at the brunette in the red dress who laughs and beams. The gang leader sips his drink and stands, keeping his eyes locked on the exotic woman. He strides resolutely through the crowd and halts just behind her, and leans onto her chair. She looks up at him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS125
00:23:24,00 --> 00:23:29,50
He gives his head a stunned shake. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS126
00:23:32,00 --> 00:23:37,50
Her bright red lips smile coyly. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS127
00:23:37,00 --> 00:23:44,50
She grins at the other women seated at her table, then SOMEONE<sashays> off with SOMEONE<Dillinger>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS128
00:23:42,00 --> 00:23:48,50
He warily locks eyes with her, then looks away. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS129
00:23:56,00 --> 00:24:00,50
Leads the way to the dance floor. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS130
00:24:10,00 --> 00:24:18,50
He takes her hand and she places her other hand on his shoulder. They sway together. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS131
00:24:20,00 --> 00:24:24,50
SOMEONE<Billie> smiles. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS132
00:24:27,00 --> 00:24:33,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> gazes off shyly, then finds her lovely face. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS133
00:24:35,00 --> 00:24:40,50
SOMEONE<Billie> stares back defiantly. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS134
00:24:52,00 --> 00:25:00,50
Her dark eyes probe his as they sway with the music. She allows a faint smile. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS135
00:24:59,00 --> 00:25:06,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> summons up a breath and arches his brows. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS136
00:25:11,00 --> 00:25:16,50
Her smile broadens. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS139
00:25:28,00 --> 00:25:34,50
Later, SOMEONE<Billie> and SOMEONE<Dillinger> stride through the club's foyer. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS141
00:25:40,00 --> 00:25:45,50
A gust of wind, SOMEONE turns her to face him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS142
00:25:44,00 --> 00:25:48,50
Her coat over her shoulders. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS143
00:25:47,00 --> 00:25:54,50
And continues down the sidewalk with his jacket and arm around her. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS144
00:25:52,00 --> 00:26:06,50
Later in an elegant restaurant, SOMEONE<Billie> uneasily scans her surroundings, then looks to SOMEONE<Dillinger>. She smiles, the glances at a female diner. The snobbish woman gives her the eye. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS145
00:26:12,00 --> 00:26:18,50
SOMEONE's<Billie's> smile briefly falters. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS146
00:26:40,00 --> 00:26:46,50
He flashes an amused smile and sits back. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS147
00:27:06,00 --> 00:27:11,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> breaks off, eyeing another table. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS148
00:27:24,00 --> 00:27:30,50
SOMEONE<Billie> and SOMEONE<Dillinger> lock gazes. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS149
00:27:29,00 --> 00:27:36,50
A faint smile curls the corners of her lips. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS150
00:27:34,00 --> 00:27:48,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> stands and holds her chair as she gets up, then guides her through the restaurant with a hand at her back. Now, they face a coat check counter. At a bar, a stocky man with slick back hair notices them. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS151
00:27:47,00 --> 00:27:54,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> glances at the man over his shoulder, then leans toward SOMEONE<Billie>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS152
00:27:53,00 --> 00:28:02,50
He steps away. SOMEONE<Billie> irritably shifts her gaze, then glares at him and yanks on her coat. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS153
00:28:01,00 --> 00:28:05,50
She storms out. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS154
00:28:03,00 --> 00:28:08,50
The two men shake hands. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS155
00:28:15,00 --> 00:28:30,50
SOMEONE<Nitti>, a lean man with dark, sleek hair and a handlebar mustache slouches as he eats. A short husky man with SOMEONE<olive> skin and a toothbrush mustache approaches SOMEONE<Dillinger>. They shake hands. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS158
00:28:42,00 --> 00:28:53,50
SOMEONE<D'Andrea> leaves. SOMEONE<Dillinger> swaps looks with Gilbert, then shoves through a revolving door. Outside, he finds only a wealthy young couple. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS159
00:28:52,00 --> 00:28:57,50
The gang leader glances around the sidewalk. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS161
00:29:06,00 --> 00:29:10,50
On SOMEONE'<Purvis'> Pierce-Arrow. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS162
00:29:24,00 --> 00:29:29,50
FBI field office, a chubby agent shows a jacket. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS163
00:29:42,00 --> 00:29:48,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> paces, then addresses his assembled task force. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS164
00:30:17,00 --> 00:30:21,50
He faces a secretary. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS165
00:30:38,00 --> 00:30:45,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> gazes out a window at a neighboring high-rise, then faces his men. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS166
00:30:50,00 --> 00:30:55,50
One agent briefly drops his gaze. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS167
00:30:55,00 --> 00:31:00,50
Now at a telephone exchange with SOMEONE<Baum>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS168
00:31:04,00 --> 00:31:10,50
He plays a 78 record. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS169
00:31:33,00 --> 00:31:41,50
Nighttime, SOMEONE<Dillinger> strides past a bright city park. Later, he marches through a crowd 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS170
00:31:46,00 --> 00:31:52,50
She notices SOMEONE<Dillinger> as a male guest holds out his coat to her. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS172
00:32:20,00 --> 00:32:32,50
Yanking the man's wrist over the counter, SOMEONE<Dillinger> snatches his claim ticket. SOMEONE<Billie> stares as he finds the man's coat. The exotic beauty drops her gaze and SOMEONE<Dillinger> throws the coat at its owner. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS173
00:32:32,00 --> 00:32:36,50
He gets SOMEONE's<Billie's> coat. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS174
00:32:58,00 --> 00:33:05,50
He holds her coat open. SOMEONE<Billie> eyes it, then looks to a staring co-worker. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS175
00:33:05,00 --> 00:33:25,50
With a coy smirk, she steps out from behind the counter and slips into her coat. Now in an apartment, a hand drops a rabbit's foot key chain by a tabletop sculpture of two racing greyhounds. SOMEONE<Dillinger> leads SOMEONE<Billie> down a hall into a luxurious living room. As she takes in the space, he sets a chair near a sofa and looks to her. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS176
00:33:23,00 --> 00:33:29,50
SOMEONE<Billie> joins him, slipping off her coat. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS177
00:33:28,00 --> 00:33:34,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> sets a simple cardboard box on the coffee table. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS178
00:33:35,00 --> 00:33:41,50
SOMEONE<Billie> complies and looks around with a faint smile. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS179
00:33:43,00 --> 00:34:01,50
Behind her, SOMEONE<Red> appears in his undershirt and leans through an open-air interior window. He gets a couple of glasses from a counter, then saunters off with two women. SOMEONE<Dillinger> sits facing SOMEONE<Billie> and lays his hand on the large box. The exotic beauty eyes it coolly. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS180
00:34:01,00 --> 00:34:24,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> allows a subdued smile then shifts boyishly in his seat. SOMEONE<Billie> removes the lid, finding forest green tissue paper over the contents. Folding back the layer, she finds a camel hair coat with a thick fur collar. SOMEONE<Billie> lifts the present from its box, staring at it. She swallows, then raises her tender gaze to meet SOMEONE's<Dillinger's>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS181
00:34:30,00 --> 00:34:40,50
Her full lips curl into a smile and the crime boss grins. They gaze into each other's eyes. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS182
00:34:38,00 --> 00:34:43,50
Later on a bed, they smother each other with kisses. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS184
00:34:53,00 --> 00:35:06,50
Her head, revealing a silvery blue slip, then leans over on top of SOMEONE<Dillinger>. Glimpses of SOMEONE<Dillinger> thrusting into SOMEONE<Billie> from behind interspersed with their nuzzling face-to-face. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS185
00:35:26,00 --> 00:35:32,50
A recent flashback shows them writhing ecstatically. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS186
00:35:40,00 --> 00:36:03,50
Another flash shows SOMEONE<Dillinger> kiss her mouth. His face withdraws down her chest. Later as they cuddle, they share a warm smile. Later still, SOMEONE<Billie> strolls in her slip to a window seat. Open suitcases occupy every inch, filled to the brim with neatly packed clothes. SOMEONE<Billie> caresses their contents, then rejoins SOMEONE<Dillinger> in bed. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS187
00:36:04,00 --> 00:36:12,50
She lays her head on his shoulder. Rolling over to face her, he strokes her cheek and neck. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS188
00:36:13,00 --> 00:36:18,50
His thumb gently rubs her graceful jawline. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS189
00:36:18,00 --> 00:36:24,50
His gaze pours over her face and he grins. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS190
00:36:26,00 --> 00:36:33,50
SOMEONE<Billie> gazes dreamily at him and he gives her another smile. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS191
00:36:33,00 --> 00:36:39,50
His thumb caresses her cheek in a gently rhythm. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS192
00:36:38,00 --> 00:36:43,50
He flashes a puckish grin. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS194
00:36:46,00 --> 00:36:51,50
To his ear and a handheld mic at his lips. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS195
00:37:03,00 --> 00:37:13,50
Later, the Pierce-Arrow pulls up to a curb. SOMEONE<Purvis> drives with SOMEONE<Baum> at his side. Two other G-Men approach the luxury car. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS196
00:37:18,00 --> 00:37:24,50
One of the street agents looks to his young partner who bows his head. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS197
00:37:30,00 --> 00:37:35,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> faces SOMEONE<Baum>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS198
00:37:38,00 --> 00:37:44,50
He points, then gets out and faces the young G-Man. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS199
00:37:43,00 --> 00:38:05,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> leads him across the street to a tawny white apartment building. Inside, they enter a long, dim hallway. SOMEONE<Purvis> leads Agent Barton to a door, then readies his hand on his gun. We watch the agents from afar as they prepare, the lengthy corridor dwarfing their trench-coated forms. SOMEONE<Purvis> lifts his knuckles to the door. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS200
00:38:06,00 --> 00:38:16,50
It opens, revealing a young woman in a demure house dress, her strawberry blonde hair frames her face in a curly SOMEONE<bob>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS201
00:38:28,00 --> 00:38:33,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> steps toward the doorway. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS202
00:38:34,00 --> 00:38:42,50
As he enters, Barton lingers in the hall. At a table, a stout man eats. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS203
00:38:42,00 --> 00:38:47,50
The baby-faced man nods. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS204
00:38:49,00 --> 00:38:54,50
She steps away. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS205
00:39:08,00 --> 00:39:14,50
Returning, the woman shows off her shoes. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS206
00:39:12,00 --> 00:39:19,50
She holds out the open wallet as well. SOMEONE<Purvis> eyes it and gives a nod. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS207
00:39:22,00 --> 00:39:33,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> leaves, shutting the door. The woman looks wearily to the stout gentleman at the dining table. Now, SOMEONE<Purvis> and Barton enter a stairwell. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS208
00:39:36,00 --> 00:39:44,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> hurries downstairs. Rushing from the building, he runs across the street to Agent SOMEONE<Baum>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS209
00:39:44,00 --> 00:39:50,50
In the stairwell, Barton peers through a window in the door. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS210
00:39:50,00 --> 00:39:57,50
Squinting, he steps into the hallway and lets the door swing shut behind him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS211
00:39:56,00 --> 00:40:04,50
From the stairwell, our gaze lingers on the door, then drifts over to a set of elevators. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS212
00:40:03,00 --> 00:40:08,50
Opens, revealing a tall man with rugged features. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS213
00:40:06,00 --> 00:40:12,50
He steps off and heads for the door. In the hallway, 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS214
00:40:11,00 --> 00:40:16,50
Barton sees the rugged man behind him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS216
00:40:17,00 --> 00:40:21,50
The stranger stops. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS217
00:40:20,00 --> 00:40:27,50
Behind Barton, a stout, baby-faced man steps into the hall and shoots him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS218
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:35,50
G-Man lurches and falls. In the street, SOMEONE<Purvis> turns. The shooter and his rugged associate leave. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS219
00:40:34,00 --> 00:40:47,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> races toward the building. SOMEONE<Baum> whips out his gun and peers at a car parked in the alley. Inside, SOMEONE<Purvis> enters the hallway and raises his gun. He advances cautiously. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS220
00:40:46,00 --> 00:40:51,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> stops, looking down. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS221
00:40:50,00 --> 00:41:17,50
Glancing warily ahead, he crouches. SOMEONE'<Purvis'> mouth drops open as he stares downward. On the floor, a blood pool spreads beneath Barton. As the wounded man twitches feebly, SOMEONE<Purvis> watches with a clenched jaw. His expression grows solemn and he glares down the hall. He rises, leaving a lifeless Barton. Outside, SOMEONE<Baum> sees two men hurrying down the alley steps. The baby-faced shooter raises a SOMEONE<Tommy> gun. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS222
00:41:19,00 --> 00:41:24,50
pulling out. He takes cover behind a garden plant. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS223
00:41:22,00 --> 00:41:27,50
As the two criminals get into the parked car. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS224
00:41:32,00 --> 00:41:37,50
a panic Maulin leans out an open window. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS225
00:41:39,00 --> 00:41:46,50
Outside, two agents pull their car up as their superior exits the building. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS226
00:41:47,00 --> 00:41:52,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> stops, staring with his mouth agape. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS227
00:41:52,00 --> 00:41:58,50
They agent shifts his rueful gaze. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS228
00:41:56,00 --> 00:42:03,50
With a slow, deliberate stride, SOMEONE<Purvis> steps closer to his man. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS229
00:42:06,00 --> 00:42:14,50
His frustrated gaze scans the agents, his breath puffing visibly in the night air. He steps away. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS230
00:42:12,00 --> 00:42:34,50
Daytime, a bank's door is open and three men in long coats enter. Our gaze drifts up to find SOMEONE<Pete> between SOMEONE<Dillinger> and a heavyset thug. The two leaner men split off together. SOMEONE<Pete> encounters a guard, sucker punches him, and bangs his head against the counter. Without breaking his stride, SOMEONE<Dillinger> draws a gun in each hand. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS232
00:42:47,00 --> 00:42:51,50
The bankers all obey. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS233
00:42:50,00 --> 00:42:55,50
SOMEONE<Pete> shifts his aim. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS234
00:42:53,00 --> 00:42:58,50
A banker leads SOMEONE<Dillinger> to a vault. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS235
00:42:57,00 --> 00:43:01,50
As Hoover talks on the phone. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS236
00:43:47,00 --> 00:43:53,50
Hoover shifts his resentful gaze and works his jaw. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS237
00:43:54,00 --> 00:44:01,50
In Chicago, SOMEONE<Purvis> grimly lowers the phone and shifts his troubled gaze. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS239
00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:24,50
Features disembarks flanked by two associates. He peers down the platform 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS240
00:44:28,00 --> 00:44:35,50
The three newcomers make their way down the platform, suitcases in hand. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS241
00:44:35,00 --> 00:44:42,50
Now, travelers mill about on a vast terminal's marble floors. The three arriving. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS242
00:44:40,00 --> 00:44:47,50
pause taking in their surroundings. Now, at a shoeshine stand. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS243
00:44:48,00 --> 00:44:54,50
Older newcomer takes a seat, SOMEONE<Purvis> approaches. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS244
00:45:27,00 --> 00:45:33,50
SOMEONE<Nitti> summons a breath, squinting in the sunlight. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS245
00:45:36,00 --> 00:45:41,50
SOMEONE<D'Andrea> waves at SOMEONE<Dillinger> across the corral. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS246
00:45:42,00 --> 00:45:53,50
SOMEONE<D'Andrea> glances around. Later, SOMEONE<Dillinger> plops into a chair in the grandstand. SOMEONE<Billie> sits beside him. One row down, SOMEONE<Pete> leans closer. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS249
00:46:10,00 --> 00:46:15,50
glares at him, then drops her gaze. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS250
00:46:17,00 --> 00:46:21,50
SOMEONE<D'Andrea> joins him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS251
00:46:25,00 --> 00:46:31,50
SOMEONE<D'Andrea> leaves. SOMEONE<Billie> stares off. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS252
00:47:02,00 --> 00:47:10,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> frowns, shifts in his seat, and squarely faces SOMEONE<Billie>. She hangs her head. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS253
00:47:39,00 --> 00:47:50,50
SOMEONE<Billie> allows a thoughtful smile. Leaning forward, she cups the back of SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> head in her hand and presses her lips to his. He pulls away. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS255
00:48:01,00 --> 00:48:16,50
Bush grows by a burrowed cactus and a healthy saguaro. Across the street, a sign on a large brick building reads Hotel Congress. SOMEONE<Billie> and SOMEONE<Dillinger> enter the lobby and stroll toward the front desk. A balding clerk faces them. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS256
00:48:20,00 --> 00:48:27,50
The clerk hands SOMEONE<Dillinger> a pen, and the gang leader signs a guest register. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS257
00:48:38,00 --> 00:48:44,50
SOMEONE<Billie> notices a True Detective magazine in a rack. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS258
00:48:44,00 --> 00:49:19,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> picks up a suitcase and heads off with SOMEONE<Billie>. Now, in a hotel room, he opens the suitcase, takes out his SOMEONE<Tommy> gun, and cocks it. Later, he opens a window and pulls the sheer curtains closed. The gang leader takes off his suit coat and handgun, then ambles to a set of closed double doors. Pushing one open, he peeks into a bathroom. SOMEONE<Billie> sits nude in the tub. As he opens the door all the way, she seductively slides her hands up the porcelain, out of the water, then lifts one shapely leg and caresses the tub's rim with her foot. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS259
00:49:25,00 --> 00:49:31,50
She runs her toes along a soap dish. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS260
00:49:30,00 --> 00:49:39,50
As Johnny turns back to the bedroom, the door bursts open. The balding man from the front desk leads other men in and clouts SOMEONE<Dillinger>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS261
00:49:43,00 --> 00:49:49,50
Handcuffs and SOMEONE<Billie> runs out wearing a towel. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS263
00:50:07,00 --> 00:50:18,50
The door showing an isolated cell block. Inside, the officers lock SOMEONE<Dillinger> inside a holding cell and remove his handcuffs through the bars. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS264
00:50:19,00 --> 00:50:37,50
Wearing cowboy hats, the officer's head out. SOMEONE<Dillinger> massages his wrists, gazing off. He paces forward and leans tensely on a rail attaching the cell bars one to the next. Now, the balding undercover officer knocks on the cell block door. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS265
00:50:36,00 --> 00:50:42,50
In his cell, SOMEONE<Dillinger> flips through a magazine. He looks up. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS266
00:50:42,00 --> 00:50:53,50
The balding officer leads SOMEONE<Purvis> into the cell block. Other lawmen observe from a side table. Wearing a crisp suit. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS267
00:50:51,00 --> 00:50:57,50
SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> cell and the gang leader sets down his magazine. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS268
00:50:55,00 --> 00:51:01,50
He stands and ambles toward the bars. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS269
00:51:05,00 --> 00:51:13,50
The two men size each other up. SOMEONE<Dillinger> curiously cocks his head and SOMEONE<Purvis> stares at him calmly. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS270
00:51:15,00 --> 00:51:21,50
The other officers and agents watch closely. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS271
00:51:21,00 --> 00:51:27,50
SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> eyes flit up and down the stoic G-Man. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS272
00:51:31,00 --> 00:51:36,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> shakes his head, his brow knit. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS273
00:51:56,00 --> 00:52:04,50
Blinking thoughtfully, SOMEONE<Purvis> allows a faint smile. SOMEONE<Dillinger> straightens to his full height. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS274
00:52:17,00 --> 00:52:23,50
Chewing some gum, the criminal gives a cocky smile. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS275
00:52:30,00 --> 00:52:36,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> pauses on his way out and faces SOMEONE<Dillinger>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS276
00:52:34,00 --> 00:52:41,50
Sunlight outlines SOMEONE'<Purvis'> clean-shaven face. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS277
00:52:47,00 --> 00:52:53,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> follows SOMEONE<Purvis> from inside his cell. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS278
00:52:52,00 --> 00:53:05,50
Both men walk with their hands in their pockets. His back to SOMEONE<Dillinger>, SOMEONE<Purvis> barely slows his leisurely stride and leaves with his agents. The balding officer stays behind. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS279
00:53:25,00 --> 00:53:29,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> chews his gum. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS280
00:53:28,00 --> 00:53:34,50
Nighttime, a three-propeller plane cruises through the sky, 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS283
00:53:57,00 --> 00:54:05,50
Journalists crank movie cameras. A black-and-white view through one shows a police officer. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS284
00:54:03,00 --> 00:54:12,50
SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> plane moves closer. Other journalists wait with flashbulb cameras and three lawmen hold rifles. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS286
00:54:19,00 --> 00:54:24,50
Another flare goes up. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS287
00:54:27,00 --> 00:54:34,50
Wind whips at two trench-coated lawmen. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS293
00:55:14,00 --> 00:55:18,50
On motorbikes accompany. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS294
00:55:16,00 --> 00:55:22,50
Inside the prisoner's car, SOMEONE<Dillinger> slouches, his head bobbing. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS295
00:55:25,00 --> 00:55:34,50
Seated between two of his captors, SOMEONE<Dillinger> keeps his pensive gaze aimed downward. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS296
00:55:33,00 --> 00:55:37,50
along a dim street. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS297
00:55:36,00 --> 00:55:43,50
SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> car, the criminal stares off glumly, then smiles out the window. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS300
00:56:13,00 --> 00:56:19,50
Woman paces in an office. She strides out to the crowd. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS301
00:56:18,00 --> 00:56:27,50
As arriving lawmen lead SOMEONE<Dillinger> inside, cameras flash. The robber skeptically furrows his brow. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS302
00:56:49,00 --> 00:56:56,50
A chubby lawyer puts an arm around SOMEONE<Dillinger> who rests an elbow on the man's shoulder. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS303
00:56:57,00 --> 00:57:02,50
The female sheriff glowers. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS304
00:57:13,00 --> 00:57:17,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> shrugs his brows. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS306
00:57:47,00 --> 00:58:02,50
The lawyer nonchalantly follows a second guard farther ahead. Now, a hulking black inmate strides past a row of cells and enters a common room where SOMEONE<Dillinger> reads a newspaper. The hulking man leans to SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> ear. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS307
00:58:03,00 --> 00:58:12,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> scowls toward his cell, then heads over. The hulking inmate positions himself just outside. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS308
00:58:10,00 --> 00:58:22,50
He waves two prisoners on. Now, SOMEONE<Dillinger> faces the bars in the back of his cell. The lawyer, SOMEONE<Piquett>, sits in a corridor on the other side. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS311
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:44,50
sits back and heaves a misty sigh in the cold air. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS312
00:58:44,00 --> 00:58:50,50
Now in a courtroom, SOMEONE<Piquett> sits at a council bench. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS313
00:58:49,00 --> 00:58:54,50
A deputy escorts SOMEONE<Dillinger> in in shackles. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS314
00:59:58,00 --> 01:00:03,50
The judge folds his hands thoughtfully. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS315
01:00:40,00 --> 01:00:45,50
SOMEONE<Bob> turns away with a humorless look. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS316
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:51,50
As the crowd rises, SOMEONE<Dillinger> winks at SOMEONE<Piquett>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS317
01:00:51,00 --> 01:01:18,50
The lawyer steps away. As the deputy approaches, SOMEONE<Dillinger> lowers his gaze. Later outside the jail, a cluster of National Guards stand watch by a waist-high wall of sandbags. Inside, the prisoner's mill about the common room. As a few deputies and guards work in a front office, a janitor enters. Later, he hangs up his coat. A guard unlocks a barred door, then raises his baton to a second metal door just inside. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS318
01:01:17,00 --> 01:01:27,50
The guard looks through a peephole then unlocks the door for the janitor. Carrying a mop and bucket, he crosses a hallway and waits for another guard to open the door. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS319
01:01:25,00 --> 01:01:32,50
another barred door. In the common room, SOMEONE<Dillinger> tilts his head and clenches his jaw. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS320
01:01:31,00 --> 01:01:39,50
The janitor enters and the guard shuts the door behind him. SOMEONE<Dillinger> coolly glances over his shoulder. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS321
01:01:40,00 --> 01:01:46,50
The janitor sets down his supplies and heads over. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS324
01:01:59,00 --> 01:02:05,50
SOMEONE<Cahoon> peeks through the bars. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS327
01:02:20,00 --> 01:02:25,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> pokes Bryant with the gun. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS328
01:02:26,00 --> 01:02:31,50
Still restraints SOMEONE<Cahoon>. SOMEONE<Dillinger> eyes the door. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS330
01:02:45,00 --> 01:02:59,50
The metal door. The guard on the other side peeks through then unlocks it. As he opens the door, SOMEONE<Dillinger> shoves him into Max and his accomplice hits Bryant with his pipe. SOMEONE rushes into the office and holds his gun. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS332
01:03:14,00 --> 01:03:31,50
As SOMEONE<Dillinger> jams the barrel of his gun into the warden's neck, the warden spins the dial on a safe door. SOMEONE<Dillinger> steps into the closet-sized safe, discards his fake, waxy gun, and grabs a pistol from the wall. He steps out with a rifle and hands a machine gun. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS333
01:03:34,00 --> 01:03:42,50
The warden glances back as the accomplice leads him away. SOMEONE<Dillinger> grabs a hat and coat from a nearby rack. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS334
01:03:41,00 --> 01:04:03,50
He puts them on and tosses a jacket to the other inmate who grabs a hat from the rack as he ushers the deputy out behind SOMEONE<Dillinger>. With his rifle raised, SOMEONE<Dillinger> cautiously opens a metal door in the hallway. His accomplice follows close behind with one hand clutching the deputy between them. They make their way into a garage where a mechanic works on a police car. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS336
01:04:18,00 --> 01:04:41,50
He strides to the Ford V8. Outside, four officers talk to each other on a porch, their guns perched casually against their shoulders. The sleek Ford passes undetected in the alley beside them. At the front of the jailhouse, the National Guardsmen mill about by their sandbag wall. They pay no attention as the Ford trundles by and turns on to the main street. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS337
01:04:41,00 --> 01:04:55,50
As SOMEONE<Dillinger> drives through the town, he nervously shifts his eyes back and forth under the tipped down brim of his fedora. The jailhouse mechanic sits beside him while his accomplice rides in back with the deputy. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS338
01:04:53,00 --> 01:05:11,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> notices three National Guardsmen strolling down the sidewalk. He stops for a red traffic light on a corner where more National Guardsmen stand together talking, their guns strapped over their shoulders. They glance curiously at the car, then resume their conversation. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS340
01:05:14,00 --> 01:05:18,50
Licks his lips, his head bowed slightly. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS341
01:05:17,00 --> 01:05:22,50
Inches his left hand toward the gun nestled in his waistband. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS342
01:05:31,00 --> 01:05:36,50
to green and SOMEONE<Dillinger> puts the car in gear. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS343
01:05:35,00 --> 01:05:39,50
On to another street. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS344
01:06:00,00 --> 01:06:05,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> looks at the mechanic. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS345
01:06:03,00 --> 01:06:08,50
He shakes his head lightheartedly. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS346
01:06:10,00 --> 01:06:16,50
Befuddled mechanic shakes his head. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS348
01:06:27,00 --> 01:06:32,50
Youngblood grins. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS349
01:06:39,00 --> 01:06:46,50
Elsewhere, Hoover listens on the radio and pinches the bridge of his nose. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS351
01:06:52,00 --> 01:06:59,50
Now at her apartment, SOMEONE<Billie> sits in a chair, her hands fidgeting anxiously. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS352
01:06:58,00 --> 01:07:05,50
On and leans against a wall as she holds the receiver to her ear. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS353
01:07:29,00 --> 01:07:35,50
At the telephone exchange, SOMEONE<Baum> listens. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS354
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:46,50
SOMEONE<Billie> clutches the phone despondently. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS355
01:07:45,00 --> 01:07:51,50
She lowers her sad, resigned eyes. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS356
01:07:52,00 --> 01:07:58,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> stands inside a phone booth with a faint, tender smile. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS357
01:07:56,00 --> 01:08:19,50
SOMEONE<Billie> removes the receiver from her ear and clutches it against the base of her neck, resting her chin on her knuckles. Outside her apartment, two men watch from inside a car concealed underneath a bridge. Later, SOMEONE<Purvis> sits in a car outside the apartment. SOMEONE<Baum> climbs into the passenger seat and hands him a file with the transcript from SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> phone call to SOMEONE<Billie>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS358
01:08:27,00 --> 01:08:46,50
Behind them, an L train glides across a bridge, its interior lights glowing in the darkness. Daytime. A tan car pulls to a stop, and SOMEONE<Dillinger> and SOMEONE<Red> climb out. As SOMEONE<Dillinger> heads around the corner down an icy walkway, SOMEONE<Sport> steps out of the safe house. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS359
01:08:50,00 --> 01:08:58,50
SOMEONE<Red> perches on the side of the car, his gun raised. SOMEONE<Marty> emerges from the house behind SOMEONE<Sport>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS360
01:08:57,00 --> 01:09:03,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> narrows his eyes and tilts his head. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS361
01:09:06,00 --> 01:09:11,50
He pulls out his machine gun. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS364
01:09:40,00 --> 01:09:47,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> gives Gilbert a hard look. Gilbert leads SOMEONE<Dillinger> and SOMEONE<Red> upstairs. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS365
01:09:46,00 --> 01:10:04,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> takes in the chalkboard-covered walls and the rows of men at desks chattering on telephones. Small overhead lights with green lampshades hang from above next to dangling clusters of phone wires. SOMEONE<D'Andrea> sits on the corner of a desk. He looks at Gilbert. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS367
01:10:13,00 --> 01:10:19,50
Grabs him in a choke hold and aims a gun at Gilbert. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS368
01:10:18,00 --> 01:10:22,50
He cocks his head. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS369
01:10:20,00 --> 01:10:26,50
SOMEONE<D'Andrea> looks at Gilbert whose hand rest on his gun. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS370
01:10:25,00 --> 01:10:30,50
He turns to SOMEONE<Dillinger> and SOMEONE<Red>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS371
01:10:28,00 --> 01:10:34,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> tosses the blonde man away. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS372
01:10:32,00 --> 01:10:38,50
SOMEONE<D'Andrea> sits calmly on the edge of a desk. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS373
01:10:38,00 --> 01:10:42,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> holsters his gun. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS374
01:11:15,00 --> 01:11:21,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> knits his brow thoughtfully, then meets SOMEONE's<D'Andrea's> gaze. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS375
01:11:24,00 --> 01:11:29,50
SOMEONE<D'Andrea> shrugs. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS376
01:11:56,00 --> 01:12:06,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> glares at SOMEONE<D'Andrea>, his lips curved into a frown. The mustached gangster leans in closer. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS377
01:12:05,00 --> 01:12:14,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> tilts his head, his eyes narrowing as he meets SOMEONE's<D'Andrea's> gaze. He turns away. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS378
01:12:12,00 --> 01:12:19,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> and SOMEONE<Red> exit. Now, Hoover and SOMEONE<Purvis> walk down a hall. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS379
01:12:54,00 --> 01:13:03,50
Outside, Hoover turns from SOMEONE<Purvis> and heads over to a group of well-dressed boys standing in two lines. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS380
01:13:04,00 --> 01:13:10,50
They shake hands. Hoover faces the press. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS383
01:13:55,00 --> 01:14:00,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> nods his head at SOMEONE<Shouse>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS384
01:14:12,00 --> 01:14:19,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> appears on screen. SOMEONE<Dillinger> subtly covers his face. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS385
01:14:19,00 --> 01:14:24,50
Stands and SOMEONE<Red> yanks him back into his seat. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS386
01:14:22,00 --> 01:14:34,50
Homer looks away nervously as SOMEONE<Dillinger> sits with a worried look, his face tilted down. The overhead light turns on, bathing the audience members' faces 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS387
01:14:33,00 --> 01:14:39,50
The audience turns, peering at the people to the right. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS388
01:14:38,00 --> 01:14:43,50
The audience turns again. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS389
01:14:44,00 --> 01:14:59,50
As the audience members settle their eyes back toward the front, the lights fade down and a new story begins. A lion's head appears onscreen with the title Ethiopia across its eyes. SOMEONE<Tommy> turns to SOMEONE<Dillinger>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS390
01:15:02,00 --> 01:15:09,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> rubs his lips thoughtfully as he looks at SOMEONE<Tommy> and nods. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS391
01:15:08,00 --> 01:15:23,50
He exchanges a glance with SOMEONE<Red> and they rise, grabbing their coats. A few rows ahead, Homer puts on his hat and steps into the aisle behind them. As they exit the theater, SOMEONE<Red> moves closer to SOMEONE<Dillinger>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS392
01:15:32,00 --> 01:15:44,50
Now, people mill around a town square. A stiff wind flutters the awnings of a storefront. On the far side of the square, a policeman pulls up on a motorcycle. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS393
01:15:52,00 --> 01:16:01,50
Outside, Homer grabs a man and holds him hostage. Inside, SOMEONE<Dillinger> and SOMEONE<Tommy> exchange an exasperated look. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS394
01:16:02,00 --> 01:16:08,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> tosses a bag to SOMEONE<Tommy>. He guides the bank president. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS395
01:16:09,00 --> 01:16:14,50
A woman joins the bank president. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS396
01:16:14,00 --> 01:16:24,50
Gangster shield themselves with the hostages as they exit the bank. They pass Homer who waits outside by their car with his own hostage. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS397
01:16:32,00 --> 01:16:36,50
He aims a gun. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS398
01:16:35,00 --> 01:16:40,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> lurches forward, his eyes wide. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS399
01:16:41,00 --> 01:16:45,50
Notices SOMEONE<Tommy> who lies on his stomach. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS400
01:17:30,00 --> 01:17:55,50
With its doors still open, the car pulls out of the town square leaving the hostages lying helplessly in the street. Now, the car speeds down an empty road lined with tall evergreens that just into the pale blue sky. Golden sunlight shines on its sleek exterior, reflecting the snow-covered ground bordering the woods. SOMEONE<Dillinger> sits in the backseat, the wind from the open windows blowing against his disheveled hair. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS401
01:17:59,00 --> 01:18:11,50
In the front passenger seat, Homer stares distantly. Behind him, SOMEONE<Dillinger> drinks from a flask as SOMEONE<Red> administers an injection into his shoulder wound. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS403
01:18:30,00 --> 01:18:38,50
Warmly through the windows. As Baby Face pulls the car to a halt, SOMEONE<Dillinger> addresses him with a frown. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS404
01:18:43,00 --> 01:18:49,50
The four gangsters the lodge. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS405
01:18:51,00 --> 01:18:56,50
Upstairs, Baby Face bundles cash. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS408
01:19:02,00 --> 01:19:07,50
He preps a dressing. Homer looks on. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS409
01:19:08,00 --> 01:19:14,50
SOMEONE<Red> unrolls a bandage and dresses SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> wound. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS410
01:19:16,00 --> 01:19:28,50
Homer grabs his take. Baby Face picks up two cash bundles and tosses one to SOMEONE<Shouse>. As they both clear out of the room, Homer hangs by in the doorway. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS411
01:19:26,00 --> 01:19:30,50
He looks to SOMEONE<Dillinger>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS412
01:19:29,00 --> 01:19:37,50
The leader gives a nod and Homer leaves. SOMEONE<Red> remains seated at SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> side. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS413
01:19:49,00 --> 01:19:55,50
As SOMEONE<Red> wipes his hands, SOMEONE<Dillinger> springs restlessly to his feet. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS414
01:20:01,00 --> 01:20:06,50
The two men share a solemn look. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS415
01:20:07,00 --> 01:20:11,50
He holds out SOMEONE's<Red's> share. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS416
01:20:18,00 --> 01:20:27,50
SOMEONE<Red> accepts the cash, gives his brow a resigned lift, and shoots a tentative smile at SOMEONE<Dillinger>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS417
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:34,50
He stows the cash in his bag and leaves. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS418
01:20:32,00 --> 01:20:39,50
Now in a medical exam room, the gangster with the eye wound pleads with two G-Men. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS420
01:20:59,00 --> 01:21:05,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> courteously gestures for the doctor to step away. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS422
01:21:10,00 --> 01:21:16,50
Back to the torture session. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS424
01:21:21,00 --> 01:21:26,50
The gangster spits at his tormentor. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS425
01:21:26,00 --> 01:21:36,50
The stern-faced G-Man turns gravely toward SOMEONE<Purvis> and nods. SOMEONE'<Purvis'> beady eyes peer downward, deep in thought. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS426
01:21:35,00 --> 01:21:40,50
Later, SOMEONE<Purvis> uses a candlestick phone. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS429
01:22:00,00 --> 01:22:07,50
It's SOMEONE<Dillinger>. He lies down on a modest twin bed. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS430
01:22:11,00 --> 01:22:21,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> picks up his pocket watch off the nightstand, opens it, and admires a photo of SOMEONE<Billie> on the inside of the cover. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS431
01:22:22,00 --> 01:22:30,50
SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> profile grows blurry as the view focuses on the radio beyond. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS432
01:22:33,00 --> 01:22:41,50
Now in a forest road, two motorcars douse their headlights as they creep forward and park on the dirt shoulder. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS433
01:22:44,00 --> 01:22:57,50
SOMEONE<Purvis>, SOMEONE<Winstead>, and several others in trench coats climb out of the vehicles. SOMEONE<Purvis> closes his door most of the way, but leaves it cracked open. The men advance. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS434
01:22:56,00 --> 01:23:09,50
Armed with their rifles and sub machine guns, the G-Men cross the shadowy woods. SOMEONE<Purvis> and SOMEONE<Winstead> stand shoulder-to-shoulder as they spot the lodge a few hundred yards off. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS435
01:23:50,00 --> 01:23:55,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> looks SOMEONE<Winstead> in the eye. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS436
01:24:04,00 --> 01:24:13,50
The partnered G-Men filter outward through the trees toward the lodge. Now, inside a warmly lit barroom. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS437
01:24:17,00 --> 01:24:33,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Purvis> passes in and out of light as he treads forward. Toting a rifle, SOMEONE<Baum> comes up on his left. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Winstead> rounds past a tree. Inside, Baby Face approaches a couple eating dinner. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS438
01:24:31,00 --> 01:24:37,50
He pats a guy on a bar stool and faces the couple. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS439
01:24:39,00 --> 01:24:55,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Purvis> spies a window framing a view of two women, a tuxedoed man, and a fourth person drinking and smoking inside. As he stalks closer, the three working-class men exit the lodge. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS440
01:24:52,00 --> 01:24:58,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> watches them closely from behind a tree. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS441
01:24:57,00 --> 01:25:02,50
The workmen get into a car. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS442
01:25:00,00 --> 01:25:08,50
Inside SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> room, a framed religious icon hangs on the wall over his bed as he rests. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS443
01:25:07,00 --> 01:25:13,50
Outside, the car backs up. SOMEONE<Purvis> aims his SOMEONE<Tommy> gun. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS444
01:25:27,00 --> 01:25:33,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> springs awake, grabs his SOMEONE<Tommy> gun, and goes to a window. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS445
01:25:31,00 --> 01:25:37,50
In the barroom, Baby Face returns fire through a window. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS446
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:56,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> takes cover. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS447
01:25:59,00 --> 01:26:04,50
For the car shells fires from the lawn. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS448
01:26:06,00 --> 01:26:18,50
One man sits slack-jawed, his head lolled back trailing blood from two holes. SOMEONE<Purvis> stares, stunned, then opens a rear door. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS451
01:27:11,00 --> 01:27:17,50
An adjacent windows shows a gangster taking aim. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS452
01:27:23,00 --> 01:27:29,50
He hustles through a guest room next door and butts a window with his gun. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS453
01:27:30,00 --> 01:27:39,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> and SOMEONE<Red> escape onto a rooftop and hop down to a dark yard at the other side of the lodge. Now in the barroom. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS454
01:27:39,00 --> 01:27:44,50
Follows Baby Face who backs up to a side door. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS455
01:27:50,00 --> 01:27:54,50
Someone splinter the door. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS456
01:27:58,00 --> 01:28:03,50
The criminal is escaping. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS457
01:28:07,00 --> 01:28:11,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> eyes SOMEONE<Baum>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS458
01:28:11,00 --> 01:28:18,50
SOMEONE<Baum> heads off. As SOMEONE<Purvis> shoots the side door, Homer fires back. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS459
01:28:18,00 --> 01:28:22,50
On his way to intercept the fugitive. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS460
01:28:20,00 --> 01:28:25,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> and SOMEONE<Red> make their own escape. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS461
01:28:23,00 --> 01:28:27,50
SOMEONE<Winstead> spots them. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS463
01:28:43,00 --> 01:28:53,50
The agents reach a stand of twin trees and split up. Hurt takes to higher ground while SOMEONE<Winstead> advances on the trail. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS464
01:28:53,00 --> 01:29:03,50
A view through the leafy canopy shows the criminals scurrying off. SOMEONE<Winstead> pitches his hat, sights the men, and fires. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS466
01:29:11,00 --> 01:29:16,50
SOMEONE<Winstead> kneels and opens fire. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS467
01:29:19,00 --> 01:29:23,50
Cover behind a tree and SOMEONE 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS468
01:29:20,00 --> 01:29:26,50
does the same. SOMEONE's<Winstead's> shots clobber the trunk shielding

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS469
01:29:24,00 --> 01:29:33,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> who calmly reloads, his breath mists in the cold night air. He leans out and fires. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS471
01:29:34,00 --> 01:29:45,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> scans the hillside but finds no sign of anyone. SOMEONE<Red> peers over his shoulder from his tree. SOMEONE<Dillinger> relaxes his aim. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS472
01:29:44,00 --> 01:29:48,50
Both men start off. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS473
01:29:47,00 --> 01:29:59,50
SOMEONE<Winstead> lies low behind a tree. Now in slow motion, the criminals run along the misty overlook with SOMEONE<Red> leading the way. Agent Hurt opens fire from uphill. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS474
01:30:05,00 --> 01:30:09,50
SOMEONE<Red> to his feet and they move on. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS475
01:30:07,00 --> 01:30:16,50
SOMEONE<Winstead> resumes tracking the pair. Now, SOMEONE<Dillinger> accost an average man standing outside a cabin. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS476
01:30:17,00 --> 01:30:24,50
Later, SOMEONE<Red> clutches his side. SOMEONE<Dillinger> opens the heisted car's door for him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS477
01:30:25,00 --> 01:30:45,50
Now, Baby Face reaches an unpaved road. Headed his way in a car, SOMEONE<Baum> peers ahead over the steering wheel. Baby Face turns his back to the vehicle as its glaring headlights draw closer. The fugitive waves a hand low, paces backward, and keeps his SOMEONE<Tommy> gun under his coat. SOMEONE<Baum> stops. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS478
01:30:45,00 --> 01:30:51,50
SOMEONE<Baum> climbs out the other door. Baby Face throws him down. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS480
01:30:57,00 --> 01:31:10,50
Baby Face tosses SOMEONE's<Baum's> SOMEONE<Tommy> gun onto the front seat and gets behind the wheel. Now, SOMEONE<Purvis> comes running through the forest. As SOMEONE's<Baum's> car drives off, SOMEONE<Purvis> finds his fallen partner. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS481
01:31:11,00 --> 01:31:17,50
Lead agent doffs his hat and crouches down to his fading colleague. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS482
01:31:20,00 --> 01:31:26,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> glares after the car riding steadily away. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS484
01:31:38,00 --> 01:31:44,50
Coming car while holding up one hand. It's SOMEONE's<Cowley's> team. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS488
01:32:30,00 --> 01:32:36,50
Further ahead. SOMEONE<Purvis> fires. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS493
01:33:21,00 --> 01:33:26,50
He arrives and riddles SOMEONE with bullets. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS495
01:33:35,00 --> 01:33:40,50
Agent SOMEONE fires at SOMEONE empties his pistol into the man.  

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS497
01:33:47,00 --> 01:34:00,50
Baby Face drops onto his back. A plume of exhaled steam jets from his nose once. SOMEONE<Purvis> glares over his aimed pistol. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS498
01:34:02,00 --> 01:34:16,50
Now outside a small town pharmacy, SOMEONE<Dillinger> returns to the heisted car. SOMEONE<Red> leans sweating and bloody in the corner of the backseat. SOMEONE<Dillinger> pours antiseptic over SOMEONE's<Red's> wounded abdomen. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS499
01:34:16,00 --> 01:34:21,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> fuses with other supplies. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS500
01:34:23,00 --> 01:34:27,50
He applies gauze to the wound. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS501
01:34:29,00 --> 01:34:34,50
SOMEONE<Red> trains his puffy, exhausted eyes on SOMEONE<Dillinger>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS502
01:34:50,00 --> 01:34:55,50
A feeble smile on SOMEONE's<Red's> lips fades. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS503
01:34:54,00 --> 01:35:00,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> slumps a little then sits back. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS504
01:35:00,00 --> 01:35:06,50
His blood-stained hand lets go of SOMEONE's<Red's> shoulder. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS505
01:35:06,00 --> 01:35:20,50
Eyes downcast, SOMEONE<Dillinger> stays seated by his deceased partner. He swallows, glancing at SOMEONE<Red>, and his lips give a brief irritated sneer. He gazes downward. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS506
01:35:20,00 --> 01:35:26,50
Now in a field office, SOMEONE<Purvis> faces his agents. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS507
01:36:09,00 --> 01:36:16,50
SOMEONE<Billie> checks her watch then turns up a radio, windows behind her show the passing train. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS508
01:36:19,00 --> 01:36:47,50
SOMEONE<Billie> crosses the roomy rundown apartment then doubles back to a door. A woman with similar short hair comes down a staircase, hands SOMEONE<Billie> a large, brown paper bag, and follows her into the apartment. As SOMEONE<Billie> dons her fur-collared coat, the newcomer takes SOMEONE's<Billie's> seat by the radio. The woman wears a top similar to SOMEONE's<Billie's>. As she skims a newspaper and turns up the radio, another elevated train passes in the windows. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS509
01:36:51,00 --> 01:36:55,50
G-Men watch the apartment. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS510
01:36:55,00 --> 01:37:04,50
In another car, two more agents see someone in an overcoat and fedora totting a paper bag across a dark alley. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS511
01:37:05,00 --> 01:37:15,50
The stranger ducks down a narrow passage and reaches out with a delicate hand to a brick wall. It's SOMEONE<Billie> in disguise. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS512
01:37:15,00 --> 01:37:27,50
She comes to a street on the other end. Carrying the brown paper bag, she steps off the sidewalk between parked cars and looks around in the middle of the street. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS513
01:37:29,00 --> 01:37:39,50
A car's headlights illuminate and shine on her anxious face. Situated about a block away, the car approaches and comes to a stop. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS516
01:37:48,00 --> 01:37:52,50
Her head on his shoulder. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS518
01:37:58,00 --> 01:38:04,50
The agents abruptly gaze out the door. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS519
01:38:04,00 --> 01:38:10,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> steps forward, arms folded across his chest. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS520
01:38:11,00 --> 01:38:22,50
In the outer office, the solemn burly agent stands with his partner. As SOMEONE<Purvis> gazes at them, his eyes water and he works his lips. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS521
01:38:23,00 --> 01:38:28,50
SOMEONE<Nitti> listens to the radio. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS528
01:39:02,00 --> 01:39:16,50
And lists a phone number. As an agent stands by, two female operators work an adjacent switchboard. Now outside on a moonlit shoreline, SOMEONE<Dillinger> sits by a sleeping SOMEONE<Billie>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS529
01:39:23,00 --> 01:39:28,50
Her hair hangs in her face. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS530
01:39:28,00 --> 01:39:36,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> gazes at her and brushes her dark hair aside to reveal her big eyes. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS531
01:40:00,00 --> 01:40:05,50
She briefly lowers her gaze. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS532
01:40:20,00 --> 01:40:24,50
She smiles. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS533
01:40:49,00 --> 01:40:52,50
Turn in his arms. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS534
01:40:51,00 --> 01:41:01,50
Horizon sprawls perfectly flat between the sand and black sky. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS535
01:41:03,00 --> 01:41:09,50
Daytime. SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> car parks on a street. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS537
01:41:30,00 --> 01:41:34,50
Street between passing vehicles. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS538
01:41:35,00 --> 01:41:49,50
She enters the building. In the car, SOMEONE<Dillinger> faces the side mirror and brushes his bangs off his forehead. Inside, SOMEONE<Billie> passes through another doorway and SOMEONE'<Purvis'> men grab her. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS539
01:41:53,00 --> 01:41:58,50
Uncomfortably glances at the agents. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS540
01:41:59,00 --> 01:42:04,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Dillinger> waits in the car. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS541
01:42:03,00 --> 01:42:09,50
More armed agents exit a building directly in front of him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS543
01:42:18,00 --> 01:42:26,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> glares into his side view mirror, then gets out of the car. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS544
01:42:26,00 --> 01:42:32,50
The two lovers make eye contact. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS546
01:42:35,00 --> 01:42:41,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> steps forward with a pistol in hand. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS547
01:42:39,00 --> 01:42:52,50
Burly agent pushes SOMEONE<Billie> into the backseat and gets in next to her. As they drive away, SOMEONE<Billie> peers through the back window seating between two agents.  

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS548
01:42:49,00 --> 01:42:57,50
A shocked SOMEONE<Dillinger> stands out in the open watching the car drive off. Several armed agents remain behind who strides around a parked car. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS550
01:43:11,00 --> 01:43:16,50
He calmly bows his head and collects his breath. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS552
01:43:34,00 --> 01:43:38,50
SOMEONE<who> sits in a chair. SOMEONE stands behind him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS553
01:43:46,00 --> 01:43:51,50
She slouches, her left cheek bruised. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS554
01:43:51,00 --> 01:43:55,50
He grabs her chin. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS555
01:43:57,00 --> 01:44:05,50
He flings her head to the side and stands upright. The interrogator steps out of the room. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS556
01:44:05,00 --> 01:44:13,50
SOMEONE<Billie> trembles, her right hand cuffed to the chair. She holds her knees together. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS557
01:44:13,00 --> 01:44:23,50
In the outer office, the burly agent downs a paper cup of water and passes Doris who glares at him as he returns to the interrogation room. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS558
01:44:29,00 --> 01:44:35,50
Now, the interrogator returns, shuts the door, and eyes SOMEONE<Billie>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS559
01:44:35,00 --> 01:44:40,50
He crosses to her and grabs her chin again. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS560
01:44:42,00 --> 01:44:46,50
He grabs her chin. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS561
01:44:45,00 --> 01:44:49,50
He shakes her. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS562
01:44:48,00 --> 01:44:53,50
SOMEONE's<Billie's> mouth hangs open and she shudders. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS563
01:44:53,00 --> 01:44:59,50
Her lips tremble as she finds words. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS564
01:45:24,00 --> 01:45:29,50
Office, the interrogator points to Doris. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS565
01:45:34,00 --> 01:45:39,50
She holds a telephone at her shoulder. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS566
01:45:40,00 --> 01:45:45,50
He puts on his jacket. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS567
01:45:43,00 --> 01:45:49,50
Things and move out. Doris dials a telephone. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS568
01:45:48,00 --> 01:45:57,50
Agents run up a stairwell. Standing outside an apartment door, one shoots the top and bottom hinges. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS569
01:45:59,00 --> 01:46:06,50
Through an open window. The place is empty. The burly agent stiffens his jaw. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS570
01:46:04,00 --> 01:46:14,50
Now back in the interrogation room, SOMEONE<Billie> sits with her head down. The two agents barge in. The burly one grabs a phone book. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS571
01:46:17,00 --> 01:46:23,50
She keeps her head down and looks directly at him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS572
01:46:33,00 --> 01:46:39,50
As SOMEONE<Purvis> enters the field office, Doris approaches. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS573
01:46:38,00 --> 01:46:43,50
In the interrogation room. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS574
01:47:05,00 --> 01:47:16,50
She lowers her head and wipes her mouth. The interrogator glares down at her and tensely wipes his mouth. SOMEONE<Billie> looks him in the eye. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS575
01:47:23,00 --> 01:47:30,50
He sneers and winds up with his fist. SOMEONE<Winstead> intercepts his arm and slams him

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS577
01:47:35,00 --> 01:47:40,50
He uncuffs SOMEONE's<Billie's> right arm from the chair. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS578
01:47:39,00 --> 01:47:45,50
As she holds her wrists, SOMEONE<Purvis> leans over to her. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS579
01:47:49,00 --> 01:47:57,50
He stands upright. SOMEONE<Billie> presses down on the arms of the chair to get up, then stops. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS580
01:47:58,00 --> 01:48:18,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> glances at the other interrogator, then lifts SOMEONE<Billie> from the chair and carries her out. In the hall, the rest of the agents stand aside as he passes with the weakened woman. In the interrogation room, SOMEONE<Winstead> lowers his arm from the burly agent's throat and leaves. Now, SOMEONE<Purvis> nods to Doris. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS581
01:48:20,00 --> 01:48:29,50
In the interrogation room, the burly agent stays put beside the open door out of the sight line of his peers who's staring. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS582
01:48:30,00 --> 01:48:34,50
SOMEONE<Marty> dials a payphone. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS583
01:48:32,00 --> 01:48:36,50
In his home, SOMEONE<Nitti> answers. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS584
01:48:50,00 --> 01:48:57,50
Now, a woman sits at a bar. A door opens across the room. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS585
01:48:55,00 --> 01:49:01,50
SOMEONE<Marty> enters and takes a seat next to her. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS586
01:49:10,00 --> 01:49:17,50
Her weary gaze hangs straight ahead, then she looks directly at SOMEONE<Marty>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS587
01:49:25,00 --> 01:49:31,50
He takes her hand and gazes into her eyes. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS588
01:49:34,00 --> 01:49:40,50
They pick up their drinks and share another glance. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS589
01:49:39,00 --> 01:49:43,50
They both sip. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS590
01:49:45,00 --> 01:49:52,50
Now at night, a lake reflects city lights. SOMEONE<Marty> leads SOMEONE<Anna> to a car. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS591
01:49:52,00 --> 01:49:58,50
She gets in back and gazes at the unseen driver. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS592
01:50:01,00 --> 01:50:06,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> seats at the wheel. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS593
01:51:09,00 --> 01:51:16,50
SOMEONE<Anna> averts her gaze. SOMEONE<Purvis> stares at the helpless informant. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS594
01:51:33,00 --> 01:51:40,50
Gets out of the car. SOMEONE'<Purvis'> gaze follows her as she walks around his vehicle. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS596
01:51:46,00 --> 01:51:56,50
He wears a straw boater hat and sports a trim mustache. He steps out to meet SOMEONE<Piquett> and they sit on a roadside park bench. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS597
01:51:55,00 --> 01:52:00,50
SOMEONE<Piquett> reaches into his coat. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS598
01:51:58,00 --> 01:52:17,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> unfolds the page to reveal a handwritten message. Dear SOMEONE<John>, don't try and break me out. I'm too well-guarded. Two years is not a long time anyway. Go someplace safe and wait for me. We will be together again. Your true love in life, SOMEONE<Billie>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS599
01:52:18,00 --> 01:52:23,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> folds up the note. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS600
01:52:30,00 --> 01:52:38,50
Stands and walks away. SOMEONE<Piquett> puts on his hat and heads off in the opposite direction. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS601
01:52:36,00 --> 01:52:45,50
Now at a stone wall, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and other men look down at an idling steam locomotive. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS602
01:53:28,00 --> 01:53:35,50
Now, SOMEONE<Anna> sits at a kitchen table fanning herself with a magazine. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS604
01:53:37,00 --> 01:53:45,50
He crosses the room. SOMEONE's<Anna's> fanning motion slows as her knowing gaze follows him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS605
01:53:46,00 --> 01:53:56,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> glances around the living room, then returns to the kitchen. He goes to the sink and washes his hands. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS606
01:54:06,00 --> 01:54:10,50
SOMEONE<Anna> glances at a door. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS608
01:54:25,00 --> 01:54:38,50
He dries his hands with a towel and leads the way through the house to the front door. They leave and our view returns to SOMEONE<Anna> who remains at the table covering her mouth with her hand. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS609
01:54:36,00 --> 01:54:43,50
Now, SOMEONE<Madala> crosses the field office to SOMEONE<Purvis> who sits on a desk. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS610
01:54:45,00 --> 01:54:49,50
As he eagerly takes the call. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS611
01:54:48,00 --> 01:54:56,50
As he listens, SOMEONE<Winstead> looks up from a newspaper. SOMEONE<Purvis> lowers the phone and turns to his peers. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS612
01:54:57,00 --> 01:55:01,50
The agents gather. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS613
01:55:15,00 --> 01:55:19,50
All eyes turn to SOMEONE<Winstead>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS614
01:55:19,00 --> 01:55:23,50
He checks a newspaper. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS615
01:55:48,00 --> 01:55:54,50
Now, SOMEONE<Dillinger> pulls up to a building with Polly. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS616
01:55:57,00 --> 01:56:03,50
Above the entrance, he sees the sign for the Chicago Police Department. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS617
01:56:05,00 --> 01:56:11,50
They enter the building through a set of double doors. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS618
01:56:13,00 --> 01:56:21,50
She goes off and SOMEONE<Dillinger> steps forward, casually chewing gum as he glances around. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS619
01:56:19,00 --> 01:56:32,50
An elevator door opens and SOMEONE<Dillinger> steps aboard among a few other men, including a uniformed officer. He glances at the elevator operator and the door glides shut. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS620
01:56:33,00 --> 01:56:50,50
On another floor, SOMEONE<Dillinger> crosses a hall to a door bearing the words Detective Bureau SOMEONE<Dillinger> Squad. He enters the quiet office, passing a row of empty chairs against the wall of a waiting area. Daylight shines in through a window. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS621
01:56:54,00 --> 01:57:00,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> hikes up his pants as he enters the main office. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS622
01:56:58,00 --> 01:57:06,50
He turns to a bulletin board where multiple mugshots of familiar criminals hang posted. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS623
01:57:05,00 --> 01:57:12,50
He crosses to a desk and halts briefly by a secretary busy typing. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS624
01:57:13,00 --> 01:57:20,50
A couple of yards ahead, an agent on the phone sits at his desk, unaware of SOMEONE's 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS625
01:57:18,00 --> 01:58:13,50
presence. The gangster finds another bulletin board and scans its postings. A mugshot of Homer, photos of a robbed bank and a sprawled body, and a street map. A smile crosses SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> lips as he passes through a brilliant shot of sunlight. Further along the bulletin board, he finds black and white photos of himself - others show more buildings. SOMEONE<Dillinger> lowers his sunglasses and views photos of the Little Bohemia Lodge, the wrecked Ford, and a pair of confiscated SOMEONE<Tommy> guns. Now, he crosses to a bulletin board showing mugshots of SOMEONE<Billie>. One is ink-stamped with the words In Custody. SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> gaze roves down a line of mugshots showing Makley, SOMEONE<Pete>, SOMEONE<Tommy>, Homer, SOMEONE<Red>, Gil, and Youngblood, all stamped with the word Deceased. The last mugshot of SOMEONE<Dillinger> himself remains unstamped. SOMEONE<Dillinger> lowers his shades and meets his mugshot's stern gaze. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS626
01:58:22,00 --> 01:58:29,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> rounds a corner and spies a group of agents surround the radio. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS627
01:58:28,00 --> 01:58:33,50
One man glances over. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS628
01:58:34,00 --> 01:58:39,50
Unrecognized, SOMEONE<Dillinger> moves on. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS629
01:58:45,00 --> 01:58:49,50
In a cinema lobby, using a public phone, a fair-haired agent scans his surroundings. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS630
01:58:47,00 --> 01:58:54,50
using a public phone, a fair-haired agent scans his surroundings. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS631
01:58:52,00 --> 01:59:03,50
Another agent ends the call. Gazing across the street, he shakes his head. A marquee reads Biograph Manhattan Melodrama. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS632
01:59:01,00 --> 01:59:20,50
At the wheel of a parked car, SOMEONE<Madala> looks to SOMEONE<Purvis> seated shotgun. Now, by a lamp's modest light, a shaving kit lies open on a small round table. A handgun lies beside it. Facing a mirror, SOMEONE<Dillinger> drags a razor down his lathered cheek. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS633
01:59:18,00 --> 01:59:25,50
He finishes shaving and opens his pocket watch, eyeing SOMEONE's<Billie's> photo and the time. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS634
01:59:24,00 --> 01:59:31,50
He shuts the watch, puts it away, and pockets the gun. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS635
01:59:33,00 --> 01:59:48,50
Parked near the Biograph, SOMEONE<Purvis> tensely rubs his thin-lipped mouth. At the box office, a few anonymous patrons mill into the theater. The agent looks away, shifting his anxious gaze. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS636
01:59:46,00 --> 01:59:52,50
He gets out of the car and paces down the sidewalk. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS637
01:59:52,00 --> 02:00:03,50
He stops, turns, and puts his back to the cinema. Behind him, a man arrives with two blonde women, one of them in a conspicuous orange skirt. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS638
02:00:03,00 --> 02:00:38,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> blinks, then looks over his shoulder. Spotting the trio, he looks away. Across the street, SOMEONE<Dillinger> accompanies the two women into the cinema, passing a Manhattan Melodrama poster. Entering the packed house, the crime boss leaves SOMEONE<Anna> at a seat, then proceeds down the aisle with Polly. They find adjacent seats as opening titles appear on the screen featuring the stars' pictures. They read Clark Gable, SOMEONE<William> Powell, Manhattan Melodrama. In the packed audience, SOMEONE<Dillinger> stares intently at the screen through his spectacles. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS641
02:00:44,00 --> 02:00:50,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Purvis> addresses his agents. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS644
02:01:22,00 --> 02:01:27,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> pats SOMEONE's<Winstead's> shoulder. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS645
02:01:25,00 --> 02:01:29,50
The team splits up. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS646
02:01:27,00 --> 02:01:38,50
In the movie house, the crowd watches figures on screen playing hockey, then Clark Gable washing his hands in a men's room. Another character walks in. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS647
02:01:39,00 --> 02:01:45,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> gazes at the screen with a boyish smirk. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS648
02:01:45,00 --> 02:02:05,50
Sitting in her own, SOMEONE<Anna> turns, peeking nervously over her shoulder. She faces the screen again, her chest heaving. Outside, the agents take their positions, SOMEONE<Winstead> and Hurt ducking to a storefront's recessed entryway. In the movie house, SOMEONE<Dillinger> watches the screen with a furrowed brow. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS649
02:02:12,00 --> 02:02:37,50
Leading lady Myrna Loy stares with her mouth agape. SOMEONE<Dillinger> gazes at her with a knitted brow and clenched jaw. In a fur-collared coat, the exotically pretty actress wears a pensive expression. Later, she shifts her sober gaze. Later still, she turns away from a door, clad in black. Taking a deep breath, she manages a brave nod. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS650
02:02:34,00 --> 02:02:57,50
Blinking back tears, she opens the door and hurries out. Clark Gable stares after her. SOMEONE<Dillinger> watches with shining eyes. Outside, SOMEONE<Purvis> checks his watch. Posted near the box office, he looks across the street. SOMEONE<Winstead> and Hurt wait patiently in the recessed storefront. SOMEONE<Purvis> turns, gazing toward the cinema lobby. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS651
02:02:56,00 --> 02:03:04,50
On the movie screen, Clark Gable faces SOMEONE<William> Powell. He dons a cocky smile. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS652
02:03:16,00 --> 02:03:45,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> watches with a defiant smirk. Onscreen, Gable turns away from Powell who draws a deep breath and heads into a cell block. A guard follows, closes a prison door, and locks it. Outside the theater, SOMEONE<Purvis> digs a box of matches from his pocket and takes one out. From his breast pocket, he produces a cigar and holds it ready. On the movie screen, Gable makes his way down the cell block flanked by guards. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS654
02:03:47,00 --> 02:03:54,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> wears a faint sad smile as Gable faces a fellow convict. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS655
02:03:58,00 --> 02:04:05,50
SOMEONE<Dillinger> wears a faint half-smile, his eyes shining. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS656
02:04:04,00 --> 02:04:11,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Purvis> shifts his tense, vigilant gaze. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS657
02:04:09,00 --> 02:04:20,50
In the movie house, words on the screen read The End. The patrons stand, filing out of their rows.  

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS658
02:04:19,00 --> 02:04:26,50
A few rows down, SOMEONE<Dillinger> stands with Polly and SOMEONE<don> his straw hat. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS659
02:04:24,00 --> 02:04:29,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Purvis> watches the exit. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS661
02:04:31,00 --> 02:04:50,50
At the storefront, SOMEONE<Winstead> stand ready. In the parked car, the burly agent sweats at the wheel. His right hand trembles severely and he uses his left to steady it. Near the cinema door, SOMEONE<Purvis> watches movie patrons exiting the lobby. He faces the street, strikes the match, and lights his cigar. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS662
02:04:50,00 --> 02:05:00,50
With a hostile sneer, the burly agent rushes out of the car. Now, SOMEONE<Dillinger> steps into plain view walking between SOMEONE<Anna> and Polly. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS663
02:05:00,00 --> 02:05:07,50
Younger friend wears a carefree grin. Keeping apace. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS664
02:05:08,00 --> 02:05:15,50
A bystander aside, SOMEONE<Purvis> heads down the sidewalk after them. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS665
02:05:14,00 --> 02:05:22,50
Burly agent joins the flow of foot traffic with his gun raised. SOMEONE<Zarkovich> notices and roughly

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS667
02:05:27,00 --> 02:05:33,50
Across the street, SOMEONE<Winstead> and Hurt leave the recessed storefront. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS668
02:05:32,00 --> 02:05:40,50
Agent scowls, holding his aim as he gains on the crime boss.  

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS673
02:06:23,00 --> 02:06:44,50
To his cheek, spewing blood and tissue. Two crimson stains bloom on his shirt front as Hurt fires twice from behind. SOMEONE<Dillinger> falls face down, eyes staring off as blood streams from his ruptured cheek. SOMEONE<Purvis> stares, then ventures forward. As SOMEONE<Dillinger> lies dying, his lips move. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS674
02:06:45,00 --> 02:06:52,50
SOMEONE<Winstead> removes his hat, crouches, and leans his ear close to SOMEONE<Dillinger>. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS675
02:06:52,00 --> 02:07:02,50
The agent narrows his eye, glances at the fallen man, and withdraws, revealing SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> lifeless stare. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS676
02:07:00,00 --> 02:07:07,50
SOMEONE<Winstead> gets to his feet, his sober gaze locked on the dead man. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS677
02:07:06,00 --> 02:07:17,50
He holsters his gun and SOMEONE<Purvis> joins his side. As the younger G-Man eyes the body, SOMEONE<Winstead> dons his hat, his stare stoic and grim. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS678
02:07:16,00 --> 02:07:20,50
The older man faces him. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS679
02:07:19,00 --> 02:07:34,50
SOMEONE<Purvis> eyes him long and steady. SOMEONE<Winstead> glances away, then looks SOMEONE<Purvis> in the eye. SOMEONE<Marty> leans in for a good look at SOMEONE's<Dillinger's> body, then heads off. Polly averts her gaze. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS682
02:08:08,00 --> 02:08:15,50
SOMEONE<Winstead> lights a cigarette and pensively looks away. More onlookers converge on the scene. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS683
02:08:20,00 --> 02:08:24,50
Flare's subtle light. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS686
02:08:43,00 --> 02:08:52,50
Clad in a simple gray dress, she wears a dull expression. As the matron ushers her to another, the prisoner 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS687
02:08:50,00 --> 02:09:04,50
maintains her dispassionate gaze. In the visiting room, the door opens. SOMEONE<Winstead> stands as SOMEONE<Billie> enters. She stares guardedly at him, then takes the seat facing his. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS688
02:09:06,00 --> 02:09:14,50
SOMEONE<Winstead> sits. Leaning forward, he faces her with a knitted brow. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS689
02:09:13,00 --> 02:09:20,50
SOMEONE<Billie> swallows, blinks her glistening eyes, then gives a stony nod. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS690
02:09:28,00 --> 02:09:43,50
SOMEONE<Billie> glares coldly. SOMEONE<Winstead> opens a gold cigarette case and briefly thumbs the contents. He turns the case, offering the grieving woman a cigarette. She sneers. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS691
02:09:43,00 --> 02:09:49,50
Instead pockets the cigarette case. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS692
02:09:55,00 --> 02:10:00,50
The agent stares solemnly. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS693
02:09:59,00 --> 02:10:04,50
SOMEONE<Billie> narrows her eyes. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS694
02:10:05,00 --> 02:10:10,50
Her defiant sneer fades. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS697
02:10:34,00 --> 02:10:39,50
Meeting SOMEONE's<Winstead's> gaze, she gives a nod. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS701
02:10:48,00 --> 02:10:55,50
Eyes closed, SOMEONE<Billie> slowly shakes her head and takes a deep breath. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS702
02:10:54,00 --> 02:10:58,50
Young woman gazes off with a solemn 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS703
02:10:55,00 --> 02:11:00,50
and careworn expression. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS704
02:11:03,00 --> 02:11:08,50
SOMEONE's<Billie's> lips hinted a wistful smile. 

PUBLIC_ENEMIES_DVS705
02:11:10,00 --> 02:11:16,50
In his head. The gray door opens and he steps out.
