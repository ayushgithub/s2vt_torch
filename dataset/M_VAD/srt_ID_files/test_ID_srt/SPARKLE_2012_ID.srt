SPARKLE_2012_DVS18
00:02:52,00 --> 00:02:59,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> and the sharp-dressed man lock eyes as she passes the bar. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS19
00:03:02,00 --> 00:03:07,50
The MC ogles SOMEONE<Sister> as she steps to the mic. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS21
00:03:08,00 --> 00:03:13,50
SOMEONE<Sister> nods to the band. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS22
00:03:10,00 --> 00:03:17,50
SOMEONE<Red> stage lights glisten on her shiny silver dress, as she swings her hips. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS23
00:03:40,00 --> 00:03:45,50
Black approaches the sharp-dressed man. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS24
00:04:11,00 --> 00:04:18,50
Black and the manager fixate on the seductive singer. SOMEONE<Sparkle> beams and shakes her head. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS25
00:04:30,00 --> 00:04:36,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> lip syncs as SOMEONE<Sister> grabs the mic and a tambourine. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS27
00:04:56,00 --> 00:05:01,50
SOMEONE<Sister> shakes the tambourine overhead. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS29
00:05:06,00 --> 00:05:14,50
She sets down the microphone and leaves the stage. SOMEONE<Sparkle> applauds with a radiant smile as SOMEONE<Sister> approaches. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS30
00:05:20,00 --> 00:05:25,50
Black primps his hair as SOMEONE<Sister> approaches. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS31
00:05:45,00 --> 00:05:53,50
The swinging double doors close on the manager as SOMEONE<Sister> and SOMEONE<Sparkle> leave. Smiling, he turns back to the club. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS32
00:05:51,00 --> 00:06:02,50
Now the sisters board a public bus and pay the fare. SOMEONE<Sparkle> smiles adoringly, and follows SOMEONE<Sister> past several other passengers to the back. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS34
00:06:31,00 --> 00:06:37,50
SOMEONE<Sister> removes her jacket and sees a man leering at her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS35
00:06:37,00 --> 00:06:47,50
He smiles and turns back around. SOMEONE<Sparkle> stands and spreads her coat's lapel, creating a screen behind which SOMEONE<Sister> can change. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS36
00:06:44,00 --> 00:06:53,50
Gazing out the window, she smiles at the Filmore marquee which reads, "MSOMEONE Gaye, Saturday 9:00 PM. " 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS37
00:06:51,00 --> 00:06:59,50
The image fades to colorful blurry lights and a title fades in on the foreground, SOMEONE<Sparkle>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS38
00:06:56,00 --> 00:07:07,50
Now the sisters hurry up a quiet suburban driveway past a white Sedan, and approach a side entrance. A young woman wearing a pink nightie and curlers opens the door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS39
00:07:08,00 --> 00:07:13,50
They follow her inside. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS40
00:07:10,00 --> 00:07:16,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> carefully closes the door and hurries after them. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS41
00:07:13,00 --> 00:07:19,50
Now they tiptoe up a square spiral staircase in the dark. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS42
00:07:17,00 --> 00:07:22,50
An elegant chandelier hangs in the middle. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS43
00:07:26,00 --> 00:07:40,50
At the top, the woman in pink hesitates, then leads them down the hallway and into a bedroom. The hallway light suddenly comes on, and a stern woman wearing a green nightgown and curlers emerges from an adjacent bedroom. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS44
00:07:38,00 --> 00:07:46,50
The girls scurry into a queen-size bed and pull over the blankets, pretending to sleep. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS45
00:07:43,00 --> 00:07:50,50
The woman enters and flicks the light switch on. She smiles and shakes her head. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS46
00:08:11,00 --> 00:08:18,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> hides a smile as SOMEONE<Dolores> glares at her. And then at SOMEONE<Sister>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS47
00:08:19,00 --> 00:08:23,50
She smacks SOMEONE's<Sparkle's> forehead. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS48
00:08:22,00 --> 00:08:26,50
At church. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS49
00:08:26,00 --> 00:08:32,50
The packed congregation sits before the reverend in the pulpit. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS50
00:08:47,00 --> 00:08:51,50
The three sisters sit among the choir. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS51
00:08:53,00 --> 00:08:59,50
In a pew, the manager sits with a stubble-faced man. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS53
00:09:18,00 --> 00:09:27,50
The old woman sits back. SOMEONE<Levi> rolls his neck and sits up straight. The guys look toward the choir. The manager chuckles. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS55
00:09:30,00 --> 00:09:35,50
The manager approaches her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS56
00:09:37,00 --> 00:09:42,50
She nervously glances around, and he smiles. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS58
00:10:35,00 --> 00:10:44,50
SOMEONE<Dolores>, sporting a chin length SOMEONE<bob>, parks the car close by and moves to the passenger seat. SOMEONE<Emma> looks at SOMEONE<Sparkle> and SOMEONE<Stix>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS59
00:10:45,00 --> 00:10:49,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> turns to SOMEONE<Stix>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS60
00:10:52,00 --> 00:10:58,50
As she turns away, the big smile grows on her face. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS61
00:10:55,00 --> 00:11:02,50
SOMEONE<Stix> flashes a warm smile to her mother, who returns a stern glare. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS62
00:10:59,00 --> 00:11:06,50
Now at the Anderson house, the Bible study group watches a comedian on the color TV. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS64
00:11:18,00 --> 00:11:25,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> shoots SOMEONE<Dolores> a dirty look. SOMEONE<Levi> whispers to SOMEONE<Stix>, who shrugs. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS66
00:11:36,00 --> 00:11:43,50
SOMEONE<Satin> mugs a wide-mouth smile. Now SOMEONE<Levi> finds SOMEONE<Sister> smoking a cigarette. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS67
00:11:54,00 --> 00:11:59,50
SOMEONE<Sister> raises her brow. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS68
00:12:01,00 --> 00:12:11,50
SOMEONE<Sister> glances from her mother to SOMEONE<Levi>. With a judgmental look, SOMEONE<Emma> turns away. Smiling, SOMEONE<Sister> draws on her cigarette and exhales. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS69
00:12:08,00 --> 00:12:13,50
On the TV, a band plays. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS71
00:12:27,00 --> 00:12:31,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> stops dancing. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS72
00:12:48,00 --> 00:12:54,50
SOMEONE<Emma> raises her brow, and sets her Bible down. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS73
00:12:55,00 --> 00:13:00,50
As she leaves the room, SOMEONE<Sister> faces the group. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS74
00:12:59,00 --> 00:13:05,50
They sit with open Bibles as she turns the TV back on. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS75
00:13:03,00 --> 00:13:09,50
SOMEONE<Sister> dances and the others close their Bibles. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS76
00:13:07,00 --> 00:13:12,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> sets hers down and smiles. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS78
00:13:18,00 --> 00:13:23,50
SOMEONE<Sister> rolls her eyes and clicks the TV off. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS79
00:13:23,00 --> 00:13:31,50
As the group leaves, SOMEONE<Stix> sees SOMEONE<Levi> walk away from the front door, and deeper into the house. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS80
00:13:28,00 --> 00:13:35,50
The rest of the group departs, leaving SOMEONE<Stix> in the living room with SOMEONE<Sparkle>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS81
00:13:32,00 --> 00:13:37,50
He hands her a Bible, and she sets it down. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS82
00:13:41,00 --> 00:13:46,50
He eyes her as she walks away. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS83
00:13:46,00 --> 00:13:50,50
He notices SOMEONE<Sister>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS85
00:13:54,00 --> 00:13:59,50
SOMEONE<Sister> ignores him and keeps walking. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS86
00:13:56,00 --> 00:14:02,50
He tries to follow her, but ducks behind a wall avoiding SOMEONE<Emma>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS87
00:13:59,00 --> 00:14:05,50
Standing in the archway, the resolute mother scans the room. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS88
00:14:08,00 --> 00:14:14,50
SOMEONE<Stix> steps out from his hiding place, and peers around the corner. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS89
00:14:12,00 --> 00:14:18,50
The young manager creeps across the wood floor past the staircase. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS90
00:14:17,00 --> 00:14:23,50
He approaches the door of the room SOMEONE<Sister> entered and stops. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS91
00:14:24,00 --> 00:14:28,50
He turns in a different direction. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS92
00:14:26,00 --> 00:14:33,50
In another room, SOMEONE<Sparkle> wears glasses and plays an upright piano alone. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS93
00:14:30,00 --> 00:14:38,50
Unnoticed, SOMEONE<Stix> approaches a doorway and finds the reserved beauty singing with her eyes closed. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS94
00:15:21,00 --> 00:15:25,50
She notices SOMEONE<Stix>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS95
00:15:35,00 --> 00:15:40,50
She smiles and looks away. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS96
00:15:52,00 --> 00:15:56,50
She grabs her book from him. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS97
00:16:49,00 --> 00:16:54,50
As she plays, SOMEONE<Stix> moves near her smiling. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS99
00:16:52,00 --> 00:16:59,50
In the girl's bedroom, SOMEONE<Sparkle> sits in bed wearing glasses and writing. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS100
00:16:56,00 --> 00:17:02,50
She looks over at SOMEONE<Sister>, who brushes her hair at a vanity table. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS101
00:17:06,00 --> 00:17:11,50
SOMEONE<Sister> looks to the side, and her face sours. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS102
00:17:19,00 --> 00:17:24,50
SOMEONE<Sister> goes to the window and peeks between the curtain. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS103
00:17:22,00 --> 00:17:27,50
Then she turns around and smiles at SOMEONE<Sparkle>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS104
00:17:28,00 --> 00:17:33,50
SOMEONE's<Sparkle's> hands fly to her glasses. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS105
00:17:30,00 --> 00:17:37,50
She removes them and scurries to the window, as SOMEONE<Sister> watches with an amused look. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS106
00:17:35,00 --> 00:17:41,50
Below on the lawn, SOMEONE<Stix> in a suit and tie waves up at SOMEONE<Sparkle>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS107
00:17:38,00 --> 00:17:44,50
She opens the window and props it up with a thick red book. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS108
00:17:48,00 --> 00:17:52,50
SOMEONE<Stix> looks around nervous. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS109
00:18:04,00 --> 00:18:08,50
SOMEONE<Sister> shrugs playfully. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS110
00:18:07,00 --> 00:18:11,50
She rubs her palms. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS114
00:18:35,00 --> 00:18:42,50
One dancer wears a hat tilted over his eyes, a lit cigarette in his mouth. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS115
00:18:45,00 --> 00:18:56,50
A couple kisses in the shadows. SOMEONE<Sparkle> wearing a sleeveless dress, dances with SOMEONE<Stix>. She looks around and sees a silhouetted couple kissing. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS117
00:19:05,00 --> 00:19:12,50
She moves her body closer to his as they dance. She puts one hand around his neck. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS118
00:19:10,00 --> 00:19:14,50
He shimmies up and down. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS119
00:19:16,00 --> 00:19:25,50
Later, SOMEONE<Stix> rides his motorcycle through a reflective white tiled tunnel as SOMEONE<Sparkle> holds on to him from behind. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS120
00:19:22,00 --> 00:19:28,50
She rests her cheek on his shoulder, looking to the side. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS122
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:38,50
As their legs stretched out in front of them. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS123
00:19:43,00 --> 00:19:47,50
She ducks her chin in surprise. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS124
00:19:52,00 --> 00:19:56,50
She raises an eyebrow. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS125
00:20:04,00 --> 00:20:09,50
She furrows her brow. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS126
00:20:17,00 --> 00:20:21,50
She pouts and looks down. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS127
00:21:07,00 --> 00:21:13,50
They turn and see an upstairs light come on in the house. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS128
00:21:12,00 --> 00:21:18,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> looks around nervously, then smiles at SOMEONE<Stix>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS129
00:21:17,00 --> 00:21:22,50
She gets to her feet. He rises. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS130
00:21:26,00 --> 00:21:31,50
He smiles, then takes her face in his hands. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS131
00:21:29,00 --> 00:21:33,50
She closes her eyes as he kisses her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS132
00:21:35,00 --> 00:21:40,50
Her eyes still closed, he pulls back from the kiss. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS133
00:21:43,00 --> 00:21:47,50
She opens her eyes. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS134
00:22:31,00 --> 00:22:35,50
He considers her challenging look. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS135
00:22:39,00 --> 00:22:43,50
She shoulders past him. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS136
00:22:40,00 --> 00:22:46,50
Now SOMEONE<Stix> talks to the sisters in the church cloakroom. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS137
00:23:26,00 --> 00:23:32,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> smirks at him. He turns to SOMEONE<Sparkle> who shrugs. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS138
00:23:40,00 --> 00:23:45,50
He follows SOMEONE<Sparkle> out, then looks back. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS139
00:23:44,00 --> 00:23:49,50
He catches up with her and grabs her arm. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS140
00:23:58,00 --> 00:24:02,50
She stalks off. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS141
00:23:59,00 --> 00:24:07,50
Now at a greasy spoon, SOMEONE<Mike> Douglas interviews SOMEONE<Martin> Luther King Jr. on a black and white TV. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS142
00:24:19,00 --> 00:24:24,50
SOMEONE<Sister> sits at a table with SOMEONE<Levi>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS143
00:24:31,00 --> 00:24:35,50
He lights her cigarette. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS144
00:24:47,00 --> 00:24:51,50
She rolls her eyes. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS145
00:25:01,00 --> 00:25:05,50
She shifts icily. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS146
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:09,50
He gazes into her eyes. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS147
00:25:09,00 --> 00:25:13,50
He tilts his head and smiles. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS148
00:25:29,00 --> 00:25:34,50
She takes a drag on her cigarette and looks down at the table. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS149
00:25:53,00 --> 00:26:00,50
He reaches into his jacket and pulls out a small ring box. He sets it in front of her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS150
00:25:59,00 --> 00:26:04,50
She stubs out her cigarette and picks it up. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS151
00:26:03,00 --> 00:26:11,50
She opens the box, revealing a small black and white picture of a ring where the ring should be. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS152
00:26:16,00 --> 00:26:23,50
They see SOMEONE<Satin> Struthers in a fur trimmed overcoat beside an albino man and well-dressed woman. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS153
00:26:29,00 --> 00:26:33,50
He comes to their table. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS154
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:52,50
SOMEONE<Sister> chuckles with him. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS155
00:26:52,00 --> 00:26:56,50
SOMEONE<Levi> frowns and smooths his shirt. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS156
00:26:56,00 --> 00:27:00,50
He picks up the picture. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS157
00:27:02,00 --> 00:27:07,50
SOMEONE<Satin> wears jeweled rings on both hands. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS158
00:27:06,00 --> 00:27:13,50
SOMEONE<Levi> glares at SOMEONE<Satin>, who glances around the diner and twists his huge ring. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS159
00:27:26,00 --> 00:27:32,50
He and SOMEONE<Sister> share a long glance. He turns to SOMEONE<Levi>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS160
00:27:31,00 --> 00:27:40,50
SOMEONE<Satin> walks back to his friends where SOMEONE<Ham> holds his pretty date on his lap. SOMEONE<Sister> turns to watch them. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS161
00:27:40,00 --> 00:27:44,50
SOMEONE<Levi> puts on his cap. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS162
00:27:41,00 --> 00:27:47,50
She collects her purse and jacket, and heads for the door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS163
00:27:44,00 --> 00:27:51,50
She leaves the box and the little ring picture on the table with the half eaten food and drinks. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS164
00:27:51,00 --> 00:27:56,50
SOMEONE<Levi> slips the box and picture in his pocket. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS165
00:27:56,00 --> 00:28:02,50
As SOMEONE<Levi> opens the door for her, SOMEONE<Sister> looks back at SOMEONE<Satin>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS166
00:27:59,00 --> 00:28:06,50
He takes a flash photo of her, then lowers his camera and smiles. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS167
00:28:03,00 --> 00:28:09,50
She smiles and leaves. Daytime. At SOMEONE's<Emma's> Fashions. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS168
00:28:07,00 --> 00:28:12,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> looks at old snapshots with SOMEONE's<Emma's> friend Sara. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS169
00:28:21,00 --> 00:28:26,50
SOMEONE<Emma> approaches with a dark-skinned mannequin. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS170
00:28:37,00 --> 00:28:41,50
She waves a photo. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS171
00:28:51,00 --> 00:29:01,50
Sara follows SOMEONE<Emma> to the dressing room. SOMEONE<Sparkle> grabs her pocket book. She waves goodbye to a saleswoman and steps out from behind the counter. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS172
00:28:59,00 --> 00:29:07,50
Now a girl wearing knee-high boots and a mini-dress crosses a busy street and enters a record store. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS173
00:29:05,00 --> 00:29:12,50
Inside, two girls dance in slow motion inside a glass listening booth. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS174
00:29:13,00 --> 00:29:20,50
In the next booth, a man wearing earphones, smokes and examines a record album cover. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS175
00:29:20,00 --> 00:29:27,50
In the next booth, a young man in a hat talks to a young lady in a mini-skirt. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS176
00:29:29,00 --> 00:29:34,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> sits alone in the next booth. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS177
00:29:31,00 --> 00:29:37,50
She checks her watch, then examines a record album cover. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS178
00:29:39,00 --> 00:29:43,50
SOMEONE<Stix> knocks on the glass. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS179
00:29:41,00 --> 00:29:47,50
He smiles and waves. But she turns her back to him. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS180
00:29:44,00 --> 00:29:50,50
He glances around, then talks through the glass. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS181
00:29:49,00 --> 00:29:54,50
With her back to him, she breaks into a smile. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS182
00:29:54,00 --> 00:30:03,50
Now in the SOMEONE's<sister's> bedroom, SOMEONE<Dolores> wears curlers and straightens SOMEONE's<Sparkle's> hair. SOMEONE<Sister> walks in wearily. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS183
00:30:06,00 --> 00:30:11,50
SOMEONE<Sister> hands her the check and tosses her purse on the bed. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS184
00:30:15,00 --> 00:30:19,50
SOMEONE<Sister> collapses on the bed. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS185
00:30:18,00 --> 00:30:23,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> nudges SOMEONE<Sparkle>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS186
00:30:29,00 --> 00:30:33,50
SOMEONE<Sister> sits up. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS187
00:30:36,00 --> 00:30:40,50
SOMEONE<Sister> narrows her eyes. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS188
00:30:54,00 --> 00:31:00,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> shoots SOMEONE<Sister> a look. She softens and leans forward. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS190
00:31:08,00 --> 00:31:17,50
Later the sisters get in a white Sedan. The Sedan drives off, and our view leaves a window to find SOMEONE<Emma> asleep on the couch. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS191
00:31:17,00 --> 00:31:26,50
At a nightclub, a drummer beats a rhythm. Outside, SOMEONE<Stix> waits under an awning reading Cliff Bells. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS192
00:31:23,00 --> 00:31:27,50
He checks his wrist watch. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS193
00:31:24,00 --> 00:31:30,50
He sees SOMEONE<Levi> toss the white Sedan's keys to the valet. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS197
00:31:43,00 --> 00:31:49,50
The Anderson sisters spot the group on stage. Sister sighs. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS198
00:31:57,00 --> 00:32:01,50
The trio follow SOMEONE<Stix>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS199
00:32:01,00 --> 00:32:08,50
SOMEONE<Levi> and Sister share a parting gaze. SOMEONE<Levi> shakes hands with a bartender. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS200
00:32:05,00 --> 00:32:14,50
With two lavender clad backup singers behind her, a beaming lead singer in a green dress struts across the stage. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS201
00:32:13,00 --> 00:32:21,50
Sitting at the bar, SOMEONE<Levi> spots SOMEONE<Satin> enter with his entourage. A cameraman snaps a flash photo. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS202
00:32:18,00 --> 00:32:23,50
A bartender brings SOMEONE<Levi> a drink. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS203
00:32:20,00 --> 00:32:26,50
SOMEONE<Levi> fiddles with his jacket and collar as SOMEONE<Satin> approaches. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS204
00:32:23,00 --> 00:32:30,50
On stage, the lead singer holds her hand to her ear like a telephone. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS205
00:32:32,00 --> 00:32:37,50
SOMEONE<Satin> turns and notices SOMEONE<Levi>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS206
00:32:45,00 --> 00:32:49,50
SOMEONE<Stix> joins them. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS207
00:33:06,00 --> 00:33:11,50
SOMEONE<Levi> and SOMEONE<Stix> exchange an excited look. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS209
00:33:26,00 --> 00:33:30,50
SOMEONE<Levi> looks down. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS210
00:33:31,00 --> 00:33:40,50
SOMEONE<Satin> crosses the room, smoking a cigarette. He takes a seat at a booth with SOMEONE<Ham> and their dates. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS211
00:33:37,00 --> 00:33:41,50
SOMEONE<Stix> sits with them. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS212
00:33:38,00 --> 00:33:44,50
SOMEONE's<Levi's> eyes dart around the room as he sips his drink. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS213
00:33:41,00 --> 00:33:49,50
From backstage, Sister spots SOMEONE<Satin> among the crowd. The performers struck a final pose. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS214
00:33:49,00 --> 00:33:54,50
An MC steps to the stage and takes the mic. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS216
00:34:09,00 --> 00:34:15,50
Backstage in an overcoat, Sister approaches her sisters already dressed. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS217
00:34:18,00 --> 00:34:23,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> and SOMEONE<Dolores> head off. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS218
00:34:26,00 --> 00:34:37,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> and SOMEONE<Dolores> step out on stage, each in a black conservative dress. SOMEONE<Stix> blinks wearing a concerned frown. SOMEONE<Sparkle> glances back at the drummer. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS219
00:34:38,00 --> 00:34:44,50
Swaying to the music, SOMEONE<Sparkle> trades a look with SOMEONE<Dolores>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS220
00:34:44,00 --> 00:34:49,50
Sitting at one of the tables, a woman calls out. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS221
00:34:50,00 --> 00:34:55,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> mouths something to SOMEONE<Dolores>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS222
00:34:55,00 --> 00:34:59,50
SOMEONE<Stix> shifts in his seat. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS223
00:35:01,00 --> 00:35:08,50
SOMEONE<Stix> smiles and tugs at his collar. SOMEONE<Levi> shifts his uncertain gaze. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS224
00:35:05,00 --> 00:35:13,50
Sister approaches a center microphone, walking seductively. Her face and body out of focus. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS225
00:35:10,00 --> 00:35:15,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> and SOMEONE<Dolores> glance in her direction. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS226
00:35:13,00 --> 00:35:20,50
Captivated, SOMEONE<Levi> watches from the bar. SOMEONE<Stix> and SOMEONE<Satin> from their table. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS227
00:35:17,00 --> 00:35:24,50
Her face now in focus, the stunning lead singer wraps her fingers around the microphone. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS228
00:35:31,00 --> 00:35:36,50
She runs her hands up and down the mic stand. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS229
00:35:40,00 --> 00:35:44,50
She gestures in SOMEONE's<Satin's> direction. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS230
00:35:46,00 --> 00:35:53,50
The trio dances in unison. Sister wearing a sexy shoulder-less dress. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS231
00:35:54,00 --> 00:36:01,50
Watching Sister's hand caress her thigh, SOMEONE<Levi> sips his drink. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS232
00:35:58,00 --> 00:36:03,50
Sister runs her hand up her arm. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS233
00:36:12,00 --> 00:36:20,50
Sister glances at SOMEONE<Sparkle>. Men in military uniforms watch from the back of the club. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS235
00:36:56,00 --> 00:37:04,50
A smiling man in uniform claps his hands. The other patrons snap their fingers and clap. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS236
00:37:02,00 --> 00:37:06,50
Sister points to SOMEONE<Satin>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS238
00:37:08,00 --> 00:37:13,50
SOMEONE<Levi> lowers his gaze. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS239
00:37:17,00 --> 00:37:24,50
SOMEONE<Satin> waves to Sister, then trades a nod with SOMEONE<Stix>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS240
00:37:31,00 --> 00:37:40,50
SOMEONE<Levi> glares in SOMEONE's<Satin's> direction. Sister rejoins SOMEONE<Sparkle> and SOMEONE<Dolores>. The trio performing a provocative dance. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS241
00:37:39,00 --> 00:37:46,50
They cross their wrists over their chest, then freeze with them crossed at an angle overhead. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS242
00:37:45,00 --> 00:37:54,50
Audience members stand. SOMEONE<Satin> takes a flash picture of Sister. Later, SOMEONE<Stix> walks the girls to the car. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS243
00:38:17,00 --> 00:38:22,50
SOMEONE<Levi> shuts the driver's door and pulls out. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS244
00:38:21,00 --> 00:38:27,50
SOMEONE<Stix> throws an air punch. Now in a pool hall. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS245
00:38:28,00 --> 00:38:35,50
His opponent pounds his cue stick on the floor and slams a wad of cash on the table. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS246
00:38:33,00 --> 00:38:38,50
In bed, SOMEONE<Sparkle> writes a song. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS247
00:38:37,00 --> 00:38:42,50
Now Sister and her sisters perform at the club. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS249
00:38:59,00 --> 00:39:08,50
The frustrated opponent throws down his cue and storms out. Watching him go, SOMEONE<Stix> chuckles. At the club. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS251
00:39:16,00 --> 00:39:24,50
Now the club owner crosses the floor and greets the comedian as he and SOMEONE<Ham> arrive on another night. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS253
00:39:24,00 --> 00:39:32,50
Sister and her sisters perform on stage. Dancing in unison, their hair now short. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS254
00:39:29,00 --> 00:39:35,50
Each wearing an identical black, silver, and red mini-dress. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS255
00:39:39,00 --> 00:39:46,50
The sisters throw their hands overhead. They clap their hands, then turn around. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS256
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:59,50
SOMEONE<Satin> takes a flash picture, and now they wear long black and white dresses in complimentary styles. A sign out front reads, Appearing tonight, Sister and Her Sisters, Sold Out. SOMEONE<Stix> and the club owner clink their glasses. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS258
00:40:12,00 --> 00:40:16,50
SOMEONE<Levi> primps his hair. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS259
00:40:13,00 --> 00:40:21,50
Then returns his attention to the performance. Sister stokes her quaffed chin length blonde hair. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS260
00:40:20,00 --> 00:40:27,50
The sisters end on a hop, then stand hand in hand, beaming for the crowd. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS261
00:40:24,00 --> 00:40:30,50
Later in the dressing room, Sister drinks a martini. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS262
00:40:30,00 --> 00:40:35,50
SOMEONE<Stix> gives SOMEONE<Sparkle> a kiss on the cheek. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS263
00:40:42,00 --> 00:40:48,50
SOMEONE<Levi> barges in with a handful of white lilies. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS264
00:40:56,00 --> 00:41:02,50
He tries to give Sister a kiss, but she shies away. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS265
00:41:23,00 --> 00:41:27,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> looks away. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS266
00:41:27,00 --> 00:41:32,50
SOMEONE<Satin> holds her gaze. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS267
00:41:36,00 --> 00:41:41,50
He offers her a ring box. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS268
00:41:41,00 --> 00:41:48,50
As SOMEONE<Levi> glances at his lilies, Sister opens the box to find a diamond ring. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS270
00:41:54,00 --> 00:41:59,50
Watching them tussle, Sister grins. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS271
00:41:57,00 --> 00:42:02,50
With SOMEONE's<Ham's> help, SOMEONE<Stix> drags SOMEONE<Levi> out of the room. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS272
00:42:10,00 --> 00:42:15,50
SOMEONE<Satin> smiles at Sister. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS273
00:42:17,00 --> 00:42:24,50
Sister nods. On his way out, SOMEONE<Satin> glances at SOMEONE<Sparkle>, who looks down. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS274
00:42:22,00 --> 00:42:27,50
Sister sets down the box, and tries on her ring. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS276
00:43:24,00 --> 00:43:33,50
SOMEONE<Levi> tightens his lips. He straightens his cousin's lapels, taps him on the chest, then turns and heads for the door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS277
00:43:31,00 --> 00:43:37,50
With his chin jutting forward, SOMEONE<Levi> turns back. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS279
00:43:43,00 --> 00:43:47,50
Heading off, SOMEONE shrugs, then knocks a box off a stool. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS280
00:43:52,00 --> 00:44:02,50
SOMEONE<Stix> bats a hanging lamp and storms off. Now in the daytime, SOMEONE<Emma> hosts a dinner. Reverend Bryce sits at the head of the table. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS281
00:44:43,00 --> 00:44:49,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> shoots the reverend a look, then shakes her head. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS283
00:45:00,00 --> 00:45:04,50
She pulls her hand back. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS284
00:45:07,00 --> 00:45:12,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> giggles and SOMEONE<Emma> shoots her a look. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS285
00:45:45,00 --> 00:45:50,50
SOMEONE<Emma> stares at them as they take their seats. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS286
00:45:47,00 --> 00:45:52,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> leans in to SOMEONE<Sparkle>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS287
00:46:05,00 --> 00:46:10,50
The reverend scrutinizes SOMEONE<Satin>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS288
00:47:19,00 --> 00:47:23,50
Reverend Bryce looks at SOMEONE<Emma>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS289
00:47:21,00 --> 00:47:29,50
As Tune Ann chomps on a carrot, her mother shoots her a furious look. SOMEONE<Satin> draws a deep breath. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS290
00:48:14,00 --> 00:48:19,50
Holding her daughter's gaze, SOMEONE<Emma> shakes her head. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS291
00:48:31,00 --> 00:48:35,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> lowers her eyes. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS293
00:48:39,00 --> 00:48:44,50
He glances at the others. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS294
00:50:26,00 --> 00:50:31,50
SOMEONE<Emma> meets her daughter's gaze. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS295
00:50:29,00 --> 00:50:34,50
Sister wipes tears from her cheeks. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS296
00:50:32,00 --> 00:50:37,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> glances down. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS297
00:50:42,00 --> 00:50:47,50
SOMEONE<Emma> shakes her head. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS298
00:50:45,00 --> 00:50:50,50
Sister and SOMEONE<Satin> head for the door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS299
00:51:00,00 --> 00:51:05,50
Sister shares a gaze with SOMEONE<Sparkle>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS300
00:51:03,00 --> 00:51:08,50
She glances at the others, then walks out. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS301
00:51:07,00 --> 00:51:11,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> leaves her seat. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS302
00:51:11,00 --> 00:51:17,50
As SOMEONE<Sparkle> follows Sister upstairs, SOMEONE<Emma> touches her temple. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS303
00:51:15,00 --> 00:51:21,50
Now SOMEONE<Sparkle> watches Sister pack her jewelry into a box. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS304
00:51:29,00 --> 00:51:38,50
Sister closes the buckles on her hard case black and white print suitcase, and grabs a second one on her way out. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS305
00:51:35,00 --> 00:51:39,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> slowly approaches. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS306
00:51:41,00 --> 00:51:46,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> eyes dart between her two sisters. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS307
00:51:44,00 --> 00:51:48,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> smiles. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS308
00:51:46,00 --> 00:51:50,50
Sister hugs her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS309
00:51:53,00 --> 00:51:59,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> buries her chin in Sister's shoulder. Sister faces SOMEONE<Sparkle>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS310
00:51:58,00 --> 00:52:01,50
They hug. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS311
00:52:02,00 --> 00:52:08,50
Holding back tears, SOMEONE<Sparkle> separates from Sister. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS312
00:52:06,00 --> 00:52:13,50
With a soft smile, she touches SOMEONE's<Sparkle's> cheek and grabs her suitcases. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS313
00:52:10,00 --> 00:52:17,50
They watch Sister wind halfway down the wooden staircase with a confident strut. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS314
00:52:14,00 --> 00:52:21,50
She glances up at them with a reassuring look, and continues to the bottom. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS315
00:52:18,00 --> 00:52:25,50
Waiting near the front door with a huge smile, SOMEONE<Satin> holds her white fur coat. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS316
00:52:23,00 --> 00:52:28,50
She hands him a suitcase and they continue out the front door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS317
00:52:26,00 --> 00:52:33,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> and SOMEONE<Sparkle> watch from the second floor, as SOMEONE<Emma> steps into the foyer. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS318
00:52:35,00 --> 00:52:42,50
She stares out for a moment toward her oldest daughter, then gently closes the front door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS319
00:52:43,00 --> 00:52:51,50
Turning around, she gazes up at her two remaining daughters, who glare down and promptly retreat into the bedroom. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS320
00:52:53,00 --> 00:53:00,50
Now at night, SOMEONE<Sparkle> mounts SOMEONE's<Stix's> motorcycle, holding him tight. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS321
00:53:01,00 --> 00:53:07,50
SOMEONE<Stix> nods, turns on the headlight and drives away from her house. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS322
00:53:04,00 --> 00:53:09,50
Now the young couple cruises through the night. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS323
00:53:06,00 --> 00:53:13,50
With her eyes closed, SOMEONE<Sparkle> rests her cheek against his brown leather jacket. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS324
00:53:18,00 --> 00:53:26,50
Now at a flat roof mansion, identical glass paneled doors line a lengthy balcony. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS325
00:53:25,00 --> 00:53:32,50
Sister emerges from inside and approaches SOMEONE<Satin> in a white baby doll nightie. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS326
00:53:29,00 --> 00:53:37,50
As he reads a book in a burgundy robe, she serves him coffee and caresses his shoulders. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS327
00:53:42,00 --> 00:53:46,50
She sits on his lap. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS328
00:53:50,00 --> 00:53:54,50
He prepares cocaine. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS329
00:53:54,00 --> 00:53:59,50
Sister eyes the drugs, then smiles. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS330
00:54:00,00 --> 00:54:10,50
SOMEONE<Satin> licks his fingers. Sister kisses him tenderly. As their embrace intensifies, they passionately kiss each other's necks. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS331
00:54:07,00 --> 00:54:14,50
The seductive beauty sinks further into his lap. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS332
00:54:12,00 --> 00:54:19,50
He rubs his hand up her body. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS333
00:54:16,00 --> 00:54:22,50
Now inside SOMEONE's<Satin's> mansion, Sister rubs her nose while smoking a cigarette. A thick head band supports her disheveled hair. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS334
00:54:19,00 --> 00:54:24,50
She steps in front of SOMEONE<Sparkle> and SOMEONE<Dolores>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS336
00:54:57,00 --> 00:55:01,50
SOMEONE<Satin> pours a drink. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS337
00:55:05,00 --> 00:55:10,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> holds in a giggle. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS338
00:55:15,00 --> 00:55:19,50
Her smile fades. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS339
00:55:26,00 --> 00:55:30,50
Sister leads the girls out. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS340
00:55:27,00 --> 00:55:34,50
As SOMEONE<Satin> glares at them, SOMEONE<Sparkle> cowers, but SOMEONE<Dolores> looks him in the eye. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS341
00:55:31,00 --> 00:55:38,50
Now in a dressing room, the girls get ready as Sister arrives. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS342
00:55:58,00 --> 00:56:04,50
Sister removes her hat, revealing a black eye. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS343
00:56:32,00 --> 00:56:39,50
As SOMEONE<Dolores> leaves, Sister opens her compact and lines cocaine on the mirror. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS344
00:56:48,00 --> 00:56:54,50
As Sister leans down, SOMEONE's<Sparkle's> mouth hangs open and her brow furrows. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS345
00:56:52,00 --> 00:56:58,50
The compact's mirror reflects Sister bruised eye. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS346
00:57:00,00 --> 00:57:07,50
Now on the dark stage, Sister lets a wrap with a voluminous high collar, drop to her feet. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS347
00:57:05,00 --> 00:57:11,50
Her sisters remain silhouetted by backdrops of large lit squares. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS348
00:57:09,00 --> 00:57:16,50
The trio moves forward, provocatively swaying their hips with each snap. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS349
00:58:24,00 --> 00:58:30,50
At home in front of the TV, SOMEONE<Emma> snores on the couch holding a teacup. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS350
00:58:28,00 --> 00:58:34,50
She wears a blue nightgown with a hair scarf tied around the curlers in her hair. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS351
00:58:32,00 --> 00:58:38,50
She awakes to her daughters performing, and leans closer. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS352
00:58:35,00 --> 00:58:41,50
On the color TV, a close-up shows SOMEONE’s<Sparkle’s> seductive gaze. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS354
00:59:31,00 --> 00:59:37,50
The ladies pump their fists at their rocking hips. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS355
00:59:41,00 --> 00:59:46,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> winks to SOMEONE<Stix>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS356
01:00:11,00 --> 01:00:16,50
SOMEONE<Stix> watches SOMEONE<Sparkle> beckon him suggestively. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS357
01:00:17,00 --> 01:00:23,50
Off stage, SOMEONE<Satin> touches a cut on his forehead. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS358
01:00:24,00 --> 01:00:31,50
Sister bends at the knees, sensually rubbing her hands down her thighs. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS359
01:00:28,00 --> 01:00:35,50
A white band of sheer fabric down her sides, accentuates her curves. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS360
01:00:32,00 --> 01:00:41,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> and SOMEONE<Dolores> shimmy backwards, silhouetted on either side of Sister as she walks with her back to the audience. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS361
01:00:39,00 --> 01:00:44,50
She gives one more enticing look to the crowd. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS362
01:00:41,00 --> 01:00:47,50
A blue glow consumes her face and her smile fades. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS363
01:00:45,00 --> 01:00:48,50
In the dressing room. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS364
01:01:48,00 --> 01:01:52,50
He points at Sister. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS365
01:01:51,00 --> 01:01:56,50
Sister turns her bruised face away. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS366
01:02:15,00 --> 01:02:20,50
SOMEONE<Satin> enters with SOMEONE<Ham>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS367
01:02:35,00 --> 01:02:40,50
SOMEONE<Stix> leans to SOMEONE<Sparkle>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS368
01:02:48,00 --> 01:02:55,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> watches SOMEONE<Stix> leave with a big smile that fades as she faces SOMEONE<Satin>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS369
01:02:56,00 --> 01:03:03,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> blocks SOMEONE<Satin> and SOMEONE<Sparkle> joins her. They glare at the abusive man. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS370
01:03:04,00 --> 01:03:09,50
Sister stays seated and looks toward them. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS371
01:03:07,00 --> 01:03:12,50
SOMEONE<Satin> sneers at SOMEONE<Dolores>, who holds her ground. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS372
01:03:09,00 --> 01:03:16,50
He slowly turns away, keeping his menacing eyes locked on hers. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS373
01:03:13,00 --> 01:03:21,50
As he and SOMEONE<Ham> leave the dressing room, Sister faces the opposite way and fiddles with her purse. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS374
01:03:29,00 --> 01:03:33,50
Sister looks away. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS375
01:03:36,00 --> 01:03:41,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> gently takes her hand. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS376
01:03:40,00 --> 01:03:44,50
Tilting her head. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS377
01:03:42,00 --> 01:03:46,50
Sister sighs and stands up. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS378
01:03:44,00 --> 01:03:50,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> grabs Sister's white fur coat, and some makeup cases. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS379
01:03:47,00 --> 01:03:53,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> takes Sister by the hand and leads her out of the room. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS380
01:03:50,00 --> 01:04:00,50
In the hallway, audience members mingle backstage. Sister glances across the room to SOMEONE<Satin>, who initiates applause. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS381
01:04:03,00 --> 01:04:14,50
Sister takes the fur coat from SOMEONE<Dolores> and turns toward the party with a glowing smile. Her sisters watch her amble up a few stairs in her black mini-dress. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS382
01:04:11,00 --> 01:04:17,50
SOMEONE<Satin> takes her picture as she hurries into his arms. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS383
01:04:20,00 --> 01:04:27,50
SOMEONE<Satin> glances across the room at SOMEONE<Sparkle> and SOMEONE<Dolores>, as Sister leads him out of sight. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS384
01:04:27,00 --> 01:04:34,50
The two sisters stare with disappointed gazes, then continue on their way out. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS385
01:04:35,00 --> 01:04:41,50
Now at home, a pile of suitcases sit at the foot of the stairs. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS386
01:04:38,00 --> 01:04:43,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> sets her makeup case on top. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS387
01:04:41,00 --> 01:04:48,50
In the living room, SOMEONE<Emma> sits on the couch with her hands in her lap, staring straight ahead. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS388
01:04:45,00 --> 01:04:52,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> and SOMEONE<Dolores> walk timidly toward her in their black overcoats. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS389
01:05:38,00 --> 01:05:43,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> keeps her gaze on the floor. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS390
01:05:45,00 --> 01:05:49,50
SOMEONE<Emma> leans forward. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS391
01:06:27,00 --> 01:06:32,50
She pulls out SOMEONE's<Sparkle's> red song journal. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS392
01:06:34,00 --> 01:06:39,50
She rises from the couch. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS393
01:06:39,00 --> 01:06:46,50
SOMEONE<Emma> stomps to a waste basket in the foyer and tosses it in. SOMEONE<Sparkle> fishes it out. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS394
01:07:24,00 --> 01:07:29,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> gives a little nod. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS395
01:07:26,00 --> 01:07:32,50
SOMEONE<Emma> looks at SOMEONE<Dolores>, then marches up the stairs. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS396
01:07:34,00 --> 01:07:41,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> holds her journal at her side, with one trembling black gloved hand. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS397
01:07:38,00 --> 01:07:43,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> puts a steadying hand on it. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS398
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:54,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> nods tearfully. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS399
01:07:51,00 --> 01:08:00,50
Now on SOMEONE's<Satin's> balcony, Sister wearing a white feather-trimmed robe, holds a drink as she reads a magazine. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS400
01:07:57,00 --> 01:08:02,50
SOMEONE<Satin> comes out smoking a cigarette. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS401
01:08:02,00 --> 01:08:10,50
He snaps a picture of her, then saunters over in his burgundy robe and kisses her on the cheek. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS402
01:08:07,00 --> 01:08:13,50
He sits down at the table and shows her a notebook. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS403
01:08:21,00 --> 01:08:25,50
She flips through notebook. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS404
01:08:35,00 --> 01:08:39,50
She rises. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS405
01:08:38,00 --> 01:08:42,50
She straddles him. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS406
01:08:41,00 --> 01:08:46,50
Putting her arms around him. She kisses him. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS408
01:08:52,00 --> 01:08:58,50
She flexes one long stocking clad leg and gets up. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS409
01:08:55,00 --> 01:09:00,50
She takes the notebook with her into the house. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS410
01:09:03,00 --> 01:09:07,50
She turns around. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS412
01:09:14,00 --> 01:09:19,50
In the packed nightclub, Sister laughs in a booth with SOMEONE<Ham>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS414
01:09:22,00 --> 01:09:29,50
The heckler sits in a booth with his arm around a sexy woman. It's SOMEONE<Levi>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS415
01:09:26,00 --> 01:09:31,50
SOMEONE<Ham> cranes his neck to look at him. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS416
01:09:39,00 --> 01:09:45,50
SOMEONE<Levi> takes a puff on his cigarette. Sister scowls. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS417
01:09:50,00 --> 01:09:55,50
SOMEONE<Satin> moves toward SOMEONE's<Levi's> table. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS418
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:09,50
Sister blinks heavily and lets out a breath. SOMEONE<Ham> looks from SOMEONE<Levi> to SOMEONE<Satin>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS419
01:10:08,00 --> 01:10:13,50
SOMEONE<Satin> throws down his cigarette. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS420
01:10:13,00 --> 01:10:20,50
SOMEONE<Satin> lunges, but a man at SOMEONE's<Levi's> table blocks him. SOMEONE<Ham> holds him back. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS421
01:10:19,00 --> 01:10:24,50
SOMEONE<Levi> makes a scissor gesture. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS422
01:10:28,00 --> 01:10:34,50
She blows smoke in his direction, then leaves. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS423
01:10:31,00 --> 01:10:38,50
Outside in slow motion, SOMEONE<Ham> struggles to hold back a hopping mad SOMEONE<Satin>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS424
01:10:41,00 --> 01:10:49,50
SOMEONE<Satin> finally calms down. Straightens his jacket and throws one last punch in the direction of the club. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS425
01:10:47,00 --> 01:10:57,50
He gets into a sleek silver sports car, parked under the baker's flashing marquee. It reads, "Presenting SOMEONE Struthers, 8:00 PM. " 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS426
01:10:55,00 --> 01:11:00,50
Sister scrambles to the passenger side. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS427
01:10:57,00 --> 01:11:03,50
Pulling her fur stole around her, and tossing her cigarette butt. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS428
01:11:01,00 --> 01:11:06,50
She exhales one last long stream of smoke. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS429
01:11:03,00 --> 01:11:08,50
As SOMEONE<Ham> holds the door open for her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS430
01:11:06,00 --> 01:11:11,50
As the car pulls away, SOMEONE<Ham> watches it go. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS431
01:11:15,00 --> 01:11:22,50
Now in slow motion beyond the windows of SOMEONE's<Satin's> mansion, SOMEONE<Satin> chases Sister. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS432
01:11:19,00 --> 01:11:25,50
In her stocking feet, she slips on the floor and falls. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS434
01:11:24,00 --> 01:11:28,50
He tries to pin her arms behind her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS435
01:11:26,00 --> 01:11:33,50
She wriggles free, and dashes into another room, where she falls face down on a banquette. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS436
01:11:31,00 --> 01:11:38,50
Behind her, SOMEONE<Satin> raises his belt and brings it down hard on her back. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS437
01:11:35,00 --> 01:11:40,50
He beats her again and again. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS438
01:11:40,00 --> 01:11:48,50
Now in a cool blue reception area, SOMEONE<Stix> paces in front of a sign emblazoned with a Colombia logo. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS439
01:11:51,00 --> 01:12:01,50
In slow motion, the elevator doors part, and SOMEONE<Dolores> steps out in a mod purple mini-dress. Her hair styled in a close-cropped Afro. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS440
01:11:58,00 --> 01:12:04,50
A white businessman does a double take as she passes. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS441
01:12:01,00 --> 01:12:09,50
Another white man stares at her, and she glares back as she strides past him and down the hall. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS442
01:12:06,00 --> 01:12:11,50
SOMEONE<Stix> takes her in as she walks up to him. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS443
01:12:34,00 --> 01:12:39,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> catches SOMEONE<Sparkle> staring. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS444
01:12:50,00 --> 01:12:59,50
In a utility closet, Sister smooth's down her dress and looks at her battered reflection in a metal paper towel dispenser. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS445
01:12:56,00 --> 01:13:01,50
She fiddles with her tangled hair. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS446
01:12:58,00 --> 01:13:03,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> enters, followed by SOMEONE<Dolores>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS447
01:13:11,00 --> 01:13:16,50
She looks at needle marks in Sister's arm. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS448
01:13:52,00 --> 01:13:58,50
In their struggle, a glass vile breaks on the floor. Outside the door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS449
01:14:06,00 --> 01:14:10,50
SOMEONE<Larry> raps on the door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS450
01:14:09,00 --> 01:14:19,50
His blonde receptionist unlocks the door. In the closet on the floor, SOMEONE<Dolores> and SOMEONE<Sparkle> huddle around Sister, who shakes back her tangled hair. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS451
01:14:21,00 --> 01:14:26,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> looks up to find SOMEONE<Larry> gone. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS452
01:14:24,00 --> 01:14:29,50
SOMEONE<Stix> leans against the door jam and hangs his head. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS453
01:14:26,00 --> 01:14:31,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> casts her eyes down. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS454
01:14:32,00 --> 01:14:39,50
Now rain falls as SOMEONE<Sparkle> raises her bedroom window and props it open with a red book. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS455
01:14:36,00 --> 01:14:42,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Stix> motions for her to join him. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS456
01:14:39,00 --> 01:14:44,50
She rises from the window. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS457
01:14:41,00 --> 01:14:46,50
SOMEONE, his cap and jacket soaked 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS458
01:14:43,00 --> 01:14:48,50
walks around the house, and waits by the backdoor. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS459
01:14:46,00 --> 01:14:53,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> clutches a thin SOMEONEy<satiny> robe around her and steps outside to join him. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS460
01:14:51,00 --> 01:14:55,50
They huddle in the doorway. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS461
01:15:51,00 --> 01:15:56,50
He nods his head several times. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS462
01:16:17,00 --> 01:16:22,50
She looks down and shakes her head. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS463
01:16:24,00 --> 01:16:29,50
He turns and walks down her driveway in the rain. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS464
01:16:29,00 --> 01:16:35,50
SOMEONE hesitates,  

SPARKLE_2012_DVS465
01:16:35,00 --> 01:16:39,50
then turns back and enters the house. She slowly walks up the stairs. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS466
01:16:39,00 --> 01:16:48,50
Now at SOMEONE's, SOMEONE lugs a suitcase while sister sits on the banquette twirling her hair in a daze. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS467
01:16:45,00 --> 01:16:51,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> in a bright yellow turtleneck, shouts up to SOMEONE<Sparkle>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS468
01:17:02,00 --> 01:17:06,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> takes her drink. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS469
01:17:03,00 --> 01:17:09,50
As Sister swings at her, SOMEONE<Dolores> yanks her off the banquette. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS470
01:17:08,00 --> 01:17:12,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> rushes in. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS471
01:17:18,00 --> 01:17:24,50
SOMEONE<Satin> approaches, a suitcase in each hand. The sisters separate. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS472
01:17:27,00 --> 01:17:32,50
He puts down his luggage and gives Sister a little smile. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS473
01:17:37,00 --> 01:17:42,50
She walks over to the banquette and sits down. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS474
01:17:39,00 --> 01:17:44,50
SOMEONE<Satin> turns to SOMEONE<Sparkle> and SOMEONE<Dolores>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS476
01:18:00,00 --> 01:18:04,50
He points his finger at her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS477
01:18:03,00 --> 01:18:08,50
Sister gets up and lunges at him. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS478
01:18:08,00 --> 01:18:14,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> attacks him. With one hand, he shoves Sister to the 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS479
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:16,50
Banquette, then wrestles SOMEONE<Dolores> off of him. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS480
01:18:17,00 --> 01:18:26,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> leaps on his back. SOMEONE<Dolores> grabs a poker from the fireplace. He throws SOMEONE<Sparkle> to the ground and looms over her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS481
01:18:27,00 --> 01:18:32,50
From behind, SOMEONE<Dolores> swings the poker at his head. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS482
01:18:30,00 --> 01:18:34,50
He falls face down on the carpet. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS483
01:18:32,00 --> 01:18:38,50
With his mouth open, he exhales a long breath and a short gasp. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS484
01:18:35,00 --> 01:18:42,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> stands over him, gripping the poker in both hands. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS485
01:18:39,00 --> 01:18:43,50
Sister stares in shock. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS486
01:18:40,00 --> 01:18:45,50
SOMEONE's<Sparkle's> mouth hangs open. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS487
01:18:48,00 --> 01:18:55,50
Sister looks from SOMEONE<Satin> to SOMEONE<Dolores>. Then gets up and goes to her side. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS488
01:18:52,00 --> 01:18:57,50
She takes the poker in her hands. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS489
01:19:02,00 --> 01:19:07,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> kneels over SOMEONE<Satin> and rolls him face up. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS490
01:19:07,00 --> 01:19:11,50
She starts CPR. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS491
01:19:12,00 --> 01:19:18,50
She wipes her nose. Sister lays down the poker. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS492
01:19:15,00 --> 01:19:20,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> blows air into SOMEONE's<Satin's> mouth. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS493
01:19:17,00 --> 01:19:23,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> watches SOMEONE<Dolores> try to revive him. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS494
01:19:20,00 --> 01:19:25,50
Sister approaches and kneels beside SOMEONE<Dolores>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS495
01:20:01,00 --> 01:20:07,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> gets to her feet, then pulls SOMEONE<Sparkle> off the floor. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS496
01:20:05,00 --> 01:20:12,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> pushes her out of the room. Sister sobs and beats on the dead man's chest. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS498
01:20:21,00 --> 01:20:26,50
She caresses his lifeless face. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS499
01:20:49,00 --> 01:20:56,50
We fade to a black and white snapshot of Sister she holds in her hands. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS500
01:20:53,00 --> 01:20:58,50
Now at night, she smokes on the banquette. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS501
01:20:57,00 --> 01:21:07,50
Outside, two uniformed men carry a body-bag from the house, past policemen and parked patrol cars with flashing blue lights. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS502
01:21:05,00 --> 01:21:12,50
A heavy-set man with glasses leads Sister from the house in a long black coat. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS503
01:21:10,00 --> 01:21:14,50
Hands cuffed behind her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS504
01:21:11,00 --> 01:21:19,50
She glances at the body-bag, as he guides her into the backseat of a patrol car and closes the door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS505
01:21:25,00 --> 01:21:32,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> rests her head across her arm, as she lies face down on her bed. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS506
01:21:30,00 --> 01:21:36,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> comes and lies beside her sister, looking into her face. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS507
01:21:34,00 --> 01:21:40,50
She wipes a tear running down the bridge of SOMEONE's<Sparkle's> nose. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS508
01:21:37,00 --> 01:21:43,50
Then turns and rests her head on her own crossed arms. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS509
01:21:50,00 --> 01:21:56,50
As Sister poses for mugshots, a newspaper headline reads. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS510
01:21:53,00 --> 01:22:01,50
"Negro comedian slain. Fiancé pleads self-defense. Bail denied pending trial. " 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS511
01:22:11,00 --> 01:22:16,50
SOMEONE<Emma> sings, smiling through tears. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS512
01:22:44,00 --> 01:22:49,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> sits in a church pew. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS513
01:22:59,00 --> 01:23:05,50
SOMEONE<Emma> opens her arms before the packed church. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS515
01:25:03,00 --> 01:25:13,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> sits at the kitchen table. Luggage rests at the bottom of the stairs. SOMEONE<Emma> and SOMEONE<Sparkle> arrive home, and SOMEONE<Dolores> rises to meet them. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS516
01:25:12,00 --> 01:25:16,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> hugs her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS517
01:25:17,00 --> 01:25:23,50
As SOMEONE<Sparkle> steps away, SOMEONE<Emma> eyes the luggage. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS518
01:25:30,00 --> 01:25:34,50
SOMEONE's<Emma's> jaw drops. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS520
01:25:55,00 --> 01:25:59,50
SOMEONE<Emma> blinks back tears. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS521
01:26:37,00 --> 01:26:40,50
They hug. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS522
01:26:45,00 --> 01:26:54,50
Now SOMEONE<Sparkle> watches from her bedroom window, as SOMEONE<Dolores> walks to a waiting taxi, and hands her bags to the driver. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS523
01:26:52,00 --> 01:26:57,50
She gets in the backseat and closes the door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS524
01:26:54,00 --> 01:26:58,50
As the cab pulls away. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS525
01:26:56,00 --> 01:27:00,50
SOMEONE<Dolores> looks back at the house. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS526
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:04,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> waves, then rests her head on the window pane. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS527
01:27:01,00 --> 01:27:08,50
Now in prison, SOMEONE<Sparkle> looks at Sister through a pane of glass. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS528
01:27:05,00 --> 01:27:09,50
Each of them holding a phone receiver. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS529
01:27:29,00 --> 01:27:33,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> blinks and looks down. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS530
01:27:43,00 --> 01:27:48,50
Tears come to Sister's eyes. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS531
01:27:45,00 --> 01:27:49,50
She shakes her head. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS532
01:28:26,00 --> 01:28:33,50
Sister stares into SOMEONE's<Sparkle's> eyes. Then hangs up the phone. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS533
01:28:33,00 --> 01:28:39,50
Sister keeps walking and disappears behind a door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS534
01:28:36,00 --> 01:28:41,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> sighs and hangs up the phone. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS535
01:28:41,00 --> 01:28:48,50
Now her hair in pigtails, Nancy Sinatra sings on a sound stage. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS536
01:28:56,00 --> 01:29:03,50
At home, SOMEONE<Sparkle> watches TV. In a housecoat and curlers, SOMEONE<Emma> turns off the set. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS537
01:29:05,00 --> 01:29:10,50
SOMEONE<Emma> walks away. SOMEONE<Sparkle> sighs. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS539
01:29:08,00 --> 01:29:15,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> looks over an empty apartment, as a white man stands at the open door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS540
01:29:15,00 --> 01:29:20,50
She crosses to a window and looks outside. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS541
01:29:22,00 --> 01:29:28,50
At night with the room fully furnished, SOMEONE<Sparkle> unpacks. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS542
01:29:25,00 --> 01:29:32,50
Sitting on her bed by an open cardboard box, she flips through the pages of her song journal. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS543
01:29:39,00 --> 01:29:44,50
She smiles to herself and turns the page, stopping. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS544
01:29:41,00 --> 01:29:48,50
An underlying song title at the top of a page reads, One Wing. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS545
01:29:52,00 --> 01:30:00,50
At night alone at home, SOMEONE<Emma> smokes a cigarette on her couch. At her apartment, SOMEONE<Sparkle> writes in her songbook. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS546
01:30:02,00 --> 01:30:12,50
In the daytime, SOMEONE<Sparkle> enters a marbled floor lobby through a set of revolving doors. She speaks with a guard sitting within a circular counter. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS547
01:30:18,00 --> 01:30:23,50
She nods and heads down a hall. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS548
01:30:20,00 --> 01:30:25,50
Now on another floor, she exits the elevator. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS549
01:30:23,00 --> 01:30:30,50
Arriving at Columbia Records, she crosses to the desk of the blonde haired receptionist. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS550
01:30:43,00 --> 01:30:50,50
The receptionist watches SOMEONE<Sparkle> take a seat on a long bench across the reception area. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS551
01:30:48,00 --> 01:30:54,50
The patient young woman holds her purse over her lap, wearing a leather jacket. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS552
01:30:51,00 --> 01:30:59,50
On another day, now wearing a pink dress, SOMEONE<Sparkle> watches a businessman head off for a meeting. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS553
01:30:57,00 --> 01:31:03,50
Now wearing a checkered outfit, she notices another businessman on his way out. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS554
01:31:01,00 --> 01:31:08,50
Wearing an outfit with yellow sleeves, she eats a sandwich, kicking her leg out of boredom. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS555
01:31:06,00 --> 01:31:12,50
In a striped dress, she sleeps clutching a magazine. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS556
01:31:09,00 --> 01:31:18,50
A receptionist wakes her and she smiles. Leaving the magazine behind, she follows the receptionist through a door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS557
01:31:19,00 --> 01:31:32,50
The receptionist leads SOMEONE down a hall and into SOMEONE's office. The goateed executive talks on the phone, sitting at his desk before a wall of tall windows overlooking a river. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS558
01:31:32,00 --> 01:31:38,50
As SOMEONE<Sparkle> takes a look around, the door swings shut behind her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS559
01:31:38,00 --> 01:31:44,50
She approaches the desk, and the busy executive glances at her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS560
01:31:49,00 --> 01:31:53,50
He hangs up the phone. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS561
01:32:00,00 --> 01:32:03,50
She takes a seat. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS562
01:32:39,00 --> 01:32:43,50
SOMEONE<Robinson> holds her gaze. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS563
01:32:41,00 --> 01:32:54,50
Later with her arms folded, SOMEONE<Sparkle> paces in the lobby of an apartment building. SOMEONE<Stix> comes downstairs, and a cigar smoking building manager directs his attention to the visitor. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS564
01:32:55,00 --> 01:33:00,50
SOMEONE<Stix> crosses the lobby and faces SOMEONE<Sparkle>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS565
01:33:17,00 --> 01:33:21,50
SOMEONE<Stix> cracks a smile. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS566
01:33:22,00 --> 01:33:26,50
She smiles and they hug. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS567
01:33:30,00 --> 01:33:36,50
Now at night, SOMEONE<Sparkle> knocks on her mother's front door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS568
01:33:33,00 --> 01:33:39,50
Through the paned panel, she can see SOMEONE<Emma> approach. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS569
01:33:36,00 --> 01:33:40,50
SOMEONE<Emma> opens the door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS570
01:33:52,00 --> 01:33:59,50
Averting her cold gaze, SOMEONE<Emma> gives a careless gesture and steps away from the open door. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS571
01:33:59,00 --> 01:34:05,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> enters timidly, and follows her mother into the living room. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS572
01:34:05,00 --> 01:34:11,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Waters> sits on the couch with SOMEONE<Emma>, who focuses on a TV show. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS573
01:34:09,00 --> 01:34:13,50
The plump woman removes her glasses. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS574
01:34:24,00 --> 01:34:32,50
SOMEONE's<Sparkle's> smile fades, as she notices her mother's haughty gaze fixed stubbornly on the TV. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS575
01:34:33,00 --> 01:34:39,50
She takes it out of her purse, unfolds it and shows it to the women. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS576
01:34:36,00 --> 01:34:40,50
SOMEONE<Emma> ignores it. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS577
01:34:37,00 --> 01:34:45,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> sets it down before her on a coffee table. And Mrs. SOMEONE<Waters> leans over it. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS578
01:34:49,00 --> 01:34:54,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> shifts her gaze, then looks to her mother. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS579
01:34:57,00 --> 01:35:02,50
Ignoring her, SOMEONE<Emma> points mirthfully at the TV. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS580
01:35:00,00 --> 01:35:04,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> shifts on her feet. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS581
01:35:04,00 --> 01:35:13,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Waters> glares reproachfully at SOMEONE<Emma>, who stares ahead with an uncaring expression as her daughter leaves the house. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS582
01:35:15,00 --> 01:35:22,50
Now on a concert hall stage, SOMEONE<Stix> oversees three backup singers. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS583
01:35:23,00 --> 01:35:31,50
Seated at a grand piano, SOMEONE<Sparkle> glances over, then turns her attention to her song journal. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS584
01:35:43,00 --> 01:35:48,50
SOMEONE<Stix> ambles across the stage toward her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS585
01:35:55,00 --> 01:35:59,50
She shuts her song journal. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS586
01:35:56,00 --> 01:36:00,50
SOMEONE<Stix> sits beside her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS587
01:36:04,00 --> 01:36:08,50
SOMEONE<Stix> tilts his head tenderly. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS588
01:36:13,00 --> 01:36:19,50
She folds her arms across her chest and sullenly obeys. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS589
01:36:16,00 --> 01:36:20,50
SOMEONE<Stix> regards her. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS590
01:36:20,00 --> 01:36:25,50
Keeping them shut, she plays the piano. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS591
01:36:39,00 --> 01:36:43,50
She smiles at SOMEONE<Stix>. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS592
01:37:08,00 --> 01:37:12,50
SOMEONE<Stix> steps away. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS593
01:37:34,00 --> 01:37:39,50
As she plays on with her eyes closed. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS594
01:37:37,00 --> 01:37:42,50
SOMEONE<Stix> steps out from the wings with a plate. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS595
01:37:40,00 --> 01:37:47,50
It bears a single serving cake with white frosting, lit with one candle. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS596
01:38:04,00 --> 01:38:11,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> takes a nervous breath, then blows out the candle and smiles. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS597
01:38:24,00 --> 01:38:30,50
SOMEONE<Stix> presents her with a candy ring set in a tasteful jewelry box. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS598
01:38:31,00 --> 01:38:35,50
He beams and holds it out. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS599
01:38:32,00 --> 01:38:38,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> accepts the candy ring, and grins down at it. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS600
01:39:01,00 --> 01:39:06,50
He scoots in closer on the piano bench. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS601
01:39:04,00 --> 01:39:09,50
As SOMEONE<Sparkle> faces SOMEONE<Stix>. He beckons her closer. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS602
01:39:06,00 --> 01:39:10,50
He cradles her face in his hands, and tenderly kisses her lips. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS604
01:39:11,00 --> 01:39:17,50
Pulling back, he gazes solemnly into her eyes. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS605
01:39:24,00 --> 01:39:30,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> takes a deep breath, then relaxes and leans closer. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS606
01:39:30,00 --> 01:39:34,50
She gives SOMEONE<Stix> a hug. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS607
01:39:32,00 --> 01:39:36,50
Then rests her cheek against his shoulder. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS608
01:39:35,00 --> 01:39:42,50
Now in prison, a female guard escorts Sister into a visiting area. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS609
01:39:39,00 --> 01:39:47,50
Clad in a pale pink jumpsuit, she wears her un-styled curly hair in a low ponytail. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS610
01:39:44,00 --> 01:39:49,50
And moves with a weary shuffling gait. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS611
01:39:47,00 --> 01:39:52,50
On the other side of a glass barrier. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS612
01:39:49,00 --> 01:39:54,50
SOMEONE<Emma> sits wearing oversized sunglasses. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS613
01:39:52,00 --> 01:39:57,50
Sister takes the seat facing hers and slumps. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS614
01:39:54,00 --> 01:40:01,50
SOMEONE<Emma> removes her sunglasses and faces her daughter with puffy eyes. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS616
01:39:59,00 --> 01:40:04,50
Tilting her head, she gives a gentle gaze. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS617
01:40:01,00 --> 01:40:09,50
Her daughter regards her gravely, then picks up the telephone handset on her side of the glass. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS618
01:40:06,00 --> 01:40:11,50
SOMEONE<Emma> does the same, and waits patiently. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS619
01:40:13,00 --> 01:40:20,50
The mother shuts her eyes, lifts her brow, and gives a sad smile. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS620
01:40:19,00 --> 01:40:25,50
Leaning close to the glass, Sister smiles softly. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS621
01:40:24,00 --> 01:40:29,50
Her eyes glisten, and she gives an appreciative nod. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS622
01:40:28,00 --> 01:40:33,50
In a dressing room, SOMEONE<Sparkle> wears a blue gown. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS623
01:40:33,00 --> 01:40:37,50
Her backup singers beam. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS624
01:40:39,00 --> 01:40:45,50
Tune Ann brings SOMEONE<Sparkle> a tissue for her nosebleed. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS625
01:40:55,00 --> 01:40:59,50
SOMEONE<Emma> arrives with a dress. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS626
01:41:04,00 --> 01:41:09,50
The backup singers leave the room. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS627
01:41:07,00 --> 01:41:13,50
As SOMEONE<Sparkle> stares, her mother cocks her head and lifts her brow. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS629
01:41:49,00 --> 01:41:56,50
In the dressing room, SOMEONE<Sparkle> wears a slinky crimson gown with a plunging neckline. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS630
01:42:46,00 --> 01:42:51,50
SOMEONE<Emma> gently taps her on the chin, and turns away. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS631
01:43:08,00 --> 01:43:12,50
Beaming, her mother leaves. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS632
01:43:10,00 --> 01:43:18,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> lays her hands over her heart, then faces a full-length mirror and takes in her own striking reflection. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS635
01:43:30,00 --> 01:43:36,50
Now on stage, she adjusts her microphone and faces the house. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS636
01:43:33,00 --> 01:43:38,50
Turning, she looks to SOMEONE<Stix> in the wings. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS637
01:43:35,00 --> 01:43:40,50
He gives her a confident nod. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS638
01:43:39,00 --> 01:43:45,50
SOMEONE's<Sparkle's> hands falter over the piano keys. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS639
01:43:46,00 --> 01:43:53,50
Facing the house, she finds her mother giving an encouraging smile. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS640
01:43:55,00 --> 01:44:01,50
An orchestra plays in a pit below the stage. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS641
01:44:35,00 --> 01:44:40,50
Lights come up on her backup singers. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS642
01:45:38,00 --> 01:45:45,50
A partition rises, revealing a gospel choir of singers dressed in white robes. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS643
01:46:14,00 --> 01:46:22,50
In the wings, SOMEONE shifts his weight beside SOMEONE, who watches with crossed arms. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS644
01:46:23,00 --> 01:46:28,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> rises from the piano. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS645
01:46:51,00 --> 01:46:56,50
She stands at a microphone. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS646
01:47:58,00 --> 01:48:04,50
The audience gives her a standing ovation. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS649
01:48:22,00 --> 01:48:29,50
On stage, SOMEONE<Sparkle> smiles at SOMEONE<Stix>. He blows her a kiss. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS650
01:48:26,00 --> 01:48:34,50
Beaming joyfully, the young singer songwriter faces the cheering audience. 

SPARKLE_2012_DVS651
01:48:31,00 --> 01:48:38,50
SOMEONE<Sparkle> leans her head back, spreads her arms and drinks in the applause.
