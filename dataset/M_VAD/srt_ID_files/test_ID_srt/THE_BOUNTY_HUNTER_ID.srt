THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS23
00:02:45,00 --> 00:02:51,50
SOMEONE<Milo> jogs after the hurrying stilt-walker. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS25
00:03:14,00 --> 00:03:25,50
Still in his Uncle SOMEONE<Sam> jacket and beard, the young man races across a building's roof. He halts at its edge and eyes a police van below. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS26
00:03:22,00 --> 00:03:44,50
At ground level, SOMEONE<Milo> sprints past the burning parade float. On the roof the young man scampers one way then races back the other way with SOMEONE<Milo> on his tail. The rugged man chases his target to the roof's edge where the young man leaps off. SOMEONE<Milo> follows. They land on the police van, then hit the ground hard. Police surround them. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS27
00:03:50,00 --> 00:03:55,50
SOMEONE<Milo> hands an officer his badge and ID. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS28
00:03:59,00 --> 00:04:04,50
SOMEONE<Milo> gingerly gets to his feet. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS29
00:04:03,00 --> 00:04:08,50
SOMEONE<Milo> grabs the young man and cuffs him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS30
00:04:22,00 --> 00:04:36,50
The officer cuffs SOMEONE<Milo>. Now, SOMEONE<Nicole> steps off an elevator - phone in hand - and strides past a reception desk. Golden letters behind it read, Daily News.  She passes a colleague. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS31
00:04:41,00 --> 00:04:46,50
SOMEONE<Gary> eyes SOMEONE's<Nicole's> rear. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS32
00:04:44,00 --> 00:04:55,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> enters a newsroom. As she heads to her desk, a mustached man watches her shapely bottom. SOMEONE<Nicole> finds a print-out of her mugshot taped to her computer. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS33
00:04:57,00 --> 00:05:04,50
A sticky-note reads, Don't forget court tomorrow. Mr. Ed. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS34
00:05:02,00 --> 00:05:06,50
The mustached man sits by her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS35
00:06:03,00 --> 00:06:11,50
Meanwhile, police officers mingle at a bar. The bartender answers the phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS36
00:06:27,00 --> 00:06:32,50
SOMEONE<Jimmy> jots on a coaster. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS37
00:06:42,00 --> 00:06:47,50
In a stall, SOMEONE<Nicole> hangs up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS38
00:06:45,00 --> 00:06:49,50
She claps her feet together. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS39
00:06:47,00 --> 00:06:53,50
As she bursts out of the stall, SOMEONE<Stewart> exits a different one. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS40
00:07:14,00 --> 00:07:20,50
She leaves. SOMEONE<Stewart> grins at the mirror. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS41
00:07:20,00 --> 00:07:28,50
He plucks a tissue from a box. Later, SOMEONE<Nicole> strolls across the roof of an apartment building. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS42
00:07:25,00 --> 00:07:33,50
Reaching a corner, she leans on a railing and peers over the edge. She shakes her head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS43
00:07:33,00 --> 00:07:40,50
She takes her phone from her bag and answers it as she returns to the roof's corner. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS44
00:07:57,00 --> 00:08:01,50
At a spa, SOMEONE talks on phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS46
00:08:39,00 --> 00:08:46,50
Nighttime at a police station, a man in a sport coat approaches a jail cell. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS47
00:08:45,00 --> 00:08:55,50
He shows a badge on his belt. An officer releases SOMEONE<Milo> from the cell. Now, SOMEONE<Milo> and his police friend eat at a diner. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS48
00:09:22,00 --> 00:09:29,50
As SOMEONE<Milo> chomps into a taco doused with hot sauce, his friend swigs a coke. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS49
00:09:31,00 --> 00:09:36,50
SOMEONE<Milo> drops his taco on his plate. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS50
00:09:50,00 --> 00:09:56,50
Now at a courthouse, a man uses his phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS51
00:09:58,00 --> 00:10:02,50
A cab pulls up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS52
00:10:24,00 --> 00:10:28,50
She answers her phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS53
00:10:49,00 --> 00:10:52,50
He hangs up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS55
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:19,50
the judge follows SOMEONE's<Arthur's> gaze to the closed double-doors. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS56
00:11:31,00 --> 00:11:37,50
Meanwhile, in the parking lot of a Dunkin' Donuts and a Baskin Robbins plaza, 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS57
00:11:35,00 --> 00:11:44,50
SOMEONE<Jimmy> sits in his car, nervously tapping his steering wheel. He glances over his shoulder and blows out an impatient breath. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS58
00:11:42,00 --> 00:11:48,50
A man smashes his window with a crowbar. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS60
00:11:47,00 --> 00:11:52,50
He pulls SOMEONE<Jimmy> out of his car. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS61
00:11:50,00 --> 00:11:55,50
He shoves him into an SUV. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS62
00:11:53,00 --> 00:12:04,50
As he slams the door, a cab pulls into the parking lot. SOMEONE<Nicole> climbs out and sees the chiseled stranger speeding away in his black SUV. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS63
00:12:02,00 --> 00:12:12,50
She frowns. Now, in another neighborhood a portly man exits the front door of a house with an adjoining storefront. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS64
00:12:18,00 --> 00:12:40,50
He opens a gate. As he follows the sidewalk, he roots around in the pocket of his cargo shorts and pulls out a set of keys. Stopping at the storefront's glass door, he unlocks it and heads inside. A sign on the window reads, Sid's Bail Bonds. The portly man flips on the lights and finds SOMEONE<Milo> asleep, sprawled across a leather loveseat. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS65
00:12:42,00 --> 00:12:47,50
SOMEONE<Milo> groggily opens his eyes. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS66
00:12:48,00 --> 00:12:52,50
SOMEONE<Milo> sits up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS67
00:12:57,00 --> 00:13:02,50
Later, SOMEONE<Sid> packs his station wagon. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS68
00:13:42,00 --> 00:13:46,50
He reaches for his pocket. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS69
00:13:45,00 --> 00:13:53,50
He hands SOMEONE<Milo> a folded piece of paper. The bounty hunter opens it and finds SOMEONE's<Nicole's> mugshot. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS70
00:13:50,00 --> 00:13:55,50
He meets SOMEONE's<Sid's> gaze. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS71
00:13:54,00 --> 00:13:58,50
SOMEONE<Milo> grins. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS72
00:14:22,00 --> 00:14:27,50
SOMEONE<Milo> does a dance. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS73
00:14:28,00 --> 00:14:32,50
He hugs SOMEONE<Sid>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS74
00:14:30,00 --> 00:14:35,50
He kisses him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS75
00:14:37,00 --> 00:14:45,50
SOMEONE<Milo> takes the check from SOMEONE's<Sid's> red-headed assistant and gives her a long, deep kiss. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS76
00:14:47,00 --> 00:14:53,50
SOMEONE<Milo> takes it from his mouth and puts it in hers. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS77
00:15:04,00 --> 00:15:17,50
Now at his place, a freshly showered SOMEONE<Milo> grins at his reflection in a bathroom mirror as he brushes his teeth. Later, he packs a Taser and two guns into a bag. He heads outside. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS78
00:15:22,00 --> 00:15:27,50
Now, he rings SOMEONE's<Nicole's> bell. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS79
00:15:31,00 --> 00:15:36,50
He jiggles the locked door. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS80
00:15:40,00 --> 00:15:51,50
SOMEONE<Milo> scales a wall and lands in a muddy flowerbed. Tracking footprints, he enters SOMEONE's<Nicole's> apartment through a back door and eyes her tasteful decor. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS81
00:15:53,00 --> 00:16:20,50
As he strolls into the spacious living room, SOMEONE<Milo> notices his muddy footprints on a light rug. With a grin, he steps to the side dragging his foot and tracking a long smear. In the bathroom, he drops SOMEONE's<Nicole's> toothbrush in the toilet, then places it back in its holder. In the bedroom, he lounges on SOMEONE's<Nicole's> bed - his muddy shoes on her duvet. He snacks on a pile of nacho cheese Doritos, spilled conveniently within reach. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS82
00:16:17,00 --> 00:16:36,50
SOMEONE<Milo> deletes saved episodes of Weeds and 30 Rock from SOMEONE's<Nicole's> TiVo. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Nicole> keys into a clean white front door. As she enters, SOMEONE<Milo> freezes on the bed and glances toward the hall. Chewing Doritos, he tosses down the remote and wipes his mouth and hands on a pillow. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS83
00:16:34,00 --> 00:16:43,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> searches a small pink-tiled bathroom. SOMEONE<Milo> draws his gun and creeps into the hall. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS84
00:16:41,00 --> 00:16:46,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> peers around a corner. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS85
00:16:43,00 --> 00:16:48,50
SOMEONE<Milo> skulks down the stairs. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS86
00:16:47,00 --> 00:16:56,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> defensively grabs a picture frame and presses her back to a wall by a white-trim doorway. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS87
00:16:56,00 --> 00:17:05,50
As she turns the corner, SOMEONE<Milo> reaches the white door frame at the bottom of the stairs. They both turn the corner. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS88
00:17:04,00 --> 00:17:08,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> scares a cat. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS89
00:17:06,00 --> 00:17:13,50
SOMEONE<Milo> aims his gun at SOMEONE<Stewart>. SOMEONE's<Nicole's> at a completely different address. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS90
00:17:10,00 --> 00:17:15,50
Back at her place, 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS91
00:17:18,00 --> 00:17:22,50
SOMEONE<Milo> aims at SOMEONE<Stewart>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS92
00:17:36,00 --> 00:17:40,50
SOMEONE<Milo> cocks his head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS94
00:17:52,00 --> 00:17:57,50
the cat hides under a chair. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS95
00:18:27,00 --> 00:18:31,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> frowns. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS97
00:18:56,00 --> 00:19:01,50
he swigs juice from a carton. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS98
00:19:11,00 --> 00:19:15,50
SOMEONE<Milo> smiles. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS99
00:19:17,00 --> 00:19:21,50
SOMEONE's<Milo's> grin vanishes. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS100
00:19:51,00 --> 00:19:56,50
SOMEONE<Milo> grabs the phone and hits redial. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS101
00:20:02,00 --> 00:20:06,50
He hits the disconnect button. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS102
00:20:06,00 --> 00:20:22,50
Now, in SOMEONE's<Jimmy's> pink-tiled bathroom, SOMEONE<Nicole> searches a vanity then picks through dirty laundry strewn around the tub. She finds a bar coaster in a pair of jeans. A note on the back reads, Audit Evidence Depository. Missing shit. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS103
00:20:21,00 --> 00:20:27,50
Now, on her cell, she crosses the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS104
00:20:33,00 --> 00:20:38,50
SOMEONE<Bobby> exits an evidence locker while on his cell. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS105
00:21:03,00 --> 00:21:14,50
Now, SOMEONE<Milo> leaves SOMEONE's<Nicole's> building. As he gets into his car, SOMEONE<Stewart> creeps outside and scurries over to a red MINI Cooper. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS106
00:21:11,00 --> 00:21:22,50
Now, a bird's-eye view shows SOMEONE's<Milo's> car exiting a tunnel and approaching a toll plaza. Later, the baby blue ragtop crosses the bridge. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS107
00:21:19,00 --> 00:21:31,50
Later still, it drives beneath an overpass sign reading, Welcome to Atlantic City. A billboard, featuring SOMEONE's<Nicole's> mother, reads, Kitty Borgata. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS108
00:21:28,00 --> 00:21:39,50
Now, we glimpse lavish buildings housing Atlantic City's hotel casinos. In a lounge, Kitty stands in the spotlight on a stage. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS109
00:21:47,00 --> 00:21:52,50
SOMEONE<Milo> enters and smiles. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS110
00:21:53,00 --> 00:21:59,50
Shading her eyes, Kitty peers out at him, he waves. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS111
00:22:03,00 --> 00:22:07,50
She slaps him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS112
00:22:12,00 --> 00:22:18,50
Kitty gives him a big hug. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS113
00:22:37,00 --> 00:22:42,50
she slips off her pumps. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS114
00:23:03,00 --> 00:23:07,50
SOMEONE<Milo> brightens. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS115
00:23:10,00 --> 00:23:34,50
At a racetrack, people crowd the stands. An older woman rubs sunblock on her bare arms. A young woman in a flowered hat eyes her tickets. Jockeys ride their horses toward the starting gate. The race begins and the animals burst onto the track. Two young women cheer. Sitting alone on a long bench, SOMEONE<Nicole> thoughtfully pieces through her collective notes, which include the coaster. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS116
00:23:33,00 --> 00:23:38,50
She digs her cell from her purse and answers. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS117
00:23:42,00 --> 00:23:47,50
Standing near a corral, SOMEONE<Stewart> grins. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS118
00:23:52,00 --> 00:23:57,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> finds SOMEONE<Milo> sharing her bench. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS119
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:06,50
He affects a nonchalant shake of the head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS120
00:24:12,00 --> 00:24:18,50
SOMEONE's<Nicole's> brow nits distrustfully. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS121
00:24:23,00 --> 00:24:31,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> looks away, shifting her wary gaze then frowns at him again. He smirks. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS122
00:24:30,00 --> 00:24:35,50
Standing, he steps before her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS123
00:24:34,00 --> 00:24:39,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> smiles and shakes her head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS124
00:24:42,00 --> 00:24:46,50
She starts to go. His leg blocks her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS126
00:26:10,00 --> 00:26:16,50
A race starts and SOMEONE<Nicole> runs too. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS127
00:26:13,00 --> 00:26:18,50
She hurries up an aisle. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS128
00:26:16,00 --> 00:26:20,50
The horses race down the track. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS129
00:26:22,00 --> 00:26:28,50
SOMEONE<Milo> rubs his hands together, inhales through them, and dashes off. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS130
00:26:25,00 --> 00:26:35,50
As SOMEONE<Nicole> trots through a picnic area, SOMEONE<Milo> sprints through a lobby. Emerging outside, SOMEONE<Nicole> finds him blocking her path. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS131
00:26:37,00 --> 00:26:50,50
She runs off the other way. We glimpse the racing horses' legs, SOMEONE's<Nicole's> high heels, and SOMEONE's<Milo's> sneakered feet. At a concession stand, he cuts SOMEONE<Nicole> off and offers popcorn. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS132
00:26:50,00 --> 00:26:57,50
She bats it away and flees. On a patio, SOMEONE<Stewart> intercepts her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS133
00:26:56,00 --> 00:27:01,50
She passes him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS134
00:26:59,00 --> 00:27:06,50
SOMEONE's<Nicole's> four-inch stiletto heels carry her out to a drop-off area. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS135
00:27:04,00 --> 00:27:12,50
She approaches two rows of waiting cabs parked along a curb. SOMEONE's<Milo's> convertible arrives, blocking them. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS136
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:20,50
SOMEONE<Milo> gets out, steps in her path, and draws a gun. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS137
00:27:21,00 --> 00:27:25,50
She brushes past him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS138
00:27:30,00 --> 00:27:36,50
As SOMEONE<Milo> swaggers over, she tensely faces him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS139
00:27:35,00 --> 00:27:39,50
He steps in close. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS140
00:27:39,00 --> 00:27:45,50
Finding herself head to head with her ex, SOMEONE<Nicole> backs up a pace. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS141
00:27:50,00 --> 00:27:55,50
He hefts her over his shoulder. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS142
00:27:55,00 --> 00:28:01,50
She slaps at his back as he carries her to his car. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS143
00:28:01,00 --> 00:28:06,50
He pops the trunk and dumps her in. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS144
00:28:11,00 --> 00:28:16,50
SOMEONE<Stewart> hurries toward him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS145
00:28:15,00 --> 00:28:19,50
In the trunk, 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS146
00:28:19,00 --> 00:28:27,50
she smacks the lid. Her ex-husband backs the car up then pulls away. SOMEONE<Stewart> watches helplessly. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS147
00:28:26,00 --> 00:28:33,50
He rushes off. Now, a storefront sign reads, Blue Ink Tattoos. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS148
00:28:32,00 --> 00:28:38,50
Inside, SOMEONE's<Jimmy's> captor readies a needle. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS149
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:45,50
Duct tape holds SOMEONE's<Jimmy's> head in place. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS150
00:28:43,00 --> 00:28:48,50
His captor waves the needle in his face. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS151
00:29:03,00 --> 00:29:07,50
The chiseled thug blinks. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS152
00:29:06,00 --> 00:29:13,50
At Sid's Bail Bonds, Teresa chews gum as she strolls to the phone and answers it. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS153
00:29:42,00 --> 00:29:47,50
SOMEONE<Milo> checks his cell display. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS154
00:29:48,00 --> 00:29:52,50
SOMEONE<Milo> takes the incoming call. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS155
00:31:43,00 --> 00:31:48,50
The thug holds him at gunpoint. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS156
00:32:02,00 --> 00:32:06,50
She hits her head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS157
00:32:23,00 --> 00:32:28,50
The thug flips SOMEONE's<Jimmy's> phone shut. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS158
00:32:27,00 --> 00:32:32,50
Outside, the thug makes a call. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS159
00:32:39,00 --> 00:32:50,50
Reaching his SUV, he ends the call and gets in. He sets down a newspaper article featuring SOMEONE's<Nicole's> name and photo as the credited writer. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS160
00:32:47,00 --> 00:32:53,50
In his car, SOMEONE<Milo> notices smoke wafting from the back. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS161
00:32:51,00 --> 00:33:02,50
Later, he pops the trunk. SOMEONE<Nicole> throws the flare aside and punches SOMEONE<Milo> in the crotch. He chases her down the shoulder then tackles her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS162
00:32:59,00 --> 00:33:15,50
Now, In Atlantic City, a storefront sign reads, Souvenirs, SOMEONE's<Irene's> Gifts. The hulking goateed guy, SOMEONE<Dwight>, arrives sporting two black eyes and a gash across his nose He heads inside and lumbers to the rear. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS163
00:33:12,00 --> 00:33:23,50
He enters a dingy backroom where bookies work at stations along a table. As he arrives at a desk, an aging blonde swivels to face him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS164
00:33:29,00 --> 00:33:34,50
SOMEONE<Dwight> shifts his sheepish gaze. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS165
00:33:59,00 --> 00:34:06,50
At night at a gas station, SOMEONE<Nicole> sits handcuffed to SOMEONE's<Milo's> passenger door. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS166
00:34:05,00 --> 00:34:10,50
SOMEONE<Milo> washes the windshield. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS167
00:34:38,00 --> 00:34:43,50
She gives a resigned shrug. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS168
00:35:02,00 --> 00:35:09,50
SOMEONE<Milo> imagines Teresa chewing her gum and popping a bubble. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS169
00:35:32,00 --> 00:35:36,50
He replaces the gas nozzle. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS170
00:35:36,00 --> 00:35:41,50
He leans on his open window. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS171
00:35:42,00 --> 00:35:52,50
Later, Atlantic City's hotel casinos gleam in the night air. SOMEONE<Milo> works his jaw driving his blue convertible past them. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS172
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:05,50
She offers him a wad of cash. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS173
00:36:37,00 --> 00:36:41,50
She studies him skeptically. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS174
00:36:46,00 --> 00:36:50,50
She smells the cash. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS175
00:36:48,00 --> 00:36:53,50
SOMEONE<Milo> pouts then licks his lips. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS176
00:36:50,00 --> 00:36:56,50
Later, he unlocks her handcuffs and lets her out of the car. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS177
00:37:06,00 --> 00:37:13,50
Now, from his MINI Cooper, SOMEONE<Stewart> sees SOMEONE's<Milo's> car arrive at the Taj Mahal Casino. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS178
00:37:16,00 --> 00:37:20,50
With SOMEONE<Ray>.

In the casino. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS182
00:38:17,00 --> 00:38:23,50
Now, SOMEONE<Stewart> drives into the Taj Mahal parking lot. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS183
00:38:20,00 --> 00:38:26,50
Out of his car, he creeps up alongside SOMEONE's<Milo's> Delta '88. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS184
00:38:24,00 --> 00:38:28,50
He knocks on the trunk. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS185
00:38:31,00 --> 00:38:36,50
He presses an ear to the trunk and listens. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS186
00:38:39,00 --> 00:38:45,50
He opens the driver side door and pops the trunk. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS187
00:38:43,00 --> 00:38:47,50
He finds it empty. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS188
00:38:48,00 --> 00:38:52,50
SOMEONE<Ray> looks on. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS189
00:38:49,00 --> 00:38:54,50
He points at the car. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS190
00:39:12,00 --> 00:39:20,50
SOMEONE<Ray> slams SOMEONE's<Stewart's> head against the trunk. SOMEONE<Stewart> crumbles. Now, at a craps table, 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS191
00:39:28,00 --> 00:39:32,50
he shows her the dice. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS192
00:39:38,00 --> 00:39:44,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> frowns. SOMEONE<Milo> quirks his brow at her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS193
00:39:42,00 --> 00:39:47,50
She reluctantly purses her lips and blows on the dice. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS194
00:39:46,00 --> 00:39:51,50
He rolls a seven. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS195
00:39:50,00 --> 00:39:59,50
A croupier's hand nudges a tall stack of chips toward SOMEONE<Milo>. Later, SOMEONE<Nicole> blows on the dice again. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS196
00:39:58,00 --> 00:40:11,50
She gawks and SOMEONE<Milo> points excitedly. The stickman returns the dice to him, a croupier adds two more stacks of chips to his winnings, and SOMEONE<Milo> and SOMEONE<Nicole> both blow on the dice. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS197
00:40:08,00 --> 00:40:13,50
The bounty hunter rolls a seven. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS198
00:40:10,00 --> 00:40:15,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> fans herself nervously. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS199
00:40:12,00 --> 00:40:21,50
The croupier awards SOMEONE<Milo> two more stacks. Now, SOMEONE<Nicole> blows on the dice repeatedly. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS200
00:40:19,00 --> 00:40:24,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> cheers throwing her hands in the air. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS201
00:40:58,00 --> 00:41:02,50
She starts off. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS202
00:40:59,00 --> 00:41:03,50
He grabs her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS203
00:41:12,00 --> 00:41:17,50
He shows the dice but she keeps her lips together. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS204
00:41:22,00 --> 00:41:28,50
The stickman eyes SOMEONE<Milo>, who throws the dice. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS205
00:41:38,00 --> 00:41:42,50
He rolls. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS206
00:41:39,00 --> 00:41:44,50
Later, in a hallway. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS207
00:42:01,00 --> 00:42:06,50
Now, they enter a spacious and eclectic suite. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS208
00:42:06,00 --> 00:42:11,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> weaves past boldly upholstered furniture. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS209
00:42:09,00 --> 00:42:15,50
She admires the chic lamps and mod accessories. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS210
00:42:47,00 --> 00:42:54,50
He cuffs her to the headboard, plops down their bags, and heads out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS211
00:42:54,00 --> 00:42:59,50
As he stalks out, she flings a vase after him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS212
00:42:59,00 --> 00:43:11,50
Trapped by the handcuffs, she plops onto the bed. SOMEONE<Milo> struts out of the room and presses an elevator call button. He rubs his hands together then primps in a mirror. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS213
00:43:12,00 --> 00:43:19,50
He boards the elevator, presses a button, and snaps open the check from Teresa. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS214
00:43:20,00 --> 00:43:34,50
He kisses it and the elevator closes. Later, it opens revealing a disheveled SOMEONE<Milo> clutching a drink. His shirt half untucked and his collar sticking up, he staggers out and drains the glass. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS215
00:43:31,00 --> 00:43:44,50
Now he stumbles down the hall, leaning against a wall for support. The drunken man takes a rest then hobbles forward and bends over his door lock. He disappears inside. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS216
00:43:43,00 --> 00:43:54,50
In the bedroom, SOMEONE<Nicole> lies asleep. Her handcuffed arm leaning vertically against the headboard. SOMEONE<Milo> eyes her, swaying, then sets his gun on the nightstand. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS217
00:43:52,00 --> 00:43:57,50
Later, on his side, he turns off the light. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS218
00:43:54,00 --> 00:44:03,50
He flops onto his back fully dressed and in his shoes and scooches around getting comfy. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS219
00:44:04,00 --> 00:44:10,50
Later, SOMEONE's<Nicole's> eyes spring open. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS220
00:44:09,00 --> 00:44:20,50
Raising her brow, she looks around thoughtfully, then sits up and peeks over at SOMEONE<Milo>. Just past him, she spots his gun on the nightstand. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS221
00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:23,50
SOMEONE lies on her back then rolls toward him, 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS222
00:44:20,00 --> 00:44:27,50
sliding the handcuff along the top rail of the headboard. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS223
00:44:29,00 --> 00:44:37,50
She props herself up on her hands and knees then inches closer and reaches for the gun with her free hand. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS224
00:44:34,00 --> 00:44:43,50
Her fingers fall short. She tips off balance but catches herself before landing on top of SOMEONE<Milo>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS225
00:44:40,00 --> 00:44:50,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> braces herself on the headboard, digs her feet into the comforter, and makes her downward facing body as stiff as a board. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS226
00:44:48,00 --> 00:44:53,50
She carefully straddles SOMEONE<Milo>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS227
00:44:53,00 --> 00:44:58,50
He drowsily opens his eyes. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS228
00:45:00,00 --> 00:45:04,50
She musters a smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS229
00:45:05,00 --> 00:45:10,50
She playfully smacks the headboard. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS230
00:45:41,00 --> 00:45:46,50
She cranes her lips close to his. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS231
00:45:56,00 --> 00:46:01,50
He raises his gun in front of her face. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS232
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:04,50
She rears back. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS233
00:46:03,00 --> 00:46:07,50
She climbs off. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS234
00:46:09,00 --> 00:46:14,50
She turns her back to him and punches her pillow. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS235
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:16,50
He eyes her, smiling. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS236
00:46:14,00 --> 00:46:24,50
Daytime. A mural on a slim, brick building bears SOMEONE's<Irene's> name. SOMEONE<Dwight> enters the back room with a pizza. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS237
00:46:25,00 --> 00:46:31,50
SOMEONE<Irene> raises a golf club to let Ray pass. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS238
00:46:29,00 --> 00:46:36,50
He leads SOMEONE<Dwight> into a grungy bathroom where SOMEONE<Stewart> sits handcuffed to a pipe. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS239
00:46:57,00 --> 00:47:02,50
SOMEONE<Irene> hands SOMEONE<Dwight> the golf club. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS240
00:47:06,00 --> 00:47:10,50
SOMEONE<Dwight> hits him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS241
00:47:29,00 --> 00:47:33,50
Now, in the suite. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS242
00:47:31,00 --> 00:47:36,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> finds herself alone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS243
00:47:34,00 --> 00:47:38,50
A maid enters. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS244
00:47:37,00 --> 00:47:42,50
She peeks into the bedroom. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS245
00:47:40,00 --> 00:47:44,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> glances at the handcuff. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS246
00:48:02,00 --> 00:48:09,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE<Milo> steps out of the shower, tucking a towel around his waist. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS247
00:48:06,00 --> 00:48:16,50
In the bedroom, SOMEONE<Nicole> zips up SOMEONE's<Milo's> satchel. She tugs at the handcuff then hunkers down and winds up swinging the bag. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS248
00:48:15,00 --> 00:48:19,50
She flings it across the room. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS249
00:48:17,00 --> 00:48:22,50
It misses the ottoman and lands on the floor. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS250
00:48:23,00 --> 00:48:27,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE<Milo> looks up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS251
00:48:25,00 --> 00:48:31,50
As he opens the door, SOMEONE<Nicole> lies down and mimes a yawn. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS252
00:48:35,00 --> 00:48:40,50
She sits up and looks around. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS253
00:48:42,00 --> 00:48:47,50
She points at the handcuff. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS254
00:48:48,00 --> 00:48:52,50
He unlocks her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS255
00:48:53,00 --> 00:49:01,50
Massaging her wrist, SOMEONE<Nicole> strides to the bathroom. She sees SOMEONE<Milo> following her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS256
00:49:09,00 --> 00:49:14,50
He glances at her low-cut top then ogles her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS257
00:49:12,00 --> 00:49:18,50
She shrugs theatrically and enters the bathroom. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS258
00:49:15,00 --> 00:49:20,50
He steps up to the doors. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS259
00:49:21,00 --> 00:49:27,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE<Nicole> takes SOMEONE's<Milo's> Taser from under her skirt. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS260
00:49:25,00 --> 00:49:29,50
She turns it on. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS262
00:49:43,00 --> 00:49:53,50
She tasers him in the neck. SOMEONE<Milo> convulses and crumples. SOMEONE<Nicole> skips over him and grabs her bag. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS263
00:49:50,00 --> 00:49:56,50
Later, at the elevators, she presses the call button. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS264
00:49:53,00 --> 00:50:08,50
One opens behind her and she hurries aboard, shoes in hand. Another elevator opens and the chiseled thug strides out. He glimpses SOMEONE<Nicole> as her elevator closes. He quickly presses the call button. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS266
00:50:39,00 --> 00:50:45,50
as the thug searches for her a pedicab pulls up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS267
00:50:47,00 --> 00:50:52,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> hops into the shaded seat. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS268
00:50:51,00 --> 00:50:56,50
They ride away. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS269
00:50:59,00 --> 00:51:04,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> looks in her bag. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS270
00:51:10,00 --> 00:51:14,50
The driver checks her out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS271
00:51:19,00 --> 00:51:25,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> looks off and gives a half-wince, half-smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS272
00:51:26,00 --> 00:51:32,50
Later, SOMEONE<Nicole> pedals the stolen pedicab by herself. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS273
00:51:36,00 --> 00:51:48,50
The teenager chases her on foot. She rides down a ramp. Now, in the hotel suite's bathroom, SOMEONE<Milo> awakens on the floor. Holding his head, he sits up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS274
00:51:45,00 --> 00:52:00,50
Later, an aerial view shows his baby-blue Delta driving away from the Taj Mahal. Behind the wheel, SOMEONE<Milo> eyes the two-inch red SOMEONE<mark> on his neck in the rear-view mirror then touches it and winces. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS275
00:51:58,00 --> 00:52:07,50
Now, SOMEONE<Nicole> struggles to pedal down a highway. Cringing, she leans wearily over the handlebars. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS276
00:52:04,00 --> 00:52:12,50
SOMEONE<Milo> spots the pedicab from a block behind and gives a vengeful smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS277
00:52:10,00 --> 00:52:16,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> spots him and scowls. She pedals faster. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS278
00:52:14,00 --> 00:52:20,50
He drives up and taps the back of the pedicab with his bumper. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS279
00:52:18,00 --> 00:52:22,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> gapes. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS280
00:52:21,00 --> 00:52:40,50
SOMEONE<Milo> accelerates and taps her again. Several other vehicles speed past them. SOMEONE<Milo> drives up close behind her then backs off. SOMEONE<Nicole> pedals exhaustedly then halts, slumping. SOMEONE<Milo> stops inches behind her then scoots forward and bumps the pedicab again. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS281
00:52:42,00 --> 00:52:49,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> sneers. A sedan passes them and she climbs off the bike. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS282
00:52:48,00 --> 00:52:57,50
She grabs up her purse and glares at him, then stalks around to the passenger door and reaches for the handle. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS283
00:52:54,00 --> 00:52:58,50
SOMEONE<Milo> backs up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS284
00:53:05,00 --> 00:53:16,50
He shifts into park and raises both hands innocently. SOMEONE<Nicole> glances around. She treads back to the door, her eyes locked on SOMEONE's<Milo's>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS285
00:53:13,00 --> 00:53:20,50
As she reaches for the handle, the car lurches forward. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS286
00:53:26,00 --> 00:53:34,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> winces, stifling tears, then stares off. SOMEONE<Milo> eyes her churlishly. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS287
00:53:33,00 --> 00:53:39,50
Her lips tighten and she shakes her head, looking skyward. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS288
00:53:39,00 --> 00:53:43,50
She claps a hand to her mouth. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS289
00:53:45,00 --> 00:53:50,50
SOMEONE<Milo> glances away. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS290
00:53:47,00 --> 00:53:54,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> brushes her hair out of her face then sobs into her hand. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS291
00:53:55,00 --> 00:54:01,50
He shifts the car into park, gets out, and faces his ex-wife. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS292
00:54:03,00 --> 00:54:09,50
She stays put. Her posture wounded and childlike. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS293
00:54:11,00 --> 00:54:15,50
He knits his brow. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS294
00:54:13,00 --> 00:54:19,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> tugs on the door handle, which sticks, then gives. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS295
00:54:16,00 --> 00:54:22,50
She climbs into the seat and slams the door shut. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS296
00:54:19,00 --> 00:54:26,50
SOMEONE<Milo> looks over his shoulder and spots a billboard in a field. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS297
00:54:23,00 --> 00:54:32,50
It reads, Cupid's Cabin and shows a picture of a bed and breakfast in a Victorian style mansion. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS298
00:54:29,00 --> 00:54:34,50
The bounty hunter purses his lips. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS299
00:54:35,00 --> 00:54:40,50
He shuffles back alongside the car. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS300
00:54:37,00 --> 00:54:47,50
In the passenger seat, SOMEONE<Nicole> wipes her eyes then rests her forehead on the back of her hand, hiding her face. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS301
00:54:44,00 --> 00:54:51,50
SOMEONE<Milo> sheepishly opens his door and takes his seat at the wheel. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS302
00:54:48,00 --> 00:54:52,50
He glances at SOMEONE<Nicole>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS303
00:54:50,00 --> 00:54:57,50
He backs the car away from the pedicab, steers around it, and drives off. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS304
00:54:54,00 --> 00:55:02,50
Now, SOMEONE<Irene> leads an elderly man with fuzzy hair into the grungy bathroom. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS305
00:54:59,00 --> 00:55:04,50
SOMEONE<Stewart> rests his leg on the toilet. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS306
00:55:12,00 --> 00:55:17,50
The man takes out a giant syringe. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS307
00:55:42,00 --> 00:55:47,50
The vet jabs the needle into SOMEONE's<Stewart's> neck. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS308
00:55:46,00 --> 00:55:54,50
Now, in SOMEONE's<Milo's> car, SOMEONE<Nicole> rides with one wrist cuffed to the door. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS309
00:56:16,00 --> 00:56:23,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> spots a luxury pick-up in her side mirror then eyes it over her shoulder. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS310
00:56:27,00 --> 00:56:32,50
SOMEONE<Milo> aims the rear-view mirror at it. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS311
00:56:55,00 --> 00:57:00,50
The pick-up pulls up beside them. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS312
00:56:58,00 --> 00:57:13,50
As the chiseled thug aims a gun at them from behind the wheel, SOMEONE<Nicole> jams her foot on the gas pedal. SOMEONE<Milo> veers onto the shoulder, then into oncoming traffic on a one-way street. The thug shoots at them from the parallel two-way road. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS313
00:57:11,00 --> 00:57:28,50
Drawing his gun, SOMEONE<Milo> returns fire. SOMEONE<Nicole> cowers. The pick-up swerves onto the one-way street and jams itself alongside the Delta, mangling the convertible's headlight and SOMEONE<fender>. The vehicles separate. SOMEONE<Milo> bashes the pick-up and takes aim. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS314
00:57:27,00 --> 00:57:37,50
As they speed forward, shoving against each other, SOMEONE<Nicole> spots an SUV headed straight for the thug's vehicle. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS315
00:57:35,00 --> 00:57:53,50
Swerving, the chiseled man bursts through construction barricades then ramps up a stack of barricades and launches into mid-air. The pick-up lands on its roof and skids across the two-lane road. Reaching a grassy field, it tumbles onto its side. SOMEONE<Milo> pulls over. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS316
00:57:52,00 --> 00:57:57,50
She wrenches her cuffed arm. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS317
00:57:59,00 --> 00:58:04,50
He gets out and surveys the damage. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS318
00:58:02,00 --> 00:58:13,50
As SOMEONE<Milo> jogs toward the luxury pick-up, the thug wriggles out through a window on the other side. Nearing he vehicle, SOMEONE<Milo> slows and aims his gun. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS319
00:58:10,00 --> 00:58:16,50
His assailant gets to his feet, using the pick-up as cover. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS320
00:58:14,00 --> 00:58:25,50
The bounty hunter ventures toward the vehicles tail-end and the thug edges around its front. SOMEONE<Milo> arrives on the other side and finds no sign of the gunman. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS321
00:58:23,00 --> 00:58:29,50
Turning back, he finds himself aiming at SOMEONE<Nicole>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS322
00:58:26,00 --> 00:58:31,50
She clutches her door's broken-off inner panel. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS324
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:46,50
On the one way street, the thug yanks a woman from her mini-van, gets in, and speeds off. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS325
00:59:12,00 --> 00:59:16,50
SOMEONE<Milo> gawks. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS326
00:59:56,00 --> 01:00:01,50
Later, they search the pick-up together. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS327
01:00:04,00 --> 01:00:08,50
He opens the covered bed. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS328
01:00:10,00 --> 01:00:14,50
He finds a golf bag. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS329
01:00:15,00 --> 01:00:20,50
She hurls the cup at him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS330
01:00:22,00 --> 01:00:27,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> climbs out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS331
01:00:41,00 --> 01:00:46,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> notices a tag. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS332
01:00:53,00 --> 01:01:08,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> glares then yields a smile. Now, SOMEONE's<Milo's> ragtop follows a winding road toward a mansion perched atop an immaculately landscaped hill. At the mansions entrance, they surrender the car to a valet. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS333
01:01:32,00 --> 01:01:38,50
Inside, a pristinely quaffed woman works a reception desk. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS334
01:01:42,00 --> 01:01:48,50
Her red painted lips primly stifle an excited smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS335
01:01:50,00 --> 01:01:54,50
They follow her through the lobby. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS336
01:02:03,00 --> 01:02:07,50
The woman frowns. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS337
01:02:47,00 --> 01:02:52,50
The woman scowls suspiciously. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS338
01:02:51,00 --> 01:02:57,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> smiles tightly and SOMEONE<Milo> shakes his head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS339
01:03:23,00 --> 01:03:29,50
The couple steps out back and wanders through a festive picnic. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS340
01:03:48,00 --> 01:03:53,50
He walks her to the party's edge. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS341
01:03:51,00 --> 01:03:55,50
They find some caddies. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS342
01:04:00,00 --> 01:04:05,50
One rumples his lips then flees. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS343
01:04:03,00 --> 01:04:07,50
He scurries down some steps. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS344
01:04:06,00 --> 01:04:10,50
SOMEONE<Milo> gives chase. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS345
01:04:08,00 --> 01:04:31,50
The caddy leads him down a hill and across a grassy driving range. The bounty hunter frantically dodges golf balls as they whiz toward him. He leaps over one then ducks another. One ball buzzes low over his head and a fourth whips past his nose. As he leaves the range and runs onto a green, SOMEONE<Nicole> drives up in a golf cart. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS346
01:04:45,00 --> 01:04:51,50
Elsewhere, the caddy peeks out from a sunken sand trap. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS347
01:04:54,00 --> 01:04:59,50
The caddy crawls out from hiding. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS348
01:04:56,00 --> 01:05:03,50
As he holds the flag for putting golfers, SOMEONE<Milo> spies him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS349
01:05:00,00 --> 01:05:09,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> steers the cart in the caddy's direction. The young man spots them and his polite smile fades. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS350
01:05:08,00 --> 01:05:14,50
Dropping the flag, he dashes over a hill. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS351
01:05:11,00 --> 01:05:17,50
Cresting the rise, the cart speeds toward a pond. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS352
01:05:17,00 --> 01:05:23,50
SOMEONE<Milo> leaps out, tackles the caddy, and tumbles with him into the water. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS353
01:05:20,00 --> 01:05:26,50
The out of control cart plunges in beside them. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS354
01:05:37,00 --> 01:05:41,50
SOMEONE<Milo> dunks him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS355
01:05:56,00 --> 01:06:01,50
SOMEONE<Milo> dunks him again. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS356
01:06:07,00 --> 01:06:12,50
He shows his tattooed chest. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS357
01:06:17,00 --> 01:06:23,50
SOMEONE<Milo> swaps looks with SOMEONE<Nicole> then releases the caddy. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS358
01:06:20,00 --> 01:06:25,50
Now, at the tattoo parlor. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS360
01:06:39,00 --> 01:06:43,50
she pulls her hair back. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS361
01:06:54,00 --> 01:06:59,50
He plucks it from her neck. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS362
01:07:14,00 --> 01:07:19,50
SOMEONE<Milo> digs out his cell and holds it up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS363
01:07:18,00 --> 01:07:22,50
He answers it. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS364
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:46,50
SOMEONE<Milo> frowns uneasily at SOMEONE<Nicole>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS365
01:07:58,00 --> 01:08:02,50
He ends the call. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS366
01:08:00,00 --> 01:08:04,50
In the convertible 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS367
01:08:12,00 --> 01:08:19,50
at a turnoff, they pass a sign reading, Cupid's Cabin. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS368
01:08:16,00 --> 01:08:24,50
Later, they face a three-story Victorian style house with a wrap-around porch. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS369
01:08:34,00 --> 01:08:39,50
A curly-haired woman answers the door. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS370
01:08:46,00 --> 01:08:51,50
A chubby man arrives. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS371
01:09:14,00 --> 01:09:21,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> smiles sadly at SOMEONE<Milo>, who gives a nostalgic nod. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS372
01:09:39,00 --> 01:09:44,50
SOMEONE<Milo> and SOMEONE<Nicole> muster smiles. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS373
01:09:47,00 --> 01:09:53,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> stares, her features frozen in a thoughtful gape. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS374
01:11:05,00 --> 01:11:10,50
The older woman gawks. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS375
01:11:15,00 --> 01:11:22,50
Nighttime. In frumpy clothes, SOMEONE<Milo> and SOMEONE<Nicole> dine on a patio. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS376
01:11:51,00 --> 01:11:56,50
He eyes the adjoining building. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS377
01:11:54,00 --> 01:11:59,50
They share a warm smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS378
01:11:57,00 --> 01:12:04,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> drops her gaze, fiddling with her silky honey-brown hair. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS379
01:12:13,00 --> 01:12:17,50
She shrugs a hand. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS380
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:20,50
SOMEONE<Milo> lifts his brow. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS381
01:12:20,00 --> 01:12:25,50
Looking away, she shrugs again. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS382
01:12:40,00 --> 01:12:44,50
SOMEONE<Milo> blinks at her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS383
01:12:53,00 --> 01:12:58,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> regards him thoughtfully. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS384
01:12:57,00 --> 01:13:02,50
He gives a boyish half-smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS385
01:13:08,00 --> 01:13:13,50
She raises her champagne glass. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS386
01:13:10,00 --> 01:13:14,50
SOMEONE<Milo> follows suit. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS387
01:13:22,00 --> 01:13:30,50
They tap glasses. SOMEONE<Milo> sips his sparkling wine with a knitted brow. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS388
01:13:28,00 --> 01:13:34,50
SOMEONE's<Nicole's> smile fades to a tight smirk. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS389
01:14:19,00 --> 01:14:24,50
SOMEONE<Milo> gives a sad shrug. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS390
01:14:21,00 --> 01:14:29,50
Resting her cheek against her hand, SOMEONE<Nicole> shakes her head and gazes skyward. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS391
01:14:53,00 --> 01:15:00,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> looks away then faces him defenselessly. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS392
01:15:05,00 --> 01:15:11,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> tearfully tightens her lips. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS393
01:15:08,00 --> 01:15:15,50
Now, the two stroll down a hallway lit cheerily with glass-shaded lamps. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS394
01:15:13,00 --> 01:15:19,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> pauses to eye an inscription on one of the doors. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS395
01:15:16,00 --> 01:15:26,50
Reaching another door, they find a lavender heart-shaped sign that reads, Bliss in rosy cursive letters. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS396
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:31,50
SOMEONE<Milo> and SOMEONE<Nicole> chuckle at the frilly placard then share a warm lingering gaze. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS397
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:36,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> starts to open her mouth, then shakes her head and smiles. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS398
01:15:35,00 --> 01:15:40,50
Staring at her intently, he nods. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS400
01:15:40,00 --> 01:15:47,50
As he unlocks the door, he steps in close and leans his face toward hers. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS401
01:15:50,00 --> 01:15:57,50
SOMEONE<Milo> opens the door, revealing a narrow four-post bed on a lavender carpet. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS402
01:15:55,00 --> 01:16:01,50
Table lamps cast their soft glow against the rosy wall. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS403
01:15:58,00 --> 01:16:05,50
SOMEONE<Milo> gestures her inside and SOMEONE<Nicole> precedes him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS404
01:16:02,00 --> 01:16:08,50
At the Borgata lounge, Kitty takes a phone call. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS406
01:16:36,00 --> 01:16:40,50
SOMEONE<Edmund> drops by. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS407
01:16:42,00 --> 01:16:46,50
SOMEONE<Milo> accepts a tray. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS408
01:16:54,00 --> 01:17:00,50
Checking SOMEONE's<Nicole's> wallet, he finds their wedding photo. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS409
01:16:58,00 --> 01:17:04,50
It shows SOMEONE<Nicole> and him beaming as bride and groom. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS410
01:17:02,00 --> 01:17:07,50
SOMEONE<Milo> faces SOMEONE<Edmund>, who waits in the hall. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS411
01:17:07,00 --> 01:17:11,50
He shuts the door. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS412
01:17:09,00 --> 01:17:16,50
SOMEONE<Milo> moves from the door, his eyes fixed on the photo, and his lips parted. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS414
01:17:52,00 --> 01:17:59,50
she slugs back an entire cocktail and gives a bracing twitch of the brow. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS415
01:18:08,00 --> 01:18:12,50
SOMEONE<Milo> and Teresa talk. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS416
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:33,50
SOMEONE<Sid> enters with his kids. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS417
01:18:40,00 --> 01:18:44,50
SOMEONE<Sid> picks up the phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS418
01:19:10,00 --> 01:19:15,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> smiles. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS419
01:19:27,00 --> 01:19:31,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> hangs up then stares at her reflection in the mirror. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS422
01:19:44,00 --> 01:19:51,50
SOMEONE<Milo> lights candles around the room and pops a CD into a player. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS423
01:19:56,00 --> 01:20:01,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> peeks out from the bathroom. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS424
01:20:07,00 --> 01:20:12,50
His back to SOMEONE<Nicole>, SOMEONE<Milo> hangs up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS425
01:20:09,00 --> 01:20:18,50
His ex-wife returns to the bathroom unnoticed. Now, she steps out wrapped tightly in a bathrobe. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS426
01:20:17,00 --> 01:20:22,50
She avoids SOMEONE's<Milo's> gaze. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS427
01:20:19,00 --> 01:20:29,50
Marching to the bed, she blows out a candle on a bedside table, turns off the CD player, and hurls some pillows to the floor. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS428
01:20:32,00 --> 01:20:38,50
She throws down more pillows until only a few remain. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS429
01:20:39,00 --> 01:20:45,50
She blows out another candle and climbs under the covers. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS430
01:20:59,00 --> 01:21:11,50
Lying on her back, SOMEONE<Nicole> closes her eyes then sneakily peeks one open. She watches as SOMEONE<Milo> blows out more candles. He snuffs the last one with his hand. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS431
01:21:14,00 --> 01:21:23,50
He pops a candy into his mouth and climbs into bed fully clothed. He scoots up against SOMEONE<Nicole> and folds his arms. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS432
01:21:24,00 --> 01:21:31,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> eyes him as he chews. He glances over and she looks away. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS433
01:21:28,00 --> 01:21:33,50
He closes his eyes. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS434
01:21:42,00 --> 01:21:49,50
She climbs out of bed and grabs a blanket then swipes the pillow out from behind SOMEONE's<Milo's> head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS435
01:21:47,00 --> 01:21:51,50
He bumps the headboard. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS436
01:21:49,00 --> 01:21:57,50
As he winces, SOMEONE<Nicole> throws the pillow at his face. She settles onto a window bench. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS437
01:22:00,00 --> 01:22:06,50
Closing his eyes, SOMEONE<Milo> folds his hands behind his head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS438
01:22:03,00 --> 01:22:09,50
From the bench, SOMEONE<Nicole> turns and glares at him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS439
01:22:06,00 --> 01:22:13,50
Later, she wears her own clothes as she slams the suite's door. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS440
01:22:10,00 --> 01:22:16,50
SOMEONE<Milo> stirs. He finds himself cuffed to the bed. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS441
01:22:20,00 --> 01:22:26,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> jingles the handcuff keys. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS442
01:22:25,00 --> 01:22:29,50
She leaves. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS443
01:22:27,00 --> 01:22:33,50
SOMEONE<Milo> yanks on his cuff secured tightly to the headboard. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS444
01:22:32,00 --> 01:22:41,50
As SOMEONE<Nicole> races out the door, SOMEONE<Milo> frantically yanks on the headboard. He breaks off the top and falls back onto the bed. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS445
01:22:39,00 --> 01:22:46,50
Now, as he rushes outside, SOMEONE<Nicole> pulls his car out of the drive. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS446
01:22:45,00 --> 01:22:52,50
Still attached to the headboard, he chases after her. The convertible speeds away. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS447
01:22:50,00 --> 01:22:56,50
He watches as it disappears around a corner. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS448
01:22:54,00 --> 01:23:00,50
Meanwhile, at a gas station, SOMEONE<Dwight> opens his trunk. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS449
01:22:58,00 --> 01:23:05,50
He plucks a SOMEONE<bill> from the garbage bag full of cash and heads toward a convenient store. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS450
01:23:12,00 --> 01:23:21,50
SOMEONE<Dwight> halts, gives Ray the finger, and steps into the store. Ray spots SOMEONE's<Milo's> car as it rides by. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS452
01:23:32,00 --> 01:23:38,50
At cupid's cabin, as SOMEONE<Milo> stands on the front stoop, SOMEONE<Edmund> shuts the door. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS453
01:23:35,00 --> 01:23:45,50
SOMEONE<Milo> watches as a black luxury sedan pulls up to the porch steps. A young couple climbs out and he approaches the driver. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS454
01:23:47,00 --> 01:23:54,50
As the couple heads up the front steps, SOMEONE<Milo> climbs into the car and peels out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS455
01:23:52,00 --> 01:24:09,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Nicole> drives SOMEONE's<Milo's> car. She spots a storefront with a Pink awning. Its psychedelic sign reads, Blue Ink Tattoos. Now, inside the tattoo parlor, SOMEONE<Nicole> strolls to the counter where a woman with a Mohawk and multiple piercings works. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS456
01:24:11,00 --> 01:24:15,50
The woman glances at her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS457
01:24:15,00 --> 01:24:19,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> frowns. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS458
01:24:33,00 --> 01:24:38,50
A bald tattoo artist eyes SOMEONE<Nicole>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS459
01:24:36,00 --> 01:24:41,50
She struts toward him, hand on her hip. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS460
01:24:44,00 --> 01:24:49,50
She grabs her breasts. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS461
01:24:54,00 --> 01:24:59,50
She frames her pelvis with her hands. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS462
01:24:57,00 --> 01:25:03,50
She runs a hand down her thigh then pats it. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS463
01:25:01,00 --> 01:25:06,50
The tattoo artist eyes SOMEONE<Darla>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS464
01:25:05,00 --> 01:25:10,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> turns to the tatted clerk. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS465
01:25:09,00 --> 01:25:16,50
Now, SOMEONE<Nicole> sits in a chair in a small room papered in tattoo designs. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS466
01:25:14,00 --> 01:25:18,50
He draws a curtain. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS467
01:25:24,00 --> 01:25:28,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> sits. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS468
01:25:31,00 --> 01:25:35,50
SOMEONE's<Nicole's> eyes widen. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS469
01:25:34,00 --> 01:25:40,50
Sitting beside her, SOMEONE<Boner> leans back and smiles. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS470
01:25:47,00 --> 01:25:53,50
With a wave, SOMEONE<Nicole> hurries through the parlor. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS471
01:25:50,00 --> 01:25:58,50
Brushing her hair out of her face, she peers over her shoulder then casually heads to the bathroom. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS472
01:25:55,00 --> 01:26:13,50
She opens the door, steps inside, and waits briefly. Glancing around, she creeps out of the bathroom and makes her way up some stairs. Now, she opens a door to a wood-paneled entry way. She cautiously checks over her shoulder then tiptoes inside. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS473
01:26:10,00 --> 01:26:20,50
Seen through another doorway, an office chair sits at a desk with a giant mural of a snarling tiger behind it. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS474
01:26:17,00 --> 01:26:23,50
A red and black bowling shirt hangs on the back of the chair. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS475
01:26:20,00 --> 01:26:25,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> scurries into the office. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS476
01:26:23,00 --> 01:26:31,50
She sifts through a stack of paperwork then sits at the desk and rifles through files and drawers. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS477
01:26:28,00 --> 01:26:39,50
Swiveling in the chair, she spots a framed photo of a bowling team. In it, SOMEONE<Bobby> and SOMEONE<Earl> pose with two teammates. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS478
01:26:39,00 --> 01:26:44,50
A caption reads, Police Bowling League. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS479
01:26:43,00 --> 01:26:50,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> looks around then sets the photo back on a trophy shelf. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS480
01:26:50,00 --> 01:27:05,50
Scanning the office, she follows the sound around a corner and finds a louvered door locked by a deadbolt. She undoes the lock, opens the door, and finds SOMEONE<Jimmy> inside. His mouth and wrists duct taped. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS481
01:27:07,00 --> 01:27:12,50
Downstairs, SOMEONE<Earl> enters. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS482
01:27:13,00 --> 01:27:20,50
Upstairs, SOMEONE<Nicole> cuts tape binding SOMEONE's<Jimmy's> wrists. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS483
01:27:23,00 --> 01:27:38,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> leads SOMEONE<Jimmy> out a side door then rushes back in, grabs the bowling photo, and hurries out. SOMEONE<Earl> enters through the front door, spots the open closet, and draws his gun. Looking inside, he finds it empty. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS485
01:27:44,00 --> 01:27:50,50
They race down the street. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Earl> makes a call. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS487
01:27:56,00 --> 01:28:01,50
they get in SOMEONE's<Milo's> car. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS488
01:27:58,00 --> 01:28:03,50
SOMEONE's<Irene's> thugs sit in back. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS489
01:28:17,00 --> 01:28:21,50
They brandish their guns. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS490
01:28:20,00 --> 01:28:24,50
SOMEONE<Jimmy> shrugs at SOMEONE<Nicole>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS491
01:28:24,00 --> 01:28:32,50
As SOMEONE<Jimmy> scrambles out, SOMEONE<Nicole> gawks. With a parting glance, SOMEONE<Jimmy> sprints away. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS492
01:28:34,00 --> 01:28:55,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> frowns at Ray. SOMEONE<Dwight> lets his head lull back. Now, SOMEONE<Milo> spies his car in a nearby parking lot. He pulls in. A mural of two widespread female legs flanks the hot-pink back door of a strip club named, Double D's. SOMEONE<Milo> climbs out of the borrowed car, satchel in hand. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS493
01:28:52,00 --> 01:28:58,50
He checks his phone and flips it open. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS494
01:29:16,00 --> 01:29:21,50
SOMEONE<Milo> approaches a purple and white muscle car. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS495
01:29:27,00 --> 01:29:33,50
Inside the strip club, SOMEONE<Dwight> eyes his phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS496
01:29:31,00 --> 01:29:37,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Milo> shoots the lock of SOMEONE's<Dwight's> trunk and opens it. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS497
01:29:34,00 --> 01:29:40,50
He finds the garbage bag of cash inside. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS498
01:29:43,00 --> 01:29:50,50
He answers his phone and casually leans on the open trunk lid. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS499
01:29:58,00 --> 01:30:03,50
He slings the garbage bag over his shoulder. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS500
01:30:11,00 --> 01:30:16,50
SOMEONE<Milo> enters the club. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS501
01:30:34,00 --> 01:30:39,50
SOMEONE<Dwight> hands SOMEONE<Nicole> the cell. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS502
01:30:51,00 --> 01:30:57,50
SOMEONE<Milo> watches SOMEONE<Nicole> with her captors and hangs up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS503
01:31:04,00 --> 01:31:11,50
SOMEONE<Milo> watches as the two thugs escort his ex-wife through the strip club. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS504
01:31:08,00 --> 01:31:15,50
They stop at a neon restroom sign and she heads inside. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS505
01:31:12,00 --> 01:31:17,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE's<Nicole's> shoulders sag. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS506
01:31:17,00 --> 01:31:25,50
Across the club, SOMEONE<Milo> watches the thugs unnoticed. He answers his phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS508
01:31:36,00 --> 01:31:42,50
Outside the restroom, SOMEONE<Milo> tosses cash at some patrons. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS509
01:31:47,00 --> 01:31:53,50
SOMEONE<Milo> hurls cash at the dancers onstage. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS510
01:31:53,00 --> 01:32:07,50
As SOMEONE<Milo> tosses bills to patrons and employees, the thugs try to grab the cash from their hands. SOMEONE<Milo> empties the garbage bag on a pool table then runs onstage with more money. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS511
01:32:06,00 --> 01:32:12,50
SOMEONE<Dwight> pushes people from the pool table. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS512
01:32:11,00 --> 01:32:18,50
He punches a guy. SOMEONE<Milo> finds SOMEONE<Nicole> in the restroom. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS513
01:32:20,00 --> 01:32:24,50
A brawl breaks out in the club. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS515
01:33:07,00 --> 01:33:12,50
Back in the bathroom, SOMEONE<Nicole> stares wistfully. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS516
01:33:13,00 --> 01:33:24,50
He leads her through the chaos. At the pool table a formidable pole dancer piggy-backs SOMEONE<Dwight>. As Ray shoves her off, she grabs a bottle. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS517
01:33:23,00 --> 01:33:29,50
The woman smashes it on SOMEONE's<Dwight's> head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS518
01:33:27,00 --> 01:33:33,50
He falls. Ray faces the dancer. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS519
01:33:33,00 --> 01:33:37,50
She knocks him out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS520
01:33:34,00 --> 01:33:39,50
Now, in the police department. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS521
01:34:18,00 --> 01:34:25,50
In the ragtop, SOMEONE<Milo> ends the call and glances at SOMEONE<Nicole>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS522
01:34:39,00 --> 01:34:53,50
The convertible speeds down a street and through an intersection. Now, in the depository building, SOMEONE<Earl> packs evidence baggies filled with white powder into a brown paper bag then rolls the top down. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS523
01:34:51,00 --> 01:34:58,50
Outside, the Delta '88 sits parked across the street. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS524
01:36:17,00 --> 01:36:25,50
A dark sedan drives around the corner of the depository and pulls into a parking spot. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS525
01:36:22,00 --> 01:36:26,50
SOMEONE's<Bobby's> at the wheel. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS526
01:36:23,00 --> 01:36:27,50
SOMEONE<Milo> slumps. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS527
01:36:32,00 --> 01:36:39,50
They lock gazes then watch SOMEONE<Bobby> enter the depository. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS528
01:36:36,00 --> 01:36:41,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Bobby> exits a freight elevator. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS529
01:36:47,00 --> 01:36:52,50
SOMEONE<Bobby> shifts his confused stare. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS530
01:36:50,00 --> 01:36:59,50
Downstairs, SOMEONE<Milo> and SOMEONE<Nicole> enter through a main door. A clerk behind a cage-wire barrier addresses them. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS532
01:37:08,00 --> 01:37:13,50
SOMEONE<Earl> sets the paper bag down. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS533
01:37:11,00 --> 01:37:17,50
The men shoot at each other. SOMEONE<Milo> grabs the clerk through a window. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS534
01:37:16,00 --> 01:37:23,50
The clerk hits a button on his desk. SOMEONE<Nicole> opens a nearby gate. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS535
01:37:21,00 --> 01:37:33,50
SOMEONE<Milo> releases the clerk, who grabs a phone. Now, SOMEONE<Milo> creeps up a stairwell, his gun drawn. SOMEONE<Nicole> follows. Later, they exit the stairwell. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS536
01:37:30,00 --> 01:37:36,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> fearfully trots up and hides behind SOMEONE<Milo>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS537
01:37:35,00 --> 01:37:41,50
He glares toward her feet and she mouths, Sorry. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS538
01:37:38,00 --> 01:37:45,50
As SOMEONE<Nicole> surveys their surroundings, SOMEONE<Milo> takes cover behind a pillar. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS539
01:37:42,00 --> 01:37:47,50
He irritably waves her over. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS540
01:37:46,00 --> 01:37:54,50
A view through tall shelving units crammed with evidence shows the couple prowl forward. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS541
01:37:51,00 --> 01:37:58,50
As they sneak, SOMEONE<Nicole> taps SOMEONE's<Milo's> shoulder and he wheels around with his gun. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS542
01:37:59,00 --> 01:38:12,50
Blood stains the freight elevator and they glimpse a fallen man's feet. As SOMEONE<Earl> skulks off, SOMEONE<Milo> and SOMEONE<Nicole> slink toward the elevator and find SOMEONE<Bobby> bleeding inside. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS543
01:38:09,00 --> 01:38:13,50
They hurry over. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS544
01:38:25,00 --> 01:38:30,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> swaps looks with SOMEONE<Milo>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS545
01:38:36,00 --> 01:38:43,50
SOMEONE<Milo> stalks off, gun raised. Back in the elevator, SOMEONE<Bobby> looks to SOMEONE<Nicole>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS546
01:38:51,00 --> 01:38:56,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> glares at him. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS547
01:38:53,00 --> 01:39:00,50
Out among the industrial shelves, SOMEONE<Milo> creeps past aisles. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS548
01:38:57,00 --> 01:39:04,50
SOMEONE<Earl> hides at the end of one unit and watches SOMEONE<Milo> creeping by. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS550
01:39:08,00 --> 01:39:14,50
Back in the elevator, SOMEONE<Nicole> points at SOMEONE<Bobby> insistently then creeps out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS551
01:39:11,00 --> 01:39:17,50
In the depository, SOMEONE<Milo> prowls down an aisle. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS552
01:39:14,00 --> 01:39:21,50
He aims his gun around a corner and scans the vacant shadows. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS553
01:39:18,00 --> 01:39:25,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> minces up to a shelving unit and peeks around it. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS554
01:39:22,00 --> 01:39:28,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE<Milo> ducks low then skulks forward. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS555
01:39:26,00 --> 01:39:35,50
SOMEONE<Earl> sidles down an aisle, grabs SOMEONE's<Milo's> shoulder, and jabs his gun against the bounty hunter's neck. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS556
01:39:33,00 --> 01:39:40,50
Hidden, SOMEONE<Nicole> spots them. SOMEONE<Milo> drops his gun. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS557
01:39:39,00 --> 01:39:45,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> mouths, Oh God and searches the shelves around her. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS558
01:40:02,00 --> 01:40:18,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> spots a pair of evidence boxes. One labeled, Gotti, K and the other Gotti, V. A long flat box beneath them reads handle with care. As SOMEONE<Milo> kneels, SOMEONE<Nicole> finds an outline of a shotgun printed on top. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS559
01:40:18,00 --> 01:40:22,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> takes aim. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS560
01:40:23,00 --> 01:40:28,50
SOMEONE<Milo> grins. SOMEONE<Earl> fumes. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS561
01:40:27,00 --> 01:40:33,50
She blows a box to pieces. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS562
01:40:32,00 --> 01:40:39,50
As SOMEONE<Earl> turns to shoot, SOMEONE<Milo> sweeps his legs. SOMEONE<Earl> misses. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS563
01:40:39,00 --> 01:40:47,50
Punched repeatedly, SOMEONE<Earl> collapses. SOMEONE<Milo> kicks his weapon away from him then glances at SOMEONE<Nicole>. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS564
01:40:44,00 --> 01:40:52,50
Daytime, outside. Dozens of police cruisers surround the depository. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS565
01:41:38,00 --> 01:41:42,50
She kisses SOMEONE's<Bobby's> cheek. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS566
01:41:41,00 --> 01:41:49,50
As she leaves she takes a call from SOMEONE<Stewart>, who limps between a warehouse and an empty lot. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS567
01:42:37,00 --> 01:42:42,50
SOMEONE<Stewart> drops. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS568
01:42:44,00 --> 01:42:48,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> hangs up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS569
01:42:45,00 --> 01:42:50,50
Later, in SOMEONE's ragtop, 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS570
01:42:54,00 --> 01:42:59,50
a sly grin spreads across SOMEONE's<Milo's> lips. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS571
01:43:29,00 --> 01:43:36,50
She and SOMEONE<Milo> swap warm smiles. Sunlight bathes her face. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS572
01:43:38,00 --> 01:43:46,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> beams. SOMEONE<Milo> skids around a corner, pulls into a curbside spot, and brakes hard. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS573
01:43:47,00 --> 01:43:53,50
She notices the police station across the street. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS574
01:43:51,00 --> 01:43:55,50
SOMEONE<Milo> gets out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS576
01:44:03,00 --> 01:44:08,50
In the station, SOMEONE<Nicole> wears handcuffs. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS577
01:44:17,00 --> 01:44:29,50
A female officer leads SOMEONE<Nicole> away as she glares at SOMEONE<Milo>. The bounty hunter signs a form and the cop at the desk shakes his head incredulously. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS578
01:44:30,00 --> 01:44:38,50
Pursing his mouth regretfully, SOMEONE<Milo> waves goodbye to the cop and ambles out. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS579
01:44:43,00 --> 01:44:55,50
Now, SOMEONE<Milo> strolls outside passing an officer and handcuffed teen on their way in. As the bounty hunter descends the stoop, the arresting officer from the parade swaggers up. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS580
01:44:59,00 --> 01:45:04,50
SOMEONE<Milo> eyes him with a half-smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS581
01:45:07,00 --> 01:45:13,50
SOMEONE<Milo> punches him. Inside, SOMEONE<Nicole> uses a phone. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS582
01:45:18,00 --> 01:45:23,50
Gelman shoves a cuffed SOMEONE<Milo> toward a holding cell. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS583
01:45:35,00 --> 01:45:47,50
The officers place the couple in side-by-side cells. SOMEONE<Milo> shrugs and faces his ex-wife through the bars. SOMEONE<Nicole> beams at him and shakes her head. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS584
01:45:48,00 --> 01:45:53,50
They share a smile. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS585
01:45:52,00 --> 01:46:00,50
They step up to the bars. SOMEONE<Nicole> reaches through them and wraps her arms around SOMEONE's<Milo's> neck. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS586
01:45:57,00 --> 01:46:02,50
They kiss passionately. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS587
01:45:59,00 --> 01:46:07,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> strokes her ex-husband's hair then cups the back of his head in both her hands. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS588
01:46:04,00 --> 01:46:10,50
Separating, they gaze into each other's eyes. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS589
01:46:13,00 --> 01:46:21,50
Grinning, SOMEONE<Nicole> massages his neck then wraps her arms around him once again. 

THE_BOUNTY_HUNTER_DVS590
01:46:18,00 --> 01:46:23,50
They embrace and share a deep kiss.
