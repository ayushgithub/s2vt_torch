THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS19
00:02:44,00 --> 00:02:51,50
Her square-jawed husband stares grimly at her over his reading glasses. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS20
00:03:08,00 --> 00:03:13,50
Breaking off his stare, he answers his cell. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS21
00:03:18,00 --> 00:03:24,50
Now, photos of his comatose wife fill a scrapbook. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS24
00:04:37,00 --> 00:04:42,50
At a posh house. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS25
00:05:04,00 --> 00:05:10,50
SOMEONE<Matt> sees SOMEONE<Scottie> hurl lawn chairs into a pool. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS26
00:05:31,00 --> 00:05:36,50
SOMEONE<Matt> briefly lowers the phone and glowers at it. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS27
00:05:36,00 --> 00:05:44,50
Now, in windy, overcast weather, a silver sedan drives through a middle class neighborhood. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS28
00:05:41,00 --> 00:05:46,50
As it passes, we glimpse SOMEONE<Scottie> riding shotgun. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS29
00:05:44,00 --> 00:05:52,50
The car arrives at a house. Now a round-faced woman with long, black hair opens its door. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS30
00:05:52,00 --> 00:05:56,50
SOMEONE<Matt> follows SOMEONE<Scottie> in. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS31
00:06:05,00 --> 00:06:13,50
The mother leads them into a sprawling cluttered living room where a chubby pre-teen girl watches TV. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS32
00:06:13,00 --> 00:06:23,50
Sharing her mother's round face and sullen pout, she faces her visitors. Her mother looks to them indignantly, hands on her hips. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS33
00:06:31,00 --> 00:06:36,50
SOMEONE<Matt> glances at SOMEONE's<Lani's> angry mother. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS34
00:06:48,00 --> 00:06:51,50
His daughter nods. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS35
00:06:51,00 --> 00:06:55,50
She nods emphatically. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS36
00:06:53,00 --> 00:06:57,50
SOMEONE<Matt> gives a shrug of the hand. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS37
00:06:55,00 --> 00:06:59,50
The mother faces her daughter inquiringly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS38
00:06:57,00 --> 00:07:03,50
SOMEONE<Lani> nods. Now the woman follows the visitors out to her porch. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS39
00:07:27,00 --> 00:07:35,50
She nods plainly. SOMEONE<Matt> wears a nonplussed smile, then walks his daughter to their car. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS40
00:07:44,00 --> 00:07:48,50
In a home office. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS41
00:07:49,00 --> 00:07:54,50
Later, he searches stacks of documents. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS42
00:07:59,00 --> 00:08:07,50
SOMEONE<Matt> views two portraits on a wall. One shows a Polynesian woman, the other a bearded Caucasian man. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS43
00:08:42,00 --> 00:08:49,50
SOMEONE<Matt> rubs his eyes. Now, he works in a metropolitan office. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS44
00:09:05,00 --> 00:09:10,50
A secretary looks in. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS45
00:09:08,00 --> 00:09:15,50
SOMEONE<Matt> covers a half-eaten salad. In a meeting room, he greets seven people in Hawaiian shirts. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS46
00:10:10,00 --> 00:10:19,50
As his cousins debate, SOMEONE<Matt> sits at the head of the conference table, his chin perched thoughtfully on his hand. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS47
00:10:16,00 --> 00:10:22,50
His gaze grows distant and his hand droops. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS48
00:10:25,00 --> 00:10:31,50
Later, he enters the hospital through sliding glass doors. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS49
00:10:36,00 --> 00:10:42,50
We peer down a square spiral stairwell. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS50
00:10:52,00 --> 00:10:57,50
SOMEONE<Matt> climbs flight after flight. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS51
00:11:03,00 --> 00:11:07,50
A balding doctor faces SOMEONE<Matt>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS52
00:11:21,00 --> 00:11:27,50
Hunched forward, SOMEONE<Matt> drops his hollow gaze. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS53
00:11:31,00 --> 00:11:36,50
His eyes glisten and he hangs his head. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS54
00:11:48,00 --> 00:11:55,50
SOMEONE<Matt> nods faintly, then screws his jaw to one side. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS55
00:12:24,00 --> 00:12:29,50
SOMEONE<Matt> leans back in his seat. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS56
00:12:55,00 --> 00:13:00,50
The doctor unhappily faces him. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS57
00:13:03,00 --> 00:13:12,50
At the end of a hallway, a door's window frames a view of SOMEONE<Matt> shambling closer, his arms hanging at his sides. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS58
00:13:10,00 --> 00:13:18,50
He pulls the door open and passes through with a thunderstruck expression on his face. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS59
00:13:15,00 --> 00:13:22,50
His gait is listless and steady as he makes his way past a few recovery rooms. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS60
00:13:20,00 --> 00:13:26,50
He passes behind a staffer on the phone at a nurse's station. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS61
00:13:23,00 --> 00:13:29,50
A distant doorway shows a nurse making a bed. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS62
00:13:28,00 --> 00:13:35,50
SOMEONE's<Matt's> expression grows woeful as he nears the far end of the ward. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS63
00:13:32,00 --> 00:13:38,50
He halts at a door to a private room and takes it in. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS64
00:13:36,00 --> 00:13:44,50
Entering, SOMEONE<Matt> finds an attractive dark-haired woman putting makeup on his gaunt wife. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS65
00:13:41,00 --> 00:13:46,50
A fit, pleasant-faced man sits nearby. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS66
00:14:19,00 --> 00:14:27,50
SOMEONE<Matt> mocks an optimistic smile, then looks pointedly in SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> direction. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS67
00:14:24,00 --> 00:14:29,50
Later, his car travels past a park. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS68
00:14:27,00 --> 00:14:33,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> rides shotgun as he makes a right turn into a parking lot. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS69
00:14:30,00 --> 00:14:35,50
They pass a sign that reads "Ocean Outrigger Club". 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS71
00:14:34,00 --> 00:14:42,50
Now in a baggy T-shirt and shorts, SOMEONE<Matt> sits on the sunny beach, gazing at the surf. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS72
00:14:39,00 --> 00:14:44,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> plays in shallow water near the shore. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS73
00:14:42,00 --> 00:14:48,50
Wearing a yellow swim mask, she undulates face down in the water. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS74
00:14:46,00 --> 00:14:53,50
Her long, brown hair clings like seaweed at her shoulders as she pops up for air. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS75
00:14:51,00 --> 00:14:56,50
SOMEONE<Matt> squints in the sunlight as he watches. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS76
00:14:53,00 --> 00:14:57,50
He looks away briefly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS78
00:14:56,00 --> 00:15:02,50
As SOMEONE<Scottie> does a handstand, her legs wobble at unsteady angles. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS80
00:15:01,00 --> 00:15:07,50
Now in a club restaurant, SOMEONE<Matt> watches her fondly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS81
00:15:14,00 --> 00:15:19,50
As she eats an ice cream sundae, SOMEONE wipes ice cream from her mouth with a napkin. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS82
00:15:34,00 --> 00:15:39,50
SOMEONE<Matt> looks down and gives a noncommittal shrug. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS83
00:15:36,00 --> 00:15:42,50
Lifting his gaze, he notices someone in the distance. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS84
00:15:39,00 --> 00:15:44,50
His expression darkens. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS85
00:15:41,00 --> 00:15:49,50
Behind his daughter, a muscular, blond man arrives at the bar with some friends. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS86
00:15:46,00 --> 00:15:50,50
He notices SOMEONE<Matt>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS87
00:15:49,00 --> 00:15:53,50
He approaches the table. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS88
00:16:26,00 --> 00:16:30,50
Troy shifts his wounded gaze. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS89
00:16:34,00 --> 00:16:40,50
Eating her sundae, SOMEONE<Scottie> squints up at Troy. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS90
00:16:37,00 --> 00:16:43,50
He glances at her, starts to go, but hesitates. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS91
00:17:07,00 --> 00:17:12,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> runs out. SOMEONE<Matt> glares at Troy. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS92
00:17:11,00 --> 00:17:15,50
He hurries after his daughter. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS93
00:17:51,00 --> 00:17:55,50
SOMEONE<Matt> leads his daughter back. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS94
00:17:53,00 --> 00:17:59,50
They pass the bar where Troy drinks beer with his friends. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS95
00:17:58,00 --> 00:18:02,50
The child flips him the bird. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS96
00:17:59,00 --> 00:18:11,50
Troy responds with a resigned nod. Now a plane soars into the sky. On a map, a dotted line traces a path from Oahu to the island of Hawaii. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS97
00:18:21,00 --> 00:18:28,50
On the plane, SOMEONE<Matt> and SOMEONE<Scottie> peer through a window at a verdant coastline. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS98
00:18:25,00 --> 00:18:34,50
At dusk, a red car passes terrain decorated with names spelled out in white stones. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS100
00:18:32,00 --> 00:18:39,50
At the wheel, SOMEONE<Matt> glances over at SOMEONE<Scottie>, who sleeps with her head leaned against the window. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS101
00:18:37,00 --> 00:18:43,50
Later in the night, the car's headlights cut through the darkness. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS102
00:18:41,00 --> 00:18:45,50
It turns up a driveway, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS103
00:18:42,00 --> 00:18:48,50
passing a sign that reads "Hawaii Pacific Institute". 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS104
00:18:46,00 --> 00:18:52,50
Indoors, three figures step into view in a long corridor. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS105
00:18:50,00 --> 00:18:55,50
Overhead fluorescents flicker on. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS106
00:18:52,00 --> 00:18:57,50
A woman leads SOMEONE<Matt> and SOMEONE<Scottie> forward. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS107
00:18:54,00 --> 00:19:00,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> hurries ahead and knocks eagerly on a door. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS108
00:19:00,00 --> 00:19:06,50
It opens, revealing a sleepy, disheveled teen. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS109
00:19:07,00 --> 00:19:14,50
The supervisor wearily leads the visitors down the hall to another door. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS110
00:19:14,00 --> 00:19:21,50
A partition slides down, revealing a groggy teen girl putting on glasses. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS111
00:19:29,00 --> 00:19:35,50
Now, in the darkness, the dorm supervisor uses a flashlight to lead 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS112
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:37,50
SOMEONE<Matt> and SOMEONE<Scottie> down a long stairway. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS113
00:19:35,00 --> 00:19:40,50
They pass through a chain link gate to a driving range. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS114
00:19:43,00 --> 00:19:48,50
Two teens flee, one falls. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS115
00:19:53,00 --> 00:19:58,50
The girls stagger gripping golf clubs. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS116
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:04,50
SOMEONE<Alex> grins drunkenly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS117
00:20:09,00 --> 00:20:15,50
Grinning, SOMEONE<Alex> points at her father with her golf club. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS118
00:20:14,00 --> 00:20:19,50
She turns away and flings it. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS119
00:20:20,00 --> 00:20:25,50
Now, SOMEONE<Matt> and his daughters arrive at home. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS120
00:20:42,00 --> 00:20:46,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> obeys. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS121
00:20:44,00 --> 00:20:50,50
SOMEONE<Matt> carries a passed out SOMEONE<Alex> down a hallway upstairs. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS122
00:20:47,00 --> 00:20:54,50
Her arms hug him around the neck and her head rests against his shoulder. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS123
00:20:51,00 --> 00:20:57,50
SOMEONE<Matt> brings her into a bedroom and lays her down. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS124
00:20:55,00 --> 00:21:00,50
The teen stirs sleepily. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS125
00:20:57,00 --> 00:21:03,50
SOMEONE<Matt> guides her raised knees down and covers her with a quilt. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS126
00:21:01,00 --> 00:21:08,50
Heading out, he pauses at the door and glances solemnly back at her. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS127
00:21:08,00 --> 00:21:20,50
His expression growing resigned, he leaves and shuts the door. In the morning, SOMEONE<Matt> transfers scrambled eggs from a pan onto a plate with toast. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS128
00:21:20,00 --> 00:21:26,50
He sets the meal on a table for SOMEONE<Scottie>. She balks. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS129
00:21:25,00 --> 00:21:29,50
She pushes the plate away. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS130
00:21:30,00 --> 00:21:36,50
As SOMEONE<Matt> takes the plate from the table, SOMEONE<Alex> shuffles in. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS131
00:21:35,00 --> 00:21:44,50
Without meeting his gaze, the teen takes a cola from the refrigerator, sits at the table, and slurps sullenly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS132
00:21:42,00 --> 00:21:47,50
SOMEONE<Matt> regards her with a disapproving smirk. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS133
00:22:07,00 --> 00:22:12,50
SOMEONE<Matt> tilts his head sheepishly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS134
00:22:31,00 --> 00:22:40,50
SOMEONE<Matt> brings her the untouched breakfast. SOMEONE<Alex> glares at him, glances at the plate, and leaves with an indignant sneer. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS135
00:22:38,00 --> 00:22:44,50
SOMEONE follows her outside and finds her on her cellphone, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS136
00:22:41,00 --> 00:22:47,50
seated at the edge of an in-ground pool littered with leaves. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS137
00:23:11,00 --> 00:23:17,50
SOMEONE<Matt> steps away, picks up a skimmer, and scoops some of the leaves out. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS138
00:23:22,00 --> 00:23:28,50
Clad in a bikini, the teen ends her call. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS139
00:23:54,00 --> 00:23:59,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> wags her bottom. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS140
00:24:04,00 --> 00:24:10,50
Pouting, SOMEONE<Scottie> flips her father the bird and goes inside. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS141
00:24:19,00 --> 00:24:23,50
SOMEONE<Alex> gets in the pool. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS142
00:24:42,00 --> 00:24:47,50
Treading water, SOMEONE<Alex> stares at her father. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS143
00:24:47,00 --> 00:24:51,50
She looks away, stricken. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS144
00:25:03,00 --> 00:25:10,50
Blinking back tears, SOMEONE<Alex> meets his imploring gaze. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS145
00:25:13,00 --> 00:25:19,50
Surrounding by dead floating leaves, the teen looks away. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS146
00:25:18,00 --> 00:25:24,50
She sinks down beneath the water and holds her head in her hands. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS147
00:25:22,00 --> 00:25:28,50
Large air bubbles escape her gaping mouth as her body shakes with sobs. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS148
00:25:26,00 --> 00:25:32,50
Her features contort fiercely and she swims through the water. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS149
00:25:30,00 --> 00:25:36,50
SOMEONE<Matt> walks alongside her as her head emerges. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS150
00:25:36,00 --> 00:25:42,50
She climbs out and buries her face in a colorful towel. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS151
00:25:40,00 --> 00:25:45,50
Her father approaches with a compassionate frown. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS152
00:25:51,00 --> 00:25:57,50
Wheeling around, SOMEONE<Alex> finds him with his arms spread open to her. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS153
00:25:55,00 --> 00:25:59,50
She leaves him. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS154
00:25:56,00 --> 00:26:02,50
Her father watches her go with a heavy gaze. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS156
00:25:59,00 --> 00:26:08,50
fully dressed and curled up on a sofa, SOMEONE<Alex> faces its back and rests her chin on her folded arms. SOMEONE<Matt> walks in. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS158
00:26:10,00 --> 00:26:14,50
The girl blinks thoughtfully 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS159
00:26:12,00 --> 00:26:17,50
as her father takes a seat opposite her, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS160
00:26:15,00 --> 00:26:19,50
She curls her neck to look at him. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS161
00:26:35,00 --> 00:26:41,50
SOMEONE<Alex> sits up, then scoots around to face him fully. SOMEONE<Matt> blinks quizzically. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS162
00:27:18,00 --> 00:27:23,50
He cocks his head. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS164
00:28:03,00 --> 00:28:07,50
SOMEONE<Matt> wears a confounded gaze. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS165
00:28:06,00 --> 00:28:10,50
He shifts in his chair. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS166
00:28:34,00 --> 00:28:39,50
Looking away, SOMEONE<Matt> shakes his head. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS167
00:28:37,00 --> 00:28:42,50
He springs to his feet and paces. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS168
00:28:40,00 --> 00:28:44,50
The betrayed husband halts. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS169
00:28:41,00 --> 00:28:46,50
His back to SOMEONE<Alex>, then turns. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS170
00:29:10,00 --> 00:29:14,50
SOMEONE's chest rises and 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS172
00:29:12,00 --> 00:29:17,50
He registers a hint of a nod. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS173
00:29:23,00 --> 00:29:27,50
He has helpless shrug. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS174
00:29:24,00 --> 00:29:28,50
He has hands on his hips. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS175
00:29:25,00 --> 00:29:29,50
SOMEONE<Matt> turns away and paces restlessly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS177
00:29:29,00 --> 00:29:35,50
His hands curl into fists then release. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS178
00:29:32,00 --> 00:29:38,50
Facing SOMEONE<Alex>, he rubs his chin and nose. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS179
00:29:39,00 --> 00:29:46,50
He goes out onto the porch and steps into a pair of soft-soled shoes. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS180
00:29:43,00 --> 00:29:50,50
He hops and hobbles as he pulls them over his heels one at a time. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS181
00:29:47,00 --> 00:29:52,50
Clambering down to his driveway, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS182
00:29:49,00 --> 00:29:53,50
SOMEONE<Matt> breaks into a run. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS183
00:29:51,00 --> 00:29:58,50
The family man races out of a cul-de-sac and reaches a narrow, rain-soaked road. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS184
00:29:55,00 --> 00:30:03,50
He follows it at a sprint, his brow furrowed and his arms pumping furiously. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS185
00:30:01,00 --> 00:30:06,50
Running at a stilted, awkward gait, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS186
00:30:03,00 --> 00:30:10,50
he reaches a hairpin curve and follows it onto a street canopied with lush trees. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS187
00:30:08,00 --> 00:30:14,50
It leads him to a neighborhood nestled by verdant foothills. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS189
00:30:13,00 --> 00:30:20,50
Arriving at a two-story house, he passes a little brown goat on his way up the driveway. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS190
00:30:17,00 --> 00:30:25,50
Through a window in a cluttered kitchen, we watch him arrive at a door where he lets himself in. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS191
00:30:34,00 --> 00:30:40,50
He ventures further into his friend's house. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS192
00:30:42,00 --> 00:30:47,50
SOMEONE<Kai> emerges on an upstairs landing. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS193
00:31:15,00 --> 00:31:18,50
They join SOMEONE<Matt>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS194
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:32,50
SOMEONE<Kai> stares wide-eyed at SOMEONE<Matt>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS195
00:31:29,00 --> 00:31:34,50
SOMEONE<Mark> looks away regretfully. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS196
00:31:54,00 --> 00:31:58,50
SOMEONE<Kai> heaves a breath. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS197
00:31:56,00 --> 00:32:00,50
SOMEONE<Mark> fidgets with his wedding ring. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS198
00:32:35,00 --> 00:32:39,50
SOMEONE<Mark> takes a seat and nods. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS199
00:32:41,00 --> 00:32:47,50
SOMEONE<Matt> screws his jaw to one side and faces SOMEONE<Kai>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS200
00:33:17,00 --> 00:33:23,50
As SOMEONE<Kai> sinks down in a chair, SOMEONE's<Matt's> gaze softened. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS201
00:33:21,00 --> 00:33:26,50
He shrugs a hand helplessly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS202
00:33:23,00 --> 00:33:31,50
SOMEONE<Kai> doubles over, burying her face in her hands as her husband looks on sympathetically. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS203
00:33:28,00 --> 00:33:35,50
SOMEONE<Matt> pulls a chair out from a nearby table and sits facing his friends. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS204
00:33:32,00 --> 00:33:38,50
He leans forward, his elbows on his knees. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS205
00:33:35,00 --> 00:33:41,50
His gaze fixes on SOMEONE<Kai>, then drops morosely. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS206
00:33:56,00 --> 00:34:02,50
SOMEONE's<Matt's> eyes glisten and he gives a shaky nod. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS207
00:33:59,00 --> 00:34:04,50
He swallows hard and blinks back tears. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS208
00:34:02,00 --> 00:34:09,50
With a resigned smirk, his gaze toggles between SOMEONE<Kai> and SOMEONE<Mark>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS209
00:34:15,00 --> 00:34:19,50
SOMEONE<Matt> leaves. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS210
00:34:16,00 --> 00:34:21,50
As SOMEONE<Kai> rocks herself, her arms folded, SOMEONE<Mark> gazes remorsefully after his friend. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS213
00:34:22,00 --> 00:34:28,50
SOMEONE<Matt> heads down the sun-dappled driveway past the goat. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS214
00:34:28,00 --> 00:34:32,50
SOMEONE<Mark> catches up to him. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS215
00:34:35,00 --> 00:34:41,50
SOMEONE<Matt> gives a small nod and goes. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS216
00:34:38,00 --> 00:34:42,50
SOMEONE<Mark> heads back toward his house. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS218
00:34:43,00 --> 00:34:48,50
Now, on a bridge stretching over a sparkling stream, SOMEONE<Matt> weeps into his hand. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS219
00:34:51,00 --> 00:34:55,50
He wipes his face. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS220
00:34:55,00 --> 00:35:02,50
Keeping his head down, he wipes his eyes and continues across the bridge. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS221
00:34:59,00 --> 00:35:06,50
Now he hikes wearily across a healthy lawn bordered by a stone wall. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS223
00:35:07,00 --> 00:35:12,50
The stone one meets a second wall of painted cinder block, that's stained along the top with mold. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS224
00:35:09,00 --> 00:35:15,50
SOMEONE<Matt> arrives at the cul-de-sac leading to his driveway. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS226
00:35:14,00 --> 00:35:19,50
He heads toward his home, passing lush flowering shrubs. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS227
00:35:17,00 --> 00:35:24,50
SOMEONE<Matt> turns. He approaches the pool area where his daughters share a lounge chair. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS228
00:35:21,00 --> 00:35:26,50
A teen boy reclines in a chair beside them. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS229
00:35:30,00 --> 00:35:36,50
SOMEONE<Matt> extends a hand. SOMEONE<Sid> bounds up and clasps it. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS230
00:35:34,00 --> 00:35:40,50
He throws an arm around SOMEONE<Matt> in a brotherly hug. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS231
00:35:38,00 --> 00:35:43,50
SOMEONE<Matt> faces SOMEONE<Alex>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS232
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:06,50
SOMEONE<Matt> eyes the teen boy with a skeptical frown. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS233
00:36:05,00 --> 00:36:09,50
SOMEONE<Sid> grins and shrugs. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS234
00:36:06,00 --> 00:36:16,50
Now, a man's aging hands hold a document headed "Advance Healthcare Directive". The reader, a man with a grey buzz cut, scowls. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS235
00:36:21,00 --> 00:36:26,50
SOMEONE<Scott> tosses it down bitterly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS236
00:37:28,00 --> 00:37:33,50
SOMEONE<Matt> subdues a glare. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS237
00:37:47,00 --> 00:37:51,50
SOMEONE's<Scott's> chin quivers. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS238
00:37:51,00 --> 00:37:59,50
Getting to his feet, the older man steps away from the table in his beige knee socks and sandals. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS239
00:37:57,00 --> 00:38:07,50
Wearing a white tee tucked into his khaki shorts, he keeps his back to SOMEONE<Matt>, SOMEONE<Alex>, and SOMEONE<Sid>, who watch him halt on the grass. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS240
00:38:06,00 --> 00:38:14,50
SOMEONE's<Scott's> mouth twists in a repressed sob and he rubs his lips back into a stoic line. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS241
00:38:13,00 --> 00:38:18,50
His chest rises and falls and he bows his head. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS242
00:38:16,00 --> 00:38:21,50
Creasing his lips, he lifts his mournful gaze. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS243
00:38:19,00 --> 00:38:26,50
Later, inside, SOMEONE<Scott> gently leads a silver-haired woman by the hand. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS244
00:38:23,00 --> 00:38:30,50
She wears a vacant, confused expression as he takes her down a hallway 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS245
00:38:27,00 --> 00:38:33,50
to a living room where the three visitors wait. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS246
00:38:30,00 --> 00:38:35,50
SOMEONE<Sid> remains seated at the far end of the room. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS247
00:38:33,00 --> 00:38:38,50
SOMEONE<Matt> and SOMEONE<Alex> respectfully get to their feet. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS248
00:38:42,00 --> 00:38:46,50
He kisses her cheek. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS249
00:39:03,00 --> 00:39:08,50
Now standing, SOMEONE<Sid> smiles and waves. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS250
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:10,50
SOMEONE<Scott> eyes him, then faces his wife. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS251
00:39:47,00 --> 00:39:52,50
SOMEONE<Scott> storms over to SOMEONE<Sid>, who takes a step back. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS252
00:39:58,00 --> 00:40:02,50
SOMEONE<Scott> punches him. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS253
00:39:59,00 --> 00:40:05,50
Now, in SOMEONE's<Matt's> car, SOMEONE<Sid> holds frozen peas over his eye. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS254
00:40:16,00 --> 00:40:20,50
SOMEONE<Sid> shows his black eye. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS255
00:40:18,00 --> 00:40:23,50
SOMEONE<Alex> touches him gently. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS256
00:40:32,00 --> 00:40:36,50
SOMEONE<Matt> pulls over. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS257
00:40:33,00 --> 00:40:39,50
He wheels around, pointing a finger harshly at SOMEONE<Sid>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS258
00:40:42,00 --> 00:40:47,50
Glaring, SOMEONE<Matt> withdraws his hand and faces SOMEONE<Alex>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS259
00:40:52,00 --> 00:40:57,50
SOMEONE<Matt> contritely lowers his gaze. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS260
00:41:19,00 --> 00:41:25,50
SOMEONE<Matt> turns away from the teen and slumps forward morosely. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS261
00:41:22,00 --> 00:41:27,50
SOMEONE<Alex> observes her father with a concerned gaze. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS262
00:41:25,00 --> 00:41:31,50
Unfastening her seat belt, she leans forward and hugs his seat. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS263
00:41:35,00 --> 00:41:41,50
SOMEONE<Matt> raises an eyebrow and blinks at his daughter. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS264
00:41:39,00 --> 00:41:43,50
She climbs up. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS265
00:41:40,00 --> 00:41:46,50
Now, the car travels along a road overlooking the ocean. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS266
00:42:10,00 --> 00:42:17,50
SOMEONE<Matt> the stops the car across from a pleasant mid-century home with a copper turtle on the gate post. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS267
00:42:37,00 --> 00:42:47,50
SOMEONE<Matt> and SOMEONE<Alex> duck down in their seats and discreetly cover their faces. A pickup truck passes by. SOMEONE<Sid> hunches down as well. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS268
00:42:44,00 --> 00:42:48,50
All three straighten. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS269
00:42:57,00 --> 00:43:06,50
Working his jaw, SOMEONE<Matt> briefly returns his vulnerable gaze to the stranger's house, then droops his head forward. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS270
00:43:03,00 --> 00:43:07,50
Seen from a distance, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS271
00:43:05,00 --> 00:43:10,50
his car's break lights blink on and he pulls away. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS272
00:43:08,00 --> 00:43:14,50
The sedan follows the winding residential road downhill. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS274
00:43:13,00 --> 00:43:21,50
traveling through another neighborhood, the car passes a large, beautifully landscaped house on a corner. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS275
00:43:26,00 --> 00:43:30,50
The car backs up. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS276
00:43:27,00 --> 00:43:35,50
A real estate sign stands posted outside the home's fence of rainbow-shaped rails. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS277
00:43:36,00 --> 00:43:45,50
The real estate sign lists the name SOMEONE<Brian> Speer and shows a happy photo of a beady-eyed man with a toothy grin. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS279
00:43:49,00 --> 00:43:55,50
At home, trophies, medals, and beaded lace fill a set of shelves. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS280
00:43:52,00 --> 00:43:59,50
A central photo shows a smiling SOMEONE<Elizabeth> wearing a race number on her shirt. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS283
00:44:16,00 --> 00:44:20,50
SOMEONE<Matt> uses the phone. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS284
00:44:33,00 --> 00:44:39,50
Sitting in a day bed with a bottle of Jameson Irish Whisky at his side, SOMEONE<Matt> takes a steadying breath and ends the call. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS286
00:44:40,00 --> 00:44:45,50
As he turns off a lamp on a stand, the scene cuts to black. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS288
00:44:44,00 --> 00:44:52,50
Now, clouds drift fast across the sky as dawn breaks at a sped up pace. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS289
00:44:49,00 --> 00:44:56,50
Two mountains frame a distant view of fast motion traffic on a highway. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS290
00:44:53,00 --> 00:44:59,50
Just off a coast dotted with high-rises, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS291
00:44:56,00 --> 00:45:03,50
teams of rowers paddle canoes along the rippling turquoise water. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS292
00:45:00,00 --> 00:45:04,50
Under a now bright sky, light traffic dots a multi-lane road. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS294
00:45:04,00 --> 00:45:11,50
In the city, an American flag and a Hawaiian state flag hang posted on either side of a building's entrance. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS296
00:45:11,00 --> 00:45:19,50
In the hospital, a pair of windowed doors show SOMEONE<Matt> arriving with his daughters in tow. He opens one door for them. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS298
00:45:18,00 --> 00:45:22,50
They lead the way into the ward. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS299
00:45:24,00 --> 00:45:31,50
His daughters gaze after him as he enters SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> room alone. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS300
00:45:28,00 --> 00:45:36,50
SOMEONE<Matt> shuts the door behind him, then draws a curtain covering the windows to the ward floor. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS301
00:45:34,00 --> 00:45:38,50
He faces his wife. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS302
00:45:49,00 --> 00:45:55,50
He glares down at his comatose wife and circles the bed. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS303
00:46:06,00 --> 00:46:12,50
His wife lies slack-jawed and motionless. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS304
00:46:30,00 --> 00:46:35,50
Leaning close, SOMEONE<Matt> holds an anguished stare. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS305
00:46:32,00 --> 00:46:38,50
He straightens, picking up a teddy bear from the bed. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS306
00:46:35,00 --> 00:46:41,50
SOMEONE<Matt> starts to gesture with it, then hurls it across the room. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS307
00:46:42,00 --> 00:46:48,50
Catching his breath, he smooths his graying hair and steps away. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS308
00:46:52,00 --> 00:46:57,50
SOMEONE<Matt> draws himself up and leaves the room. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS309
00:46:55,00 --> 00:47:01,50
A regal chipped frame displays a photo of a little girl with golden hair. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS310
00:46:59,00 --> 00:47:06,50
On a windowsill, a varsity letter P stands propped against a diploma. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS311
00:47:03,00 --> 00:47:09,50
Another photo shows a radiantly smiling SOMEONE<Elizabeth>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS312
00:47:12,00 --> 00:47:18,50
SOMEONE<Alex> ambles into the hospital room, her eyes fixed on her mother. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS313
00:47:16,00 --> 00:47:23,50
Reaching the foot of the bed, she glances at SOMEONE<Matt>, then takes another step closer. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS314
00:47:21,00 --> 00:47:28,50
Her comatose mother's chest rises and falls under her tracheostomy tube. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS315
00:48:06,00 --> 00:48:10,50
He spanks her. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS316
00:48:17,00 --> 00:48:21,50
He hustles SOMEONE<Scottie> out of the room. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS317
00:48:42,00 --> 00:48:48,50
SOMEONE's<Alex's> glistening eyes glance between her father and mother. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS318
00:48:45,00 --> 00:48:48,50
She turns to face to bed. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS320
00:49:17,00 --> 00:49:25,50
Later, SOMEONE<Alex> sits next to SOMEONE<Sid>, while SOMEONE<Matt> reads in a chair facing the foot of the bed. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS321
00:49:22,00 --> 00:49:27,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> leads a taller girl into the room. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS322
00:49:34,00 --> 00:49:38,50
SOMEONE<Sid> gives a halfhearted wave. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS323
00:49:36,00 --> 00:49:42,50
SOMEONE<Reina> glances around, then joins her friend at SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> bedside. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS324
00:49:41,00 --> 00:49:45,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> nods. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS325
00:50:29,00 --> 00:50:33,50
SOMEONE<Reina> exits. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS326
00:50:30,00 --> 00:50:35,50
SOMEONE<Alex> eyes her sister. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS327
00:50:52,00 --> 00:50:57,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> points to SOMEONE<Alex>, who guiltily averts her gaze. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS328
00:50:56,00 --> 00:51:01,50
SOMEONE grabs his cellphone from a counter, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS329
00:50:58,00 --> 00:51:02,50
then leans forward heavily. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS330
00:51:00,00 --> 00:51:06,50
The display indicates an incoming call from Gold Coast Real Estate. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS331
00:51:03,00 --> 00:51:09,50
SOMEONE<Matt> shows the cellphone to SOMEONE<Alex> and her eyes widen. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS332
00:51:07,00 --> 00:51:12,50
She grabs it from him and crosses the room. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS333
00:51:30,00 --> 00:51:33,50
She hangs up. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS334
00:51:41,00 --> 00:51:46,50
Nodding softly, SOMEONE<Matt> shifts his thoughtful gaze. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS335
00:51:45,00 --> 00:51:50,50
Now, over a dozen cars fill the King's driveway. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS336
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:55,50
Inside, using chopsticks, people fill their plates with crabs and sushi. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS337
00:51:53,00 --> 00:52:00,50
SOMEONE<Mark> and SOMEONE<Kai> peruse the buffet table while other guests convene in the next room. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS338
00:51:57,00 --> 00:52:03,50
A woman with short, grey hair chats with some friends. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS339
00:52:02,00 --> 00:52:09,50
In the kitchen, SOMEONE<Matt> gazes off sullenly. He takes a sip of scotch. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS340
00:52:07,00 --> 00:52:14,50
A teenage boy enters the room and approaches him from behind. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS341
00:52:26,00 --> 00:52:30,50
He takes another sip of his drink. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS343
00:52:54,00 --> 00:53:00,50
SOMEONE<Matt> shakes his head, struggling to retain his composure. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS344
00:53:01,00 --> 00:53:08,50
He chuckles to himself but quickly succumbs to sobs. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS345
00:53:05,00 --> 00:53:09,50
The others look on mournfully. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS346
00:53:24,00 --> 00:53:28,50
He wipes his nose. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS347
00:53:38,00 --> 00:53:43,50
That evening, he crosses the driveway. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS348
00:53:43,00 --> 00:53:49,50
He waves to the last departing car as he watches it drive off. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS349
00:53:47,00 --> 00:53:53,50
A breeze blows through the bushes flanking the end of the driveway. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS350
00:53:50,00 --> 00:53:56,50
Heading back for the house, SOMEONE<Matt> shuffles across the lawn. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS351
00:53:56,00 --> 00:54:02,50
He drops to his hands and knees, hanging his head low to the ground. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS352
00:54:02,00 --> 00:54:11,50
Sitting back on his ankles, the weary husband rests his hands on his thighs and gazes off pensively. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS353
00:54:11,00 --> 00:54:17,50
Now, he sits in his office over a load of paperwork. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS354
00:54:36,00 --> 00:54:41,50
They notice the recorder in his hand. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS355
00:55:06,00 --> 00:55:11,50
SOMEONE<Alex> lowers her gaze and bites her bottom lip. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS356
00:55:17,00 --> 00:55:26,50
Now, as a Hawaiian Airlines jet takes off, the image dissolves to the map of Hawaii with a dashed line leading from Oahu to Kauai. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS357
00:55:24,00 --> 00:55:29,50
On the flight, SOMEONE<Alex> chats with SOMEONE<Scottie>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS358
00:55:26,00 --> 00:55:30,50
SOMEONE<Sid> listens to music. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS359
00:55:28,00 --> 00:55:33,50
Across the aisle, SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE's black eye. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS361
00:55:33,00 --> 00:55:40,50
He turns his wry gaze away and awkwardly finds himself face to face with the large goateed passenger to his left. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS362
00:55:37,00 --> 00:55:44,50
SOMEONE<Matt> abruptly faces forward. Later, outside an airport, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS363
00:55:42,00 --> 00:55:48,50
a friendly-faced guy comes hurrying over. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS364
00:56:43,00 --> 00:56:50,50
Now, a hula girl doll bobbles on the dashboard of a moving vehicle. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS365
00:56:49,00 --> 00:56:55,50
The white open-top jeep cruises down a beachside road. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS366
00:56:53,00 --> 00:57:00,50
The kids ride in back with the wind in their hair. SOMEONE<Matt> and his cousin sit up front. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS367
00:57:10,00 --> 00:57:17,50
The white jeep makes a left turn off the coastal highway onto a side street, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS368
00:57:14,00 --> 00:57:20,50
then heads down a dirt road bordered by a wooden fence. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS369
00:57:17,00 --> 00:57:23,50
A distant mountain range spans the horizon. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS370
00:57:23,00 --> 00:57:30,50
Later, SOMEONE<Matt> chains a metal gate to a wooden post and returns to the jeep, beyond which a herd of cows grazes in a field. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS372
00:57:37,00 --> 00:57:42,50
A few cows stand in their way. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS373
00:57:39,00 --> 00:57:46,50
Later, the jeep travels a winding dirt path wide enough for only one vehicle. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS374
00:57:44,00 --> 00:57:49,50
Our view pulls back to encompass the landscape, which includes lush trees and rolling hills. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS376
00:57:50,00 --> 00:57:56,50
Heading uphill, the jeep jostles its passengers. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS377
00:57:54,00 --> 00:58:01,50
It reaches the summit of the tree-lined road and rolls to a stop. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS378
00:57:59,00 --> 00:58:04,50
SOMEONE<Matt> steps out. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS379
00:58:07,00 --> 00:58:11,50
The others climb out as well. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS380
00:58:11,00 --> 00:58:16,50
SOMEONE<Matt> shuts his passenger door. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS382
00:58:17,00 --> 00:58:22,50
As the group continues up the dirt road, our view turns to follow them. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS383
00:58:19,00 --> 00:58:27,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> runs out on a grassy ridge past the corner of an old stone foundation. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS384
00:58:27,00 --> 00:58:32,50
They all stop on the scenic overlook. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS385
00:58:34,00 --> 00:58:40,50
Below lies a majestic cove of wild undeveloped land. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS386
00:59:30,00 --> 00:59:35,50
The tide rolls in gently on the distant beach. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS387
00:59:40,00 --> 00:59:46,50
SOMEONE<Matt> glances at SOMEONE<Scottie> with a faint smile, then sighs. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS390
00:59:50,00 --> 00:59:55,50
Hovering over the group, our view turns away from the grassy ridge, for a final glimpse of the vast cove and its pristine surroundings. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS393
01:00:01,00 --> 01:00:06,50
Now, we pull back from a faux Italian statue of Neptune towering over the center of a fountain, with scalloped ridges evocative of an oyster shell. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS395
01:00:06,00 --> 01:00:12,50
The jeep drives by, following a bend in the road. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS396
01:00:11,00 --> 01:00:18,50
We drive past a sign for Sandpiper Village, another for Paniolo, then a golf course abutting a housing community. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS398
01:00:18,00 --> 01:00:26,50
Riding in the passenger seat, SOMEONE<Matt> holds his forehead as he absently gazes out his window. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS399
01:00:23,00 --> 01:00:29,50
The jeep arrives at a hotel, driving past a fountain near the entrance. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS400
01:00:27,00 --> 01:00:32,50
Later, at the front desk, SOMEONE<Matt> folds up his wallet. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS401
01:00:39,00 --> 01:00:44,50
A clerk looks up the name on his computer. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS403
01:00:52,00 --> 01:00:58,50
Now, at the beach, he ambles over to a blanket where Alexandra suns her back and SOMEONE<Scottie> lies with her head on SOMEONE's<Sid's> shoulder. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS404
01:00:55,00 --> 01:01:00,50
Her bikini top filled with lumps of sand, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS405
01:01:12,00 --> 01:01:18,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> wanders over to the water to shake out the sand. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS406
01:01:15,00 --> 01:01:22,50
SOMEONE<Alex> reaches behind her back and fastens her own top as her father takes a seat. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS407
01:01:39,00 --> 01:01:47,50
Later, strolling the beach, SOMEONE<Matt> shows SOMEONE<Alex> a photo of SOMEONE<Brian> Speer from a real estate ad. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS408
01:02:04,00 --> 01:02:12,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> and SOMEONE<Sid> trail behind SOMEONE<Alex> and SOMEONE<Matt> as they make their way down the wet sand. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS410
01:02:12,00 --> 01:02:17,50
We draw back to take in a wide stretch of the shoreline and the misty mountain peaks beyond. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS411
01:02:38,00 --> 01:02:43,50
A wide, low-limbed tree shades our view. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS412
01:03:00,00 --> 01:03:09,50
The sun sets behind the watery horizon as the foursome continues along the shore toward a distant resort, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS413
01:03:06,00 --> 01:03:11,50
the low waves lapping gently at their ankles. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS414
01:03:09,00 --> 01:03:15,50
Now, an adults only menu pops up on a TV screen. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS415
01:03:13,00 --> 01:03:18,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> mans the remote control as her family finishes dinner in their hotel suite. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS417
01:03:22,00 --> 01:03:26,50
SOMEONE<Alex> snatches the remote. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS418
01:03:59,00 --> 01:04:05,50
Flailing her arms, SOMEONE<Scottie> prances out of the room. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS419
01:04:16,00 --> 01:04:23,50
The frustrated father glances aside, then meets SOMEONE's<Alex's> steady gaze. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS421
01:04:22,00 --> 01:04:28,50
SOMEONE<Matt> steps out from a bathroom and shuts off the light. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS422
01:04:26,00 --> 01:04:32,50
He plops down on his unmade bed and sits alone in the dark. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS423
01:04:33,00 --> 01:04:40,50
Now, SOMEONE<Matt> opens a door and steps into the suite's dark living room. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS424
01:04:39,00 --> 01:04:47,50
Shuffling through the shadows, he pauses by a sofa and juts his head forward. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS426
01:04:47,00 --> 01:04:52,50
Lying under a blanket on a fold out bed, SOMEONE<Sid> rolls his head to look up at SOMEONE<Matt>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS428
01:05:04,00 --> 01:05:10,50
SOMEONE<Matt> stares at him, then shifts his frustrated gaze and nods. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS429
01:05:07,00 --> 01:05:12,50
He switches on a lamp near SOMEONE's<Sid's> pillow. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS430
01:05:10,00 --> 01:05:15,50
The teen shuts his eyes, frowning against the light. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS431
01:05:13,00 --> 01:05:17,50
SOMEONE<Matt> shakes his head. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS432
01:05:14,00 --> 01:05:19,50
He shuffles around the fold out bed, shrugs, and takes a seat. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS435
01:05:35,00 --> 01:05:39,50
SOMEONE<Matt> nods thoughtfully. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS436
01:07:03,00 --> 01:07:08,50
SOMEONE<Matt> lifts his chin. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS439
01:07:18,00 --> 01:07:22,50
SOMEONE<Sid> settles into his pillows. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS440
01:07:20,00 --> 01:07:26,50
SOMEONE<Matt> gives a thoughtful nod and regards the teen. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS441
01:07:24,00 --> 01:07:28,50
SOMEONE<Sid> offers a kind smile. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS442
01:07:26,00 --> 01:07:31,50
SOMEONE<Matt> glances down ponderously, nods again, and trains a warm gaze on the boy. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS444
01:07:36,00 --> 01:07:41,50
SOMEONE<Sid> takes a deep breath. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS445
01:07:42,00 --> 01:07:48,50
SOMEONE<Sid> hunkers down and pulls his blanket up to his chin. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS446
01:07:48,00 --> 01:07:53,50
The lamp blinks off and the scene cuts to black. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS447
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:58,50
Now, on a misty morning, the waves crawl up on the sandy beach beneath an overcast sky. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS448
01:07:55,00 --> 01:08:06,50
In a faded black t-shirt, SOMEONE<Matt> jogs along the shoreline. He moves with a rhythmic, purposeful gait, glancing occasionally over the slate-hued water. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS449
01:08:04,00 --> 01:08:09,50
Some distance ahead, another jogger approaches. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS450
01:08:07,00 --> 01:08:11,50
SOMEONE<Matt> notices dismissively. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS452
01:08:11,00 --> 01:08:16,50
As the lanky figure draws near, we recognize SOMEONE's face. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS453
01:08:14,00 --> 01:08:20,50
The real estate agent gives a sportsmanlike wave as he passes. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS454
01:08:17,00 --> 01:08:24,50
SOMEONE<Matt> returns the gesture, then halts and stares back at him. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS455
01:08:21,00 --> 01:08:27,50
His brow knits and he takes off after SOMEONE<Brian>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS456
01:08:24,00 --> 01:08:31,50
He quickens his pace, struggling to catch up to his wife's lover. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS457
01:08:28,00 --> 01:08:34,50
But SOMEONE's<Brian's> long-legged stride keeps him several yards ahead. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS458
01:08:31,00 --> 01:08:38,50
SOMEONE<Matt> works his way up to a sprint, staring at SOMEONE<Brian> through wild eyes. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS459
01:08:36,00 --> 01:08:43,50
The real estate agent turns and trots up the beach toward a row of hedges. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS460
01:08:40,00 --> 01:08:47,50
SOMEONE<Matt> pauses, watching him run toward a gate-like gap in the greenery. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS461
01:08:50,00 --> 01:08:57,50
As SOMEONE<Brian> passes out of sight, the wronged husband dashes toward the hedge line. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS462
01:08:55,00 --> 01:09:02,50
Glancing over his shoulder, he slows, then quickens his pace to a reckless scramble. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS463
01:09:00,00 --> 01:09:06,50
He arrives at the hedge and ducks behind it near the gap. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS464
01:09:03,00 --> 01:09:11,50
Seen from inside, the gap shows SOMEONE<Matt> darting across to take cover behind the opposite hedge. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS465
01:09:09,00 --> 01:09:15,50
He peeks up over the top and finds SOMEONE climbing steps 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS466
01:09:13,00 --> 01:09:20,50
to a one-story home with a broad roof, a full-length porch, and a sprawling lawn. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS467
01:09:17,00 --> 01:09:23,50
SOMEONE stares, only the top half of his face visible, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS468
01:09:20,00 --> 01:09:26,50
as SOMEONE<Brian> kicks off his running shoes and goes inside. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS469
01:09:23,00 --> 01:09:29,50
Staying put, SOMEONE<Matt> narrows his eyes. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS470
01:09:26,00 --> 01:09:32,50
SOMEONE<Brian> comes back out, guzzling water from a bottle. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS471
01:09:29,00 --> 01:09:34,50
He descends halfway down the porch steps, then leans back against a supporting pillar. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS473
01:09:34,00 --> 01:09:41,50
A pretty woman with strawberry blond hair comes out, trailed by two boys. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS474
01:09:42,00 --> 01:09:48,50
They bring plates and cups to a table on the lawn. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS475
01:09:46,00 --> 01:09:52,50
SOMEONE's<Matt's> arched eyebrows knit and his eyes narrow. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS477
01:09:52,00 --> 01:09:56,50
He slowly sinks out of view. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS478
01:09:54,00 --> 01:09:58,50
Now, sitting on a blanket on the beach, SOMEONE<Matt> leans back on his hands. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS479
01:09:56,00 --> 01:10:02,50
Beside him, SOMEONE<Alex> lies down and chats with a reclining Sid. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS481
01:10:01,00 --> 01:10:08,50
Several yards ahead, SOMEONE's<Scottie's> form bobs in and out of view as she plays in the ocean. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS482
01:10:05,00 --> 01:10:13,50
As SOMEONE<Matt> watches her, he shoots frequent glances over his shoulder toward SOMEONE's<Brian's> rental. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS483
01:10:15,00 --> 01:10:21,50
Behind him, the strawberry blond emerges with her young boys. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS484
01:10:22,00 --> 01:10:25,50
SOMEONE notices, as the boys race to the water. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS485
01:10:24,00 --> 01:10:33,50
The woman slows to a walk. Wearing a sun hat and a long-sleeved shirt of sky blue, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS487
01:10:33,00 --> 01:10:39,50
she drops a large, fashionable tote in the sand, walks to the water's edge, and cups her hands around her mouth. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS488
01:10:40,00 --> 01:10:45,50
The boys splash each other rambunctiously. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS489
01:10:43,00 --> 01:10:47,50
SOMEONE<Matt> leans toward SOMEONE<Alex>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS490
01:10:46,00 --> 01:10:51,50
SOMEONE<Alex> rolls over and sits up. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS491
01:10:48,00 --> 01:10:53,50
She glances toward SOMEONE<Scottie>, then gazes after her father curiously. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS494
01:10:53,00 --> 01:11:00,50
SOMEONE<Matt> meanders down to the water's edge and stops a few feet from the woman. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS495
01:10:58,00 --> 01:11:04,50
In her sweater and black bikini bottoms, she watches her boys at play. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS496
01:11:26,00 --> 01:11:31,50
The woman grins good-naturedly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS497
01:11:31,00 --> 01:11:37,50
SOMEONE<Matt> bites back a comment and faces the water. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS498
01:11:49,00 --> 01:11:54,50
The woman offers a sincere concerned frown. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS499
01:11:58,00 --> 01:12:02,50
SOMEONE<Matt> musters a smile. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS500
01:12:02,00 --> 01:12:06,50
The mother faces the water. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS501
01:12:05,00 --> 01:12:11,50
Watching her, SOMEONE<Matt> adopts a breezy demeanor. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS502
01:12:26,00 --> 01:12:32,50
SOMEONE<Matt> twitches himself out of a statue-like hold. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS503
01:12:37,00 --> 01:12:41,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> marches from the water. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS504
01:12:42,00 --> 01:12:50,50
As SOMEONE<Matt> joins SOMEONE<Scottie>, Mrs. SOMEONE's<Speer's> smile fades and she watches him with a furrowed brow. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS505
01:12:48,00 --> 01:12:54,50
Now, shafts of sunlight beam through gaps in the clouds, lighting up patches of the ocean. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS507
01:12:53,00 --> 01:12:59,50
In a forest, a rusted metal bridge spans a green brook. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS509
01:12:59,00 --> 01:13:04,50
Raindrops plop into the placid water, dotting it with tiny percolations. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS510
01:13:02,00 --> 01:13:11,50
Now, SOMEONE<Matt>, his daughters, and SOMEONE<Sid> walk toward an inviting ragtag bungalow with a porch and white-fenced yard. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS511
01:13:08,00 --> 01:13:15,50
A sign out front reads "Tahiti Nui Restaurant Cocktail Lounge". 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS512
01:13:12,00 --> 01:13:18,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> leads the way up to the porch, then through the doorway. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS513
01:13:16,00 --> 01:13:23,50
The family pauses near the threshold, taking in the thriving casual hot spot. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS514
01:13:20,00 --> 01:13:30,50
On a small stage, three male singers perform on stools as they strum a guitar, a ukulele, and a bass. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS515
01:13:28,00 --> 01:13:35,50
Scanning the restaurant, SOMEONE<Matt> spots a man with grey, shoulder-length hair at the bar. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS516
01:13:37,00 --> 01:13:46,50
SOMEONE<Matt> sidles down the narrow gap between the bar and a wall, then rounds a corner to the other side and joins SOMEONE<Hugh>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS517
01:14:58,00 --> 01:15:02,50
SOMEONE<Matt> stares confusedly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS518
01:16:01,00 --> 01:16:07,50
SOMEONE<Matt> lowers his thunderstruck gaze, then faces the stage. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS519
01:16:26,00 --> 01:16:34,50
SOMEONE<Matt> adopts a nonchalant air. SOMEONE's<Hugh's> easygoing smile fades. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS520
01:16:35,00 --> 01:16:43,50
SOMEONE<Matt> regards his cousin with a flinty stare. Looking away, he puts on a smile. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS521
01:16:44,00 --> 01:16:50,50
With a worried frown, SOMEONE<Hugh> bridles, and blinks at his cousin. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS522
01:16:47,00 --> 01:16:51,50
SOMEONE<Matt> gets up. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS523
01:16:56,00 --> 01:17:03,50
The cousins hug and SOMEONE<Hugh> sends SOMEONE<Matt> off with an affectionate rub of the head. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS524
01:17:00,00 --> 01:17:06,50
The shell shocked man lumbers across the dining area. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS525
01:17:04,00 --> 01:17:11,50
Reaching his table, he collapses into a chair and leans back heavily. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS526
01:17:08,00 --> 01:17:13,50
He stares off with glistening eyes. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS527
01:17:11,00 --> 01:17:16,50
SOMEONE<Matt> lifts his brow and blinks back his tears. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS529
01:17:15,00 --> 01:17:20,50
Taking a breath, he shakes himself out of his thoughts. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS530
01:17:18,00 --> 01:17:26,50
SOMEONE<Sid>, who is seated between his daughters, faces us as though we're in SOMEONE's<Matt's> position. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS531
01:17:28,00 --> 01:17:32,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> bobs to the music. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS532
01:17:31,00 --> 01:17:35,50
SOMEONE<Alex> looks at us. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS533
01:17:34,00 --> 01:17:43,50
SOMEONE's<Matt's> looking at us as he replies. His gaze wilts. He glances at the band, then rubs his face. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS534
01:17:41,00 --> 01:17:51,50
His weary profile shows against the backdrop of the lively performers. He idly surveys the bar, then peers over his shoulder, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS535
01:17:48,00 --> 01:17:54,50
giving us a view of his distracted face head on. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS536
01:17:51,00 --> 01:18:01,50
Now, under a dusky sky, SOMEONE<Matt>, his daughters, and SOMEONE<Sid> walk alongside a fence that borders a green field. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS537
01:17:58,00 --> 01:18:05,50
Mountains loom in the distance. SOMEONE<Scottie> and SOMEONE<Sid> walk a few paces ahead. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS538
01:18:23,00 --> 01:18:27,50
SOMEONE<Alex> bites her lip. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS539
01:18:38,00 --> 01:18:43,50
At night, SOMEONE<Sid> addresses SOMEONE<Matt>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS540
01:18:42,00 --> 01:18:46,50
He leaves with SOMEONE<Scottie>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS541
01:18:45,00 --> 01:18:50,50
SOMEONE<Matt> and SOMEONE<Alex> make their way across the narrow road. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS542
01:18:49,00 --> 01:18:56,50
Walking side by side, they advance on the large cottage occupied by the Speers. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS543
01:19:02,00 --> 01:19:09,50
Moving around the house, they find Mrs. Speer coming out onto the back porch. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS544
01:19:14,00 --> 01:19:18,50
SOMEONE's<Brian's> wife turns. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS545
01:19:29,00 --> 01:19:33,50
SOMEONE<Alex> mouths "Howdy". 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS546
01:20:11,00 --> 01:20:15,50
SOMEONE<Brian> comes out. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS547
01:20:20,00 --> 01:20:24,50
SOMEONE's<Brian's> grin falters. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS548
01:20:30,00 --> 01:20:34,50
SOMEONE<Julie> goes inside. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS549
01:20:32,00 --> 01:20:36,50
SOMEONE<Brian> conjures his toothy grin. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS550
01:20:35,00 --> 01:20:39,50
His smile vanishes. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS551
01:20:43,00 --> 01:20:49,50
SOMEONE<Brian> responds with a hangdog stare. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS552
01:20:53,00 --> 01:20:58,50
Behind SOMEONE<Brian>, indoors, SOMEONE<Julie> gets drinks. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS553
01:21:22,00 --> 01:21:26,50
SOMEONE<Julie> returns. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS554
01:21:40,00 --> 01:21:47,50
Holding his wife close, SOMEONE<Brian> forces a carefree grin. SOMEONE<Matt> smiles pleasantly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS555
01:22:20,00 --> 01:22:24,50
SOMEONE<Julie> takes SOMEONE's<Alex's> side. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS556
01:22:21,00 --> 01:22:29,50
As SOMEONE<Brian> stares after them, SOMEONE<Matt> steps into his line of sight with a firm glare. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS557
01:22:26,00 --> 01:22:33,50
The real estate agent obediently opens the screen door. The two men go in. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS558
01:22:32,00 --> 01:22:37,50
SOMEONE<Brian> faces SOMEONE<Matt> anxiously. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS559
01:22:46,00 --> 01:22:50,50
SOMEONE<Brian> leans on a counter. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS560
01:23:30,00 --> 01:23:34,50
SOMEONE's<Brian's> lips form a tearful pout. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS562
01:23:44,00 --> 01:23:48,50
SOMEONE<Brian> looks away and licks his lips. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS563
01:23:45,00 --> 01:23:49,50
Straightening, he faces SOMEONE<Matt>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS564
01:23:47,00 --> 01:23:53,50
SOMEONE<Brian> draws his dumbfounded mouth shut and nods. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS565
01:23:50,00 --> 01:23:54,50
SOMEONE's<Matt's> gaze grows melancholy. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS566
01:23:56,00 --> 01:24:00,50
SOMEONE<Brian> looks down shamefully. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS567
01:23:58,00 --> 01:24:03,50
SOMEONE<Matt> responds with a bitter sneer and shakes his head. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS568
01:24:46,00 --> 01:24:52,50
SOMEONE<Brian> lowers his remorseful gaze and his lips pucker. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS569
01:25:01,00 --> 01:25:05,50
SOMEONE<Matt> bristles. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS570
01:25:02,00 --> 01:25:08,50
His jaw tightens and he holds SOMEONE<Brian> in a weary, disdainful stare. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS572
01:25:16,00 --> 01:25:20,50
He exits the cottage. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS573
01:25:32,00 --> 01:25:40,50
As she leans in to hug him, SOMEONE<Matt> tilts his head and gives her a full kiss on the lips instead. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS574
01:25:37,00 --> 01:25:43,50
With an intense stare, he heads off, leaving SOMEONE<Julie> confused. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS575
01:25:41,00 --> 01:25:47,50
Now, on the flight back, SOMEONE<Matt> stares off pensively. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS576
01:25:50,00 --> 01:25:58,50
Sitting behind him, SOMEONE<Alex> scoots forward in her seat and claps a hand on his shoulder. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS577
01:26:35,00 --> 01:26:42,50
SOMEONE<Alex> nods faintly. Her father turns away and hangs his head. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS578
01:26:39,00 --> 01:26:45,50
In the window seat beside her big sister, SOMEONE sleeps with 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS579
01:26:42,00 --> 01:26:47,50
a pillow between her head and the wall. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS580
01:26:44,00 --> 01:26:52,50
As she stirs a little, getting comfortable, the image dissolves to a corridor in the hospital. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS581
01:26:49,00 --> 01:26:56,50
SOMEONE<Matt>, his daughters, and SOMEONE<Sid> trudge in from around a corner. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS584
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:03,50
As the girls approach SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> bed, SOMEONE<Alex> wraps her arm around her sister's shoulders. They gaze at their unresponsive mother. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS585
01:27:00,00 --> 01:27:08,50
She lies with each hand curled around a rolled up towel and her mouth hanging slack. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS586
01:27:06,00 --> 01:27:12,50
Now, a kind-faced woman addresses SOMEONE<Scottie>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS587
01:27:17,00 --> 01:27:24,50
SOMEONE<Alex>, Dr. SOMEONE<Jonhston>, and SOMEONE<Matt> look on from in front of SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> bed. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS588
01:27:26,00 --> 01:27:32,50
The grief counselor's lips form a sympathetic line. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS589
01:27:29,00 --> 01:27:36,50
SOMEONE's<Scottie's> eyes fill with tears and she turns to her father. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS590
01:27:33,00 --> 01:27:38,50
Seeing his woeful look, she lowers her gaze. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS591
01:27:36,00 --> 01:27:42,50
The kind-faced counselor strokes SOMEONE's<Scottie's> arm. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS592
01:27:44,00 --> 01:27:50,50
Her lips trembling, the girl turns back to face her. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS593
01:27:47,00 --> 01:27:53,50
As the counselor continues speaking, SOMEONE's<Scottie's> face crumples in anguish. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS594
01:27:51,00 --> 01:27:58,50
The bereaved little girl watches the woman leave with Dr. SOMEONE<A>,

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS596
01:27:57,00 --> 01:28:02,50
then embraces her father, burying her face in his chest. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS597
01:28:00,00 --> 01:28:04,50
He kisses the top of her head. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS598
01:28:02,00 --> 01:28:09,50
He caresses her hair, then tilts her face up to meet his gaze. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS599
01:28:06,00 --> 01:28:12,50
SOMEONE<Alex> gently slides her hands down her sister's ponytail. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS600
01:28:10,00 --> 01:28:14,50
Cradling SOMEONE's head, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS601
01:28:11,00 --> 01:28:16,50
SOMEONE<Matt> lifts his eyes to his older daughter. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS602
01:28:14,00 --> 01:28:20,50
SOMEONE<Alex> pushes out a breath and shifts her attention to her mother. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS603
01:28:18,00 --> 01:28:23,50
Later, our view shifts from SOMEONE's bed 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS604
01:28:20,00 --> 01:28:26,50
to SOMEONE<Matt> doing paperwork and SOMEONE<Alex> and SOMEONE<Sid> reading books. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS605
01:28:29,00 --> 01:28:36,50
From the corridor, SOMEONE<Scott> peers into the room, then enters with his wife and son behind him. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS606
01:28:37,00 --> 01:28:41,50
SOMEONE<Matt> sets aside his work. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS607
01:28:43,00 --> 01:28:48,50
He and SOMEONE<Alex> hug SOMEONE<Barry> and his frail mother. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS608
01:28:59,00 --> 01:29:07,50
As SOMEONE<Alex> leads her uncle and grandmother to SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> bedside, SOMEONE<Scott> shifts his gaze to SOMEONE<Sid>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS609
01:29:06,00 --> 01:29:12,50
The boy gives him a sullen look, then turns away. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS610
01:30:09,00 --> 01:30:15,50
SOMEONE<Matt> scowls at his father-in-law, then stares off bitterly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS611
01:30:13,00 --> 01:30:17,50
Closing his eyes, he lets his head droop. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS612
01:30:26,00 --> 01:30:34,50
A faint smile briefly plays on SOMEONE's<Matt's> face as he gives the teens a surprised look. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS613
01:30:31,00 --> 01:30:38,50
SOMEONE<Scott> shrugs his lips, then joins his family at SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> bedside. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS614
01:30:41,00 --> 01:30:48,50
SOMEONE<Matt> gestures to SOMEONE<Alex> and SOMEONE<Sid> and they follow him into the corridor. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS615
01:30:45,00 --> 01:30:49,50
He pulls the door closed. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS616
01:30:54,00 --> 01:31:00,50
Opening the door a crack, SOMEONE<Matt> peeks back into the room. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS617
01:30:57,00 --> 01:31:03,50
SOMEONE<Alex> and SOMEONE<Sid> move in close to him and they all spy on standing at his daughter's bedside. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS620
01:31:03,00 --> 01:31:08,50
The grief-stricken man gives a helpless shrug, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS621
01:31:05,00 --> 01:31:11,50
then leans over SOMEONE<Elizabeth> and strokes her hair. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS622
01:31:14,00 --> 01:31:19,50
The three outside watch sympathetically. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS623
01:31:20,00 --> 01:31:27,50
Resting his hand on his daughter's head, SOMEONE<Scott> bends down and gives her a light kiss on the cheek. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS624
01:31:24,00 --> 01:31:30,50
The onlookers watch him whisper "I love you". 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS625
01:31:27,00 --> 01:31:33,50
He continues caressing his daughter's hair. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS626
01:31:32,00 --> 01:31:37,50
Tightening his lips defeatedly, he withdraws his hand. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS627
01:31:36,00 --> 01:31:44,50
He lifts his gaze from his dying daughter and glances, unfocused, toward the doorway. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS628
01:31:42,00 --> 01:31:48,50
In the morning, sunlight peeks through a blanket of clouds 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS629
01:31:45,00 --> 01:31:50,50
and shines down on a lush mountain ridge. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS630
01:31:48,00 --> 01:31:54,50
At home, SOMEONE<Matt> sleeps with his face resting on his cluttered desk. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS631
01:31:51,00 --> 01:31:56,50
One of his fingers twitches and he awakes. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS632
01:31:55,00 --> 01:31:59,50
With a frown, he sits up. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS633
01:31:58,00 --> 01:32:06,50
Blinking groggily, he looks at his watch, then leans forward on his elbows and shifts his thoughtful eyes. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS634
01:32:04,00 --> 01:32:09,50
He pushes his chair back from the desk and rises. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS635
01:32:09,00 --> 01:32:15,50
He exits past the portraits of his great great grandparents. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS636
01:32:12,00 --> 01:32:18,50
The image dissolves to a sprawling wind-blown property. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS637
01:32:16,00 --> 01:32:21,50
SOMEONE’s<Matt’s> car glides toward a fork in a long driveway. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS638
01:32:19,00 --> 01:32:25,50
To one side lies a large ranch style house and a tennis court. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS639
01:32:23,00 --> 01:32:31,50
On the other, grazing ducks scatter as SOMEONE<Matt> pulls over onto a well-manicured lawn and parks. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS641
01:32:30,00 --> 01:32:35,50
Now, he enters the large house, allowing sunlight to filter through the screen door into the unlit living room. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS643
01:32:36,00 --> 01:32:42,50
As he pushes open the curtains on the front windows, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS644
01:32:39,00 --> 01:32:46,50
more daylight washes over a wall decorated with framed photos. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS645
01:32:44,00 --> 01:32:48,50
He strolls past it, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS648
01:32:50,00 --> 01:32:55,50
then stops and gazes at the black and white images of his ancestors.  

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS649
01:32:52,00 --> 01:32:57,50
A mustached man gives a serious look. Another shows a frizzy-haired woman. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS650
01:32:54,00 --> 01:33:01,50
In a third photo, four men in suits stand on a building's front steps. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS652
01:33:04,00 --> 01:33:09,50
Behind the glass of a large frame, wooden block letters spell out "Kikila". Above an antique photo of a man with a mutton chop beard, a plaque beside it reads "Cecil Kikila King. the namesake of this beautiful place. He was a prominent attorney, banker, and socialite in old Hawaii. ". 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS658
01:33:20,00 --> 01:33:26,50
SOMEONE<Matt> eyes more photos of family members throughout the years. two men and two women in 1920s era garb. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS664
01:33:35,00 --> 01:33:41,50
Leaving the photos, SOMEONE<Matt> steps out onto the lawn. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS665
01:33:38,00 --> 01:33:44,50
A group of about 40 suddenly fades into view - 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS666
01:33:41,00 --> 01:33:47,50
some at picnic tables, others standing around chatting. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS667
01:33:47,00 --> 01:33:56,50
One of the King cousins breaks off from the socializing to place a folded slip of paper in a large wooden bowl, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS668
01:33:53,00 --> 01:33:57,50
then sets down a pen. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS669
01:33:56,00 --> 01:34:00,50
SOMEONE<Ralph> laughs. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS670
01:33:57,00 --> 01:34:02,50
Wink smokes a cigar. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS671
01:33:59,00 --> 01:34:03,50
SOMEONE<Hugh> talks with SOMEONE<Matt>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS672
01:34:11,00 --> 01:34:16,50
Dogs laze about in the grass at their owner's feet. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS673
01:34:14,00 --> 01:34:20,50
Two more cousins drop off folded slips of paper into the wooden bowl. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS674
01:34:26,00 --> 01:34:33,50
Now, SOMEONE<Matt> stares off with doleful eyes as he sits at a table. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS675
01:34:30,00 --> 01:34:35,50
SOMEONE<Hugh> unfolds a ballot and reads it. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS676
01:34:47,00 --> 01:34:51,50
He hands SOMEONE<Matt> paperwork. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS677
01:34:56,00 --> 01:35:00,50
He offers a pen. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS678
01:34:57,00 --> 01:35:02,50
Frowning, SOMEONE<Matt> takes it, then flips through the paperwork. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS679
01:35:01,00 --> 01:35:06,50
SOMEONE<Milo> and SOMEONE<Hugh> watch with encouraging smiles. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS680
01:35:04,00 --> 01:35:10,50
SOMEONE<Matt> thoughtfully hovers his pen over the blank signature line. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS681
01:35:20,00 --> 01:35:24,50
He gazes at the documents. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS682
01:35:22,00 --> 01:35:27,50
SOMEONE<Hugh> furrows his bushy eyebrows. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS683
01:35:24,00 --> 01:35:31,50
SOMEONE<Matt> glances at his two cousins, then looks back at the contract and shakes his head. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS684
01:35:37,00 --> 01:35:42,50
SOMEONE<Hugh> and SOMEONE<Milo> give him shocked looks. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS685
01:36:21,00 --> 01:36:28,50
SOMEONE<Hugh> glances at SOMEONE<Milo>, then shakes his head with a frustrated smile. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS686
01:37:27,00 --> 01:37:33,50
Tossing the documents aside, he gives his cousins a resolute look. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS687
01:37:31,00 --> 01:37:37,50
SOMEONE<Milo> lifts his brow and shares a thoughtful glance with SOMEONE<Hugh>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS688
01:37:34,00 --> 01:37:40,50
The long-haired, heavyset cousin smirks disapprovingly at SOMEONE<Matt>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS689
01:37:41,00 --> 01:37:46,50
He rubs his nose then stands. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS690
01:37:46,00 --> 01:37:50,50
The crowd looks over. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS691
01:37:51,00 --> 01:37:55,50
He slaps SOMEONE's<Matt's> shoulder. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS692
01:37:54,00 --> 01:38:00,50
Rising from his chair, SOMEONE<Matt> faces the group and gives them a nod. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS693
01:38:02,00 --> 01:38:06,50
They all watch him expectantly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS694
01:38:04,00 --> 01:38:13,50
The scene in front of him fades to SOMEONE's hospital room, where our view edges closer to the back of his head 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS695
01:38:10,00 --> 01:38:14,50
as he watches his family. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS696
01:38:16,00 --> 01:38:22,50
Now, we travel up the bed quilt to SOMEONE's hands 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS697
01:38:19,00 --> 01:38:25,50
still curled loosely around the towel rolls. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS698
01:38:22,00 --> 01:38:27,50
Just above the neckline of her hospital gown, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS699
01:38:24,00 --> 01:38:30,50
a gauze dressing covers the stoma in her trachea, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS700
01:38:28,00 --> 01:38:33,50
its center dampened with a moist circle. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS701
01:38:30,00 --> 01:38:36,50
Her mouth hangs open, her lips dry and slightly parched, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS702
01:38:33,00 --> 01:38:38,50
while her head lies tilted to one side. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS703
01:38:36,00 --> 01:38:41,50
On a couch, SOMEONE<Scottie> lies asleep. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS704
01:38:38,00 --> 01:38:46,50
SOMEONE<Sid> sits lazily in a chair with one leg crooked upward as he somberly does homework. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS705
01:38:46,00 --> 01:38:52,50
Slouched in another seat, SOMEONE<Alex> stares at her dying mother. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS706
01:38:49,00 --> 01:38:56,50
Our view drifts closer to her plaintive face as she blinks tears from her eyes. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS708
01:39:00,00 --> 01:39:06,50
As the door opens, SOMEONE peers over her shoulder and sees a woman entering, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS709
01:39:03,00 --> 01:39:09,50
her face obscured by a large bouquet held in front of it. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS710
01:39:06,00 --> 01:39:11,50
SOMEONE<Matt> stares with surprised eyes. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS711
01:39:09,00 --> 01:39:15,50
Lowering the flowers, SOMEONE<Julie> Speer glances between him and SOMEONE<Alex>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS712
01:39:13,00 --> 01:39:17,50
The teen shoots her father a questioning look. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS714
01:39:15,00 --> 01:39:19,50
SOMEONE<Matt> stands. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS715
01:39:52,00 --> 01:39:56,50
SOMEONE<Julie> forces a pained smile. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS716
01:40:05,00 --> 01:40:10,50
She puts on her shoes. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS717
01:40:09,00 --> 01:40:17,50
SOMEONE<Julie> flashes a polite smile at SOMEONE<Alex>, who follows SOMEONE<Scottie> and SOMEONE<Sid> out. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS718
01:40:14,00 --> 01:40:20,50
SOMEONE<Matt> opens his mouth as if to speak, then shrugs his hands. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS719
01:40:18,00 --> 01:40:23,50
He and SOMEONE<Julie> turn toward SOMEONE<Elizabeth>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS720
01:40:35,00 --> 01:40:40,50
She gives him a pointed look 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS721
01:40:37,00 --> 01:40:41,50
and he nods sadly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS722
01:41:38,00 --> 01:41:43,50
SOMEONE<Matt> glances uncertainly at his wife. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS723
01:41:44,00 --> 01:41:50,50
Shifting her tearful eyes to SOMEONE<Elizabeth>, SOMEONE<Julie> steps to her side. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS724
01:41:47,00 --> 01:41:52,50
While SOMEONE watches from the foot of the bed, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS725
01:41:50,00 --> 01:41:57,50
SOMEONE's<Julie's> face contorts in anguish as she gazes at the comatose woman. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS726
01:42:01,00 --> 01:42:07,50
She stares down at SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> frozen, slack-jawed expression. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS727
01:42:14,00 --> 01:42:19,50
SOMEONE<Matt> nods empathetically. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS728
01:42:44,00 --> 01:42:51,50
SOMEONE<Matt> gently takes her arm, guides her to the door, then stops and meets her gaze. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS729
01:42:55,00 --> 01:43:01,50
With a nod, SOMEONE<Matt> opens the door for her. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS730
01:43:03,00 --> 01:43:07,50
SOMEONE<Matt> shuts it and sighs. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS731
01:43:06,00 --> 01:43:14,50
He turns his back to the door and stares across the room at SOMEONE<Elizabeth> in her bed. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS732
01:43:15,00 --> 01:43:21,50
Remaining fixed on her, SOMEONE draws and expels a deep breath, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS733
01:43:19,00 --> 01:43:25,50
then ambles across the room and stands at her bedside. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS734
01:43:25,00 --> 01:43:31,50
The middle-aged man's weary gaze grows affectionate as he reaches out to her. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS736
01:43:33,00 --> 01:43:39,50
Looking over her frail form, he breathes softly. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS737
01:43:40,00 --> 01:43:46,50
His fingers caress the pale woman's hair just above her forehead. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS738
01:43:46,00 --> 01:43:51,50
With a fond look in his eyes, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS739
01:43:48,00 --> 01:43:52,50
he smiles. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS740
01:43:55,00 --> 01:44:01,50
He bends down and leans over her, his fingers lingering on her brow. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS741
01:44:01,00 --> 01:44:07,50
He gives her a long, gentle kiss on the lips, then remains 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS743
01:44:05,00 --> 01:44:09,50
hovering just inches above her. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS744
01:44:25,00 --> 01:44:30,50
A tear rolls down his nose. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS747
01:44:37,00 --> 01:44:43,50
In a waiting area, SOMEONE sits beside her father with tears in her eyes. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS748
01:44:40,00 --> 01:44:47,50
Our view drifts to SOMEONE's<Matt's> weary face as he stares across the room. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS749
01:44:45,00 --> 01:44:50,50
The door to SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> room opens. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS750
01:44:47,00 --> 01:44:53,50
SOMEONE steps out, her eyes puffy and red. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS751
01:44:50,00 --> 01:44:55,50
SOMEONE<and> crosses the hallway toward her family. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS752
01:44:56,00 --> 01:45:01,50
SOMEONE<Matt> rises from his chair and faces her. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS754
01:45:02,00 --> 01:45:06,50
SOMEONE<Alex> hugs her father. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS756
01:45:07,00 --> 01:45:11,50
Resting her chin on his shoulder, she gazes upward. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS757
01:45:08,00 --> 01:45:15,50
He kisses her temple, then stands aside as she crosses to SOMEONE<Sid>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS758
01:45:13,00 --> 01:45:18,50
She gives her shaggy-haired friend a hug. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS759
01:45:15,00 --> 01:45:21,50
Peering over his shoulder with her arm wrapped around his neck. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS760
01:45:19,00 --> 01:45:24,50
SOMEONE<Alex> faces her younger sister. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS761
01:45:21,00 --> 01:45:27,50
Gazing up from her chair, SOMEONE<Scottie> purses her lips. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS762
01:45:25,00 --> 01:45:31,50
SOMEONE<Alex> offers her hands, then guides her sister up from her seat. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS763
01:45:29,00 --> 01:45:35,50
She wraps her arm around the girl and they head off together. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS764
01:45:33,00 --> 01:45:39,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch SOMEONE lead SOMEONE across the hallway 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS765
01:45:37,00 --> 01:45:41,50
SOMEONE lead SOMEONE into SOMEONE's room. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS766
01:45:43,00 --> 01:45:50,50
Now, a puffy cumulus cloud dominates the lower half of a sky view. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS767
01:45:48,00 --> 01:45:55,50
Its vapor edge forms fanciful bulges and dips across the blueness green vegetation blankets a mountain range. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS771
01:45:59,00 --> 01:46:04,50
On the yet unsold land, the overlook offers a majestic view of the cove and the meadows and wild groves inland of it. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS773
01:46:05,00 --> 01:46:12,50
Beyond a line of breaking waves, vibrant shades of ocean blue extend to the horizon meeting powder blue sky. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS776
01:46:15,00 --> 01:46:20,50
The blossoms of a plumeria flutter in a breeze, their petals in shades of yellow and pink. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS778
01:46:20,00 --> 01:46:25,50
Now, sitting aboard an outrigger canoe, SOMEONE<Alex> nods and accepts a container. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS779
01:46:23,00 --> 01:46:28,50
She wears a pink and white lei around her neck. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS781
01:46:28,00 --> 01:46:33,50
SOMEONE<Matt> watches his daughter from across the boat, wearing a lei of autumn colors. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS782
01:46:30,00 --> 01:46:36,50
They float about a mile from the urban coastline. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS783
01:46:33,00 --> 01:46:40,50
SOMEONE<Alex> draws a scoop of ashes from the container and looks at her father. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS784
01:46:39,00 --> 01:46:45,50
He shifts his serene gaze, then gives her a soft nod. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS785
01:46:42,00 --> 01:46:49,50
The peaceful young woman looks at the ashes and purses her lips. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS786
01:46:47,00 --> 01:46:51,50
Sitting in the middle of the boat, 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS787
01:46:48,00 --> 01:46:55,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> watches her sister pour the scoop of ashes into the water. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS788
01:46:53,00 --> 01:46:57,50
SOMEONE<Alex> hands the container to her. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS790
01:46:59,00 --> 01:47:04,50
They younger girl tearfully takes hold of the scoop handle, but lets go of it and passes the canister on to SOMEONE<Matt>. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS791
01:47:02,00 --> 01:47:08,50
The middle-aged widower gazes at the gray dust. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS792
01:47:05,00 --> 01:47:12,50
A skyward view from the ashes shows a breeze blowing through his grey hair. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS793
01:47:10,00 --> 01:47:16,50
The girls watch as he holds the container over the side of the boat 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS794
01:47:13,00 --> 01:47:19,50
and pours the rest of SOMEONE's<Elizabeth's> ashes into the sea. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS795
01:47:17,00 --> 01:47:24,50
He taps the container against the side of the canoe to empty it completely. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS797
01:47:26,00 --> 01:47:30,50
SOMEONE<Matt> watches the ashes mix with the water, then glances at his daughters. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS798
01:47:34,00 --> 01:47:40,50
He takes off his lei and sets it on the water. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS799
01:47:38,00 --> 01:47:42,50
SOMEONE<Alex> and SOMEONE<Scottie> do the same. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS800
01:47:40,00 --> 01:47:47,50
They watch their leis floating beside the boat, bobbing on the surface. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS802
01:47:47,00 --> 01:47:53,50
Seen from underwater, the leis show in silhouette against the gleaming sunlight. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS803
01:47:51,00 --> 01:47:57,50
They take on amoeba-like shapes as they float beside the canoe. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS809
01:48:05,00 --> 01:48:09,50
SOMEONE<Scottie> lies on the couch under a blanket. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS811
01:48:21,00 --> 01:48:28,50
Beyond the couch, SOMEONE steps out from an arched doorway with two bowls. In shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, SOMEONE<Matt> joins SOMEONE<Scottie> and hands her one of the bowls. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS812
01:48:35,00 --> 01:48:41,50
SOMEONE<Matt> sits on the couch and rests his feet on an ottoman. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS814
01:48:40,00 --> 01:48:46,50
As they eat their ice cream, SOMEONE<Alex> enters the distant dining room and digs through a bag on the table. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS815
01:48:44,00 --> 01:48:50,50
SOMEONE<Matt> adjusts the end of SOMEONE's<Scottie's> blanket and covers his legs. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS816
01:48:48,00 --> 01:48:55,50
SOMEONE<Alex> notices them from the dining room and strides observantly through an archway. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS817
01:48:53,00 --> 01:48:59,50
Arms folded, she halts behind the ice cream eating pair. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS819
01:49:00,00 --> 01:49:05,50
SOMEONE drops her arms to her sides, then steps around the couch and takes a seat 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS821
01:49:04,00 --> 01:49:10,50
beside her father, forcing him more into the middle as she takes a corner of the blanket. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS823
01:49:10,00 --> 01:49:15,50
As they remain focused on their movie, SOMEONE<Matt> helps SOMEONE<Alex> lay the blanket over her legs. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS824
01:49:20,00 --> 01:49:26,50
He hands her his bowl of ice cream and she rests it on her lap. 

THE_DESCENDANTS_DVS825
01:49:24,00 --> 01:49:29,50
As the trio watch the movie together,
