UGLY_TRUTH_DVS28
00:02:45,00 --> 00:02:50,50
She enters an office. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS29
00:03:08,00 --> 00:03:14,50
SOMEONE<Abby> calmly brings a whistle to her lips. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS30
00:03:13,00 --> 00:03:17,50
Now in a control room. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS31
00:03:18,00 --> 00:03:23,50
The team shoots a cooking segment. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS32
00:03:27,00 --> 00:03:33,50
SOMEONE<Abby> sips an energy drink as she oversees production. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS33
00:03:30,00 --> 00:03:36,50
On set, the female anchor tastes the sauce. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS34
00:03:44,00 --> 00:03:48,50
The anchorwoman's eyes widen. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS35
00:04:05,00 --> 00:04:09,50
A weatherman eats. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS36
00:04:23,00 --> 00:04:29,50
Spinning wearily in his chair, the director faces SOMEONE<Abby>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS37
00:04:44,00 --> 00:04:50,50
A monitor shows Rocco swigging from a wine bottle. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS38
00:04:49,00 --> 00:04:56,50
SOMEONE<Larry> gulps it down. In an office, a balding man switches off the feed. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS39
00:05:43,00 --> 00:05:48,50
Now she flosses in a ladies room. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS40
00:06:10,00 --> 00:06:14,50
SOMEONE<Joy> shows a photo. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS41
00:06:16,00 --> 00:06:21,50
She indicates her breasts. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS42
00:06:24,00 --> 00:06:29,50
Now SOMEONE<Abby> approaches a restaurant hostess. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS43
00:06:41,00 --> 00:06:46,50
Later SOMEONE<Abby> and her date share a table. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS44
00:07:10,00 --> 00:07:14,50
The waiter steps away. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS45
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:24,50
SOMEONE<Abby> takes the printout from her purse. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS46
00:08:06,00 --> 00:08:12,50
Later SOMEONE<Abby> walks alone through the courtyard leading to her apartment. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS47
00:08:10,00 --> 00:08:16,50
A view from her living room window shows her passing outside. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS48
00:08:14,00 --> 00:08:20,50
She enters and flips a switch, lighting the cheerily decorated apartment. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS49
00:08:18,00 --> 00:08:23,50
A gray tabby cat prances over to her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS50
00:08:22,00 --> 00:08:26,50
It rubs against her ankle. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS51
00:08:27,00 --> 00:08:32,50
Bending over, SOMEONE<Abby> pets the cat. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS52
00:08:29,00 --> 00:08:35,50
Her smile fades as she straightens. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS53
00:08:34,00 --> 00:08:38,50
Now a remote lies on a bed. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS54
00:08:38,00 --> 00:08:42,50
The cat steps on it. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS55
00:08:46,00 --> 00:08:52,50
SOMEONE enters from the bathroom 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS57
00:08:50,00 --> 00:08:55,50
He chucks it in the trash. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS59
00:08:54,00 --> 00:08:59,50
SOMEONE<Abby> eyes books on her nightstand. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS63
00:09:06,00 --> 00:09:11,50
He pours gasoline in the trash can. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS66
00:09:11,00 --> 00:09:16,50
He lights a match. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS67
00:09:14,00 --> 00:09:19,50
He tosses it in. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS89
00:10:01,00 --> 00:10:07,50
He grabs a skewered marshmallow and swallows it whole. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS90
00:10:05,00 --> 00:10:10,50
With a disgusted gape, SOMEONE<Abby> makes a phone call. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS136
00:12:03,00 --> 00:12:08,50
He hits an alarm. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS143
00:12:24,00 --> 00:12:28,50
He disconnects her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS146
00:12:30,00 --> 00:12:34,50
The next day. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS148
00:12:35,00 --> 00:12:42,50
They enter a conference room. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS151
00:12:44,00 --> 00:12:49,50
SOMEONE<Stuart> turns on a TV. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS152
00:12:48,00 --> 00:12:52,50
SOMEONE<Abby> gapes. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS153
00:12:51,00 --> 00:12:55,50
She turns it off. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS169
00:13:24,00 --> 00:13:29,50
SOMEONE<Stuart> reads. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS179
00:13:39,00 --> 00:13:45,50
SOMEONE<Mike> swaggers into the room and grins. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS181
00:13:44,00 --> 00:13:49,50
SOMEONE<Abby> gapes. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS184
00:13:53,00 --> 00:13:58,50
SOMEONE<Abby> haughtily lifts her chin. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS185
00:13:58,00 --> 00:14:03,50
SOMEONE<Mike> shakes her hand and smirks. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS186
00:14:08,00 --> 00:14:13,50
SOMEONE<Mike> steals a muffin. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS187
00:14:23,00 --> 00:14:28,50
Later SOMEONE<Abby> paces in her office. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS188
00:14:26,00 --> 00:14:31,50
SOMEONE<Mike> knocks on the door, then opens it. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS189
00:15:27,00 --> 00:15:33,50
SOMEONE<Abby> rolls her eyes and storms out. Later in the studio. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS190
00:15:48,00 --> 00:15:52,50
He eyes SOMEONE<Georgia>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS192
00:15:55,00 --> 00:16:01,50
Now SOMEONE<Mike> sits at the news desk. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS193
00:15:58,00 --> 00:16:04,50
SOMEONE<Georgia> and SOMEONE<Larry> sit to his left. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS200
00:16:15,00 --> 00:16:25,50
In the control room. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS206
00:16:37,00 --> 00:16:43,50
SOMEONE<Abby> sneers at SOMEONE<Stuart>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS213
00:17:23,00 --> 00:17:28,50
SOMEONE<Larry> looks sharply at SOMEONE<Mike>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS215
00:18:11,00 --> 00:18:15,50
SOMEONE<Mike> puts his arm around SOMEONE<Larry>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS216
00:19:04,00 --> 00:19:08,50
SOMEONE<Abby> faces SOMEONE<Stuart>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS217
00:19:11,00 --> 00:19:15,50
He shrugs. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS218
00:19:30,00 --> 00:19:35,50
SOMEONE<Mike> wheels SOMEONE's<Larry's> chair toward SOMEONE<Georgia>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS219
00:19:48,00 --> 00:19:53,50
SOMEONE<Larry> kisses SOMEONE<Georgia> passionately. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS220
00:19:57,00 --> 00:20:04,50
SOMEONE<Stuart> laughs as SOMEONE<Larry> heaves his wife over his shoulder and carries her away. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS222
00:20:14,00 --> 00:20:20,50
SOMEONE<Joy> discovers SOMEONE<Abby> curled up on the floor in a closet. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS223
00:20:27,00 --> 00:20:31,50
SOMEONE<Abby> sits up and frowns. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS224
00:20:44,00 --> 00:20:49,50
SOMEONE<Joy> reads. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS225
00:21:07,00 --> 00:21:12,50
With a thumbs-up, SOMEONE<Stuart> strides out. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS226
00:21:12,00 --> 00:21:16,50
SOMEONE<Joy> smiles uncertainly. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS227
00:21:14,00 --> 00:21:19,50
SOMEONE<Abby> closes the closet door, shutting herself in. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS228
00:21:17,00 --> 00:21:23,50
Now a girl rides her bicycle past a modest suburban home. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS229
00:21:21,00 --> 00:21:29,50
In a guest house, SOMEONE<Mike> tosses a bag to the floor, swigs from a can of Pepsi, and listens to an answering machine. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS230
00:21:33,00 --> 00:21:40,50
SOMEONE<Mike> closes his eyes and crosses himself, then takes off his jacket. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS231
00:21:43,00 --> 00:21:47,50
A boy enters. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS232
00:21:48,00 --> 00:21:52,50
SOMEONE<Mike> fumbles with the machine. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS234
00:21:54,00 --> 00:21:59,50
He yanks the machine from the wall. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS235
00:21:57,00 --> 00:22:01,50
SOMEONE<Mike> follows the boy outside. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS236
00:22:14,00 --> 00:22:18,50
They enter the main house. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS237
00:22:26,00 --> 00:22:30,50
A woman enters. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS238
00:22:40,00 --> 00:22:44,50
She sits between them. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS239
00:22:50,00 --> 00:22:56,50
She flips open the lid of a pastry box and kisses his cheek. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS240
00:22:53,00 --> 00:22:58,50
Now in her bathroom, SOMEONE<Abby> faces a mirror. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS241
00:22:56,00 --> 00:23:03,50
She takes out a hair clip and fluffs her shoulder-length hair with both hands. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS243
00:23:04,00 --> 00:23:09,50
Her cat sits by a broken fish bowl. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS244
00:23:08,00 --> 00:23:13,50
She chases him down the stair 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS245
00:23:14,00 --> 00:23:21,50
SOMEONE<D'Artagnan> jumps out the living room window. He scales a tree and perches on a high branch. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS246
00:23:23,00 --> 00:23:28,50
SOMEONE<Abby> stands below, hands on her hips. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS247
00:23:28,00 --> 00:23:33,50
She climbs the tree in a hoodie and slip. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS248
00:23:36,00 --> 00:23:41,50
She stretches out her hands. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS249
00:23:40,00 --> 00:23:45,50
The cat moves farther away. SOMEONE<Abby> catches him. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS250
00:23:45,00 --> 00:23:50,50
She holds him close and looks down. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS251
00:23:49,00 --> 00:23:53,50
She shifts on a branch. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS252
00:23:53,00 --> 00:24:00,50
She spots a well-built man through a pair of open balcony doors as he exits a shower. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS253
00:23:59,00 --> 00:24:06,50
She claps a hand over her cat's mouth, then continues to ogle her neighbor. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS254
00:24:08,00 --> 00:24:14,50
She clutches a branch for balance as he steps outside, flossing. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS255
00:24:13,00 --> 00:24:21,50
She beams. The branch under her feet snaps and she hangs upside-down. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS256
00:24:18,00 --> 00:24:25,50
The bottom hem of her slip dangles around her neck, revealing her panties. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS257
00:24:27,00 --> 00:24:33,50
The well-built neighbor runs out, clutching a towel around his waist. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS258
00:24:34,00 --> 00:24:40,50
SOMEONE<Abby> accidentally rips off his towel. She covers her eyes. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS260
00:24:46,00 --> 00:24:50,50
He bandages her ankle. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS261
00:25:03,00 --> 00:25:08,50
Now clothed, her neighbor smiles. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS262
00:25:15,00 --> 00:25:20,50
SOMEONE<D'Artagnan> rubs up against the doctor's leg. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS263
00:25:23,00 --> 00:25:27,50
He picks up SOMEONE<D'Artagnan>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS264
00:25:26,00 --> 00:25:31,50
SOMEONE's<Abby's> jaw drops into a gleeful grin. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS265
00:25:29,00 --> 00:25:35,50
Her neighbor strokes SOMEONE<D'Artagnan> and gives a friendly smile. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS266
00:25:36,00 --> 00:25:43,50
She lustfully eyes him up and down. He arches a brow and points to the door. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS267
00:25:42,00 --> 00:25:47,50
She heads over and opens it with a toothy grin. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS268
00:25:48,00 --> 00:25:53,50
She leaves without SOMEONE<D'Artagnan>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS269
00:25:50,00 --> 00:25:56,50
The doctor opens his door and finds her dancing on his porch. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS270
00:26:03,00 --> 00:26:07,50
He hands her SOMEONE<D'Artagnan>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS271
00:26:04,00 --> 00:26:09,50
Daytime, at the studio. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS272
00:26:24,00 --> 00:26:30,50
SOMEONE<Abby> spots SOMEONE<Mike> flirting with the makeup artist and holds up a finger. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS273
00:26:29,00 --> 00:26:38,50
She marches over to him as the artist brushes makeup on his face. The woman's flirty smile fades. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS274
00:26:36,00 --> 00:26:41,50
SOMEONE<Abby> glares at her as she leaves. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS275
00:26:40,00 --> 00:26:45,50
She leans closer to SOMEONE<Mike>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS276
00:27:08,00 --> 00:27:13,50
SOMEONE<Abby> shoves an earpiece into the cocky host's ear. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS277
00:27:11,00 --> 00:27:16,50
She rips off his makeup bib. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS278
00:27:22,00 --> 00:27:27,50
Now SOMEONE<Abby> watches from the control room. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS279
00:27:38,00 --> 00:27:42,50
He walks to a set. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS280
00:27:53,00 --> 00:27:57,50
He leaves the set. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS281
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:05,50
He strolls outside the studio. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS282
00:28:07,00 --> 00:28:13,50
Two women in bikinis grapple in red liquid. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS283
00:28:14,00 --> 00:28:19,50
SOMEONE<Joy> holds four phones. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS284
00:28:33,00 --> 00:28:39,50
The two women seize SOMEONE<Mike>, yank him into the pool, and tear open his shirt. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS285
00:28:37,00 --> 00:28:41,50
In the control room. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS286
00:28:45,00 --> 00:28:49,50
SOMEONE<Abby> talks into a mic. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS287
00:28:49,00 --> 00:28:53,50
SOMEONE<Mike> touches his earpiece. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS288
00:28:54,00 --> 00:29:01,50
She watches on the monitors as SOMEONE<Mike> grabs one of the women's hands and sucks on her finger. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS289
00:28:58,00 --> 00:29:05,50
The woman tosses her head ecstatically. He faces the camera. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS290
00:29:10,00 --> 00:29:15,50
At the news desk, SOMEONE<Georgia> gapes. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS291
00:29:22,00 --> 00:29:31,50
Later, SOMEONE<Abby> sits in a chair and summons a calming breath. SOMEONE<Mike> swaggers in with his arms around the bikini-clad women. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS292
00:29:30,00 --> 00:29:35,50
As he halts in front of SOMEONE<Abby>, the women head off. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS293
00:29:38,00 --> 00:29:43,50
He gives SOMEONE<Abby> a proud grin and raises his brow. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS294
00:30:04,00 --> 00:30:09,50
SOMEONE<Abby> storms off. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS295
00:30:11,00 --> 00:30:15,50
In a dream, SOMEONE<Abby> stands naked with cartoon clouds covering her chest and hips. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS297
00:30:27,00 --> 00:30:34,50
A cartoony cowboy with SOMEONE's<Mike's> face rides a thrusting hot dog behind her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS298
00:30:31,00 --> 00:30:37,50
A cartoon sun peaks out of her cloud mini skirt. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS299
00:30:35,00 --> 00:30:39,50
Now she sits up in bed. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS300
00:30:45,00 --> 00:30:49,50
She flops back down. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS301
00:30:46,00 --> 00:30:51,50
Daytime, in the studio break area. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS302
00:31:01,00 --> 00:31:08,50
The coworker hands each of them a page and SOMEONE<Abby> shoots SOMEONE<Joy> a look. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS303
00:31:12,00 --> 00:31:17,50
SOMEONE<Mike> joins SOMEONE<Abby> at the coffee maker. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS304
00:31:24,00 --> 00:31:28,50
He eyes her curiously. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS305
00:31:52,00 --> 00:31:56,50
SOMEONE<Joy> looks on. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS306
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:07,50
As SOMEONE<Abby> heads off, SOMEONE<Mike> follows. They enter the producer's office. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS307
00:32:16,00 --> 00:32:24,50
SOMEONE<Abby> glares. She grabs SOMEONE's<Colin's> business card, puts the phone to her ear and dials. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS308
00:32:24,00 --> 00:32:30,50
She ignores SOMEONE<Mike>. He snatches the card from her hand. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS309
00:32:42,00 --> 00:32:47,50
SOMEONE<Mike> grabs a cordless and listens in. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS310
00:32:48,00 --> 00:32:53,50
SOMEONE<Mike> holds up a shushing finger. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS311
00:32:56,00 --> 00:33:00,50
SOMEONE<Colin> signs a report. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS312
00:32:59,00 --> 00:33:04,50
He stands, using a nurse station phone. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS313
00:33:03,00 --> 00:33:09,50
SOMEONE<Mike> tries to get SOMEONE's<Abby's> attention, but she waves him off. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS314
00:33:13,00 --> 00:33:17,50
SOMEONE<Mike> bats her hand away. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS315
00:33:24,00 --> 00:33:30,50
SOMEONE<Mike> disconnects the call. SOMEONE<Colin> eyes his phone. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS316
00:33:31,00 --> 00:33:36,50
She reaches for the phone. SOMEONE<Mike> sits on it. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS317
00:33:56,00 --> 00:34:01,50
SOMEONE<Mike> returns to his chair. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS318
00:34:06,00 --> 00:34:11,50
SOMEONE<Mike> blocks her reach. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS319
00:34:33,00 --> 00:34:38,50
SOMEONE<Mike> and SOMEONE<Abby> lower their phones. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS320
00:34:41,00 --> 00:34:45,50
SOMEONE<Colin> shrugs and grins. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS321
00:34:47,00 --> 00:34:51,50
SOMEONE<Mike> puts SOMEONE<Colin> on hold. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS322
00:35:33,00 --> 00:35:38,50
He glances off, then eyes her frankly. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS323
00:35:39,00 --> 00:35:43,50
SOMEONE<Mike> nods and glances at the phone. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS324
00:35:41,00 --> 00:35:47,50
The digital display counts past 37 seconds. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS325
00:35:47,00 --> 00:35:53,50
At the doctor's office, SOMEONE<Colin> waits. SOMEONE<Abby> glares across her desk at SOMEONE<Mike>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS326
00:35:55,00 --> 00:35:59,50
SOMEONE<Mike> hangs up. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS327
00:35:59,00 --> 00:36:03,50
SOMEONE<Mike> gets up. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS328
00:36:03,00 --> 00:36:07,50
She joins him. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS329
00:36:08,00 --> 00:36:12,50
Now at a coffee shop. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS330
00:36:44,00 --> 00:36:48,50
She sips from her coffee mug. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS331
00:36:48,00 --> 00:36:53,50
Now they browse dresses in a SOMEONE<tony> boutique. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS332
00:37:08,00 --> 00:37:14,50
At his snap, a red-haired saleswoman smiles. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS333
00:37:33,00 --> 00:37:38,50
He eyes a black SOMEONE<lacy> bra. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS334
00:37:42,00 --> 00:37:47,50
Later they hold a cocktail dress up to SOMEONE<Abby>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS336
00:38:05,00 --> 00:38:09,50
He slaps her butt. Outside. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS337
00:38:58,00 --> 00:39:02,50
Nighttime at SOMEONE's<Abby's> apartment. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS338
00:39:00,00 --> 00:39:05,50
SOMEONE<Mike> sits on a chair, where he finds SOMEONE's<Abby's> knitting. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS339
00:39:02,00 --> 00:39:08,50
He drops it aside with a smirk, then glances up toward the 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS340
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:17,50
stairs. SOMEONE<Abby> descends in black stiletto heels and a flattering black cocktail dress that pushes up her cleavage. Her blonde hair is longer and styled with wavy feathering. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS341
00:39:35,00 --> 00:39:39,50
He stands. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS342
00:39:57,00 --> 00:40:01,50
She slaps his butt. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS343
00:40:14,00 --> 00:40:19,50
She leans in coyly and caresses his chest. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS344
00:40:32,00 --> 00:40:37,50
Her lips hover inches from his. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS345
00:40:55,00 --> 00:40:59,50
SOMEONE<Mike> hops behind the couch. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS346
00:40:57,00 --> 00:41:01,50
He slaps her butt again. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS347
00:41:00,00 --> 00:41:05,50
As she answers the door, he ducks down. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS348
00:41:05,00 --> 00:41:09,50
SOMEONE<Colin> checks her out. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS349
00:41:20,00 --> 00:41:25,50
He notices SOMEONE<Mike> peeking over the couch. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS350
00:41:27,00 --> 00:41:31,50
She shuts the door. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS351
00:41:38,00 --> 00:41:44,50
SOMEONE<Abby> points and beams at SOMEONE<Mike>, who gives her a thumbs-up. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS352
00:41:41,00 --> 00:41:51,50
He watches as she breaks into a goofy giddy dance. Now at the baseball game, a pitcher winds up and throws the ball. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS353
00:41:48,00 --> 00:41:53,50
A batter swings and hits, and the crowd rises. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS354
00:41:53,00 --> 00:41:59,50
SOMEONE<Abby>, who eats popcorn, enters with SOMEONE<Colin>. He carries drinks. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS355
00:41:59,00 --> 00:42:04,50
She nods. SOMEONE<Mike> sits a few rows up. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS356
00:42:04,00 --> 00:42:08,50
SOMEONE<Mike> sits. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS357
00:42:09,00 --> 00:42:13,50
SOMEONE<Mike> sits. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS358
00:42:13,00 --> 00:42:20,50
With a mouthful of popcorn and a semi-nod, SOMEONE<Abby> gives a sneering grin. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS359
00:42:32,00 --> 00:42:39,50
He grins. Now a runner rounds second base and an outfielder goes for the ball. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS360
00:42:36,00 --> 00:42:42,50
In the stands, SOMEONE<Mike> rises with the rest of the crowd. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS361
00:42:39,00 --> 00:42:43,50
SOMEONE<Colin> turns to a vendor. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS362
00:42:42,00 --> 00:42:47,50
Nearby, a woman recognizes SOMEONE<Mike>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS363
00:42:48,00 --> 00:42:53,50
She hugs him. Her date intervenes. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS364
00:42:58,00 --> 00:43:03,50
Sitting back in his seat, SOMEONE<Mike> covers his mouth. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS365
00:43:09,00 --> 00:43:14,50
A fat female vendor. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS366
00:43:16,00 --> 00:43:20,50
SOMEONE<Colin> accepts two dogs. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS367
00:43:27,00 --> 00:43:32,50
She nods and raises the hot dog. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS368
00:43:33,00 --> 00:43:38,50
She spills her soda on SOMEONE's<Colin's> lap. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS369
00:43:37,00 --> 00:43:42,50
She fastidiously wipes at his pants. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS370
00:43:49,00 --> 00:43:58,50
SOMEONE<Colin> winces a little as she works his loins. Spectators stare and the camera man approaches. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS371
00:43:55,00 --> 00:44:08,50
Over the score board, a big screen's kiss cam shows SOMEONE<Colin> reclining for SOMEONE's<Abby's> bowed head and jerking arm motions. SOMEONE<Mike> stands. Ball players on the field notice. SOMEONE<Abby> keeps wiping. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS372
00:44:09,00 --> 00:44:14,50
Onscreen, SOMEONE<Abby> glances up, then at the camera. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS373
00:44:15,00 --> 00:44:22,50
At night, SOMEONE<Abby> and SOMEONE<Colin> walk the courtyard between their apartments. SOMEONE<Mike> hides behind a bush. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS374
00:44:46,00 --> 00:44:50,50
He notices her chest. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS375
00:44:48,00 --> 00:44:55,50
As SOMEONE<Mike> watches from the bush, SOMEONE<Abby> turns away, but SOMEONE<Colin> grabs her arm and kisses her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS376
00:44:53,00 --> 00:44:57,50
SOMEONE's<Mike's> jaw drops. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS377
00:44:55,00 --> 00:45:00,50
They end their kiss and SOMEONE<Colin> smiles. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS378
00:45:10,00 --> 00:45:16,50
As they each head back to their own doors, they share another glance. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS379
00:45:18,00 --> 00:45:24,50
As SOMEONE<Colin> heads inside, SOMEONE<Abby> hurries over to SOMEONE<Mike>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS380
00:45:21,00 --> 00:45:26,50
He steps out with a grin and she gives him a big hug. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS381
00:45:43,00 --> 00:45:48,50
She still beams. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS382
00:45:51,00 --> 00:45:55,50
She prances off. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS383
00:45:52,00 --> 00:45:58,50
SOMEONE<Mike> takes his earpiece out and doffs his ball cap. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS384
00:45:55,00 --> 00:46:01,50
Walking off, he glances back toward SOMEONE's<Abby's> door. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS385
00:45:59,00 --> 00:46:06,50
Now at the studio, a camera's viewfinder shows SOMEONE<Mike> in a gorilla suit. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS386
00:46:15,00 --> 00:46:21,50
Video footage of humping monkeys plays behind SOMEONE<Georgia> and SOMEONE<Larry>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS387
00:46:18,00 --> 00:46:25,50
As SOMEONE<Abby> crosses off items on a list, SOMEONE<Joy> spies SOMEONE's<Mike's> nephew. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS388
00:46:24,00 --> 00:46:29,50
SOMEONE<Abby> hustles after the boy. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS389
00:46:47,00 --> 00:46:51,50
The anchors take notes. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS390
00:46:53,00 --> 00:46:58,50
As SOMEONE<Mike> spots his nephew, SOMEONE<Abby> looks on. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS391
00:47:14,00 --> 00:47:18,50
SOMEONE<Abby> grins. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS392
00:47:18,00 --> 00:47:22,50
He rubs the boy's head. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS393
00:47:26,00 --> 00:47:31,50
As the boy leaves, SOMEONE<Mike> passes SOMEONE<Abby>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS394
00:47:37,00 --> 00:47:41,50
SOMEONE<Mike> turns the back of his neck to her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS395
00:47:39,00 --> 00:47:44,50
SOMEONE<Abby> undoes his gorilla suit. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS396
00:47:45,00 --> 00:47:50,50
She does her goofy bouncy dance. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS397
00:47:48,00 --> 00:47:52,50
They sit. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS398
00:48:00,00 --> 00:48:06,50
An assistant pulls off the rest of his costume. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS399
00:48:26,00 --> 00:48:31,50
They cross the set to a coffee station. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS400
00:48:40,00 --> 00:48:44,50
SOMEONE<Joy> joins them. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS401
00:48:49,00 --> 00:48:54,50
SOMEONE<Joy> shoots SOMEONE<Abby> a look. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS402
00:49:17,00 --> 00:49:21,50
She walks with him. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS403
00:49:25,00 --> 00:49:32,50
Now SOMEONE<Abby> finds a blank gift bag, stuffed with purple tissue paper, on her welcome mat. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS404
00:49:30,00 --> 00:49:34,50
She picks up the gift and peeks around. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS405
00:49:32,00 --> 00:49:37,50
Finding the card, she steps back inside. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS407
00:49:43,00 --> 00:49:47,50
SOMEONE<Abby> opens the card. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS408
00:49:48,00 --> 00:49:54,50
It reads: This present isn't for you. It's for your bean. SOMEONE<Mike>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS409
00:49:55,00 --> 00:50:00,50
SOMEONE<Abby> finds a purple box in the gift bag. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS410
00:49:59,00 --> 00:50:05,50
She opens an information flap on the box. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS411
00:50:05,00 --> 00:50:15,50
Later SOMEONE<Abby> puts on lipstick at a mirror. She wears a white v-neck dress. A loose bun of her blonde curls rests at the back of her neck. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS412
00:50:14,00 --> 00:50:23,50
The producer caps her lipstick and picks up her cell phone. A text message reads: SOMEONE<Colin> Anderson running late. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS413
00:50:24,00 --> 00:50:31,50
Irritably pursing her lips, she picks up a glass of white wine and takes a seat. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS414
00:50:29,00 --> 00:50:37,50
SOMEONE<Abby> sips from her glass and idly smoothes her hair, then notices the gift on the coffee table. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS415
00:50:34,00 --> 00:50:39,50
She thoughtfully rumples her mouth, 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS416
00:50:36,00 --> 00:50:41,50
shrugs, and sets down her wine. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS417
00:50:39,00 --> 00:50:46,50
Reaching up underneath her flowing ramp dress, she slips off her white panties. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS418
00:50:43,00 --> 00:50:53,50
D'Artagnan comes downstairs. SOMEONE<Abby> picks up the SOMEONE<lacy>, black, vibrating panties and carefully works them over her black high heels. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS419
00:50:51,00 --> 00:50:58,50
Reaching underneath her dress once again, she shimmies them up to her waist. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS420
00:50:55,00 --> 00:51:02,50
The producer adjusts her skirt, then picks up a remote control. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS421
00:50:59,00 --> 00:51:04,50
D'Artagnan peeks at her curiously. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS422
00:51:13,00 --> 00:51:20,50
SOMEONE<Abby> hides her white panties in the gift box, then rushes to the front door with her purse. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS423
00:51:17,00 --> 00:51:24,50
Stowing the remote inside, she opens up and finds SOMEONE<Mike> and SOMEONE<Stuart>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS424
00:51:35,00 --> 00:51:41,50
SOMEONE<Abby> grins sardonically. SOMEONE<Mike> smirks back. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS425
00:51:44,00 --> 00:51:48,50
Later they ride in a car with SOMEONE<Colin>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS426
00:52:14,00 --> 00:52:19,50
Now in an upscale eatery, the jello girls join them. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS427
00:52:25,00 --> 00:52:30,50
SOMEONE<Mike> swaggers off, arms around both. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS428
00:52:27,00 --> 00:52:32,50
They all meet the corporate execs at the bar. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS429
00:52:41,00 --> 00:52:46,50
SOMEONE<Bob> pats SOMEONE<Mike> on the back. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS430
00:52:50,00 --> 00:52:55,50
Later at their table, a waiter pours wine. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS431
00:52:55,00 --> 00:53:00,50
SOMEONE<Abby> smiles at SOMEONE<Colin> and squeezes his arm. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS432
00:52:57,00 --> 00:53:02,50
SOMEONE<Mike> drums the table. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS433
00:53:03,00 --> 00:53:09,50
SOMEONE<Abby> kicks him under the table, upsetting her purse. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS434
00:53:07,00 --> 00:53:11,50
The remote rolls out. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS435
00:53:11,00 --> 00:53:19,50
A stocky pre-teen boy pick it up, quizzically rumpling his lips, and returns to his table. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS436
00:53:26,00 --> 00:53:31,50
The boy fiddles with the controls. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS437
00:53:29,00 --> 00:53:34,50
He shakes the remote, then hits a button. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS438
00:53:31,00 --> 00:53:35,50
A gauge goes up. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS439
00:53:34,00 --> 00:53:39,50
SOMEONE<Abby> leans under the table. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS440
00:53:38,00 --> 00:53:44,50
As SOMEONE<Mike> joins her, SOMEONE<Colin> checks his cell phone. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS441
00:53:42,00 --> 00:53:45,50
Under the table. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS442
00:53:48,00 --> 00:53:54,50
SOMEONE<Abby> cringes. Nearby, the boy shakes the remote. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS443
00:53:57,00 --> 00:54:02,50
SOMEONE<Abby> nods, then sits up. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS444
00:54:01,00 --> 00:54:08,50
SOMEONE<Mike> gives a wide grin. Under the table, SOMEONE<Abby> crosses her legs. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS445
00:54:24,00 --> 00:54:29,50
The boy fusses with the remote. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS446
00:54:29,00 --> 00:54:35,50
SOMEONE<Abby> musters a broad grin and calmly retakes her seat. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS447
00:54:38,00 --> 00:54:43,50
SOMEONE<Mike> spots the boy. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS448
00:54:43,00 --> 00:54:48,50
SOMEONE<Abby> struggles to sit still. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS449
00:54:59,00 --> 00:55:04,50
She glares at him, cringing. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS450
00:55:03,00 --> 00:55:07,50
SOMEONE<Mike> winks at her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS451
00:55:06,00 --> 00:55:12,50
SOMEONE<Abby> fidgets with her silverware and writhes. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS452
00:55:17,00 --> 00:55:21,50
SOMEONE<Stuart> gawks at her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS453
00:55:23,00 --> 00:55:29,50
The remote gauge reads: Ecstasy Level. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS455
00:55:34,00 --> 00:55:39,50
SOMEONE<Stuart> smiles and mops his brow. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS456
00:55:38,00 --> 00:55:45,50
SOMEONE<Colin> grins and SOMEONE<Mike> shrugs his brows. SOMEONE<Abby> lolls. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS457
00:55:48,00 --> 00:55:53,50
SOMEONE<Mike> takes the remote from the boy. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS458
00:55:53,00 --> 00:55:58,50
SOMEONE<Abby> spots him and seizes it. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS460
00:56:10,00 --> 00:56:16,50
SOMEONE<Abby> rolls her eyes, then looks back at their table. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS461
00:56:28,00 --> 00:56:37,50
SOMEONE<Colin> shakes SOMEONE's<Mike's> hand, then follows SOMEONE<Abby> out. As SOMEONE<Mike> gazes after them, SOMEONE<Stuart> approaches. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS462
00:56:41,00 --> 00:56:47,50
Daytime. SOMEONE<Abby> rides in SOMEONE's<Colin's> convertible. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS463
00:56:48,00 --> 00:56:57,50
Smiling and chatting, they speed down a narrow sun-dappled road in the woods. SOMEONE's<Abby's> long hair whips in the wind. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS464
00:56:55,00 --> 00:57:02,50
Later they round a curve on a mountainside, then drive across a towering bridge. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS465
00:57:09,00 --> 00:57:20,50
An aerial view shows the road winding over rolling wooded hills. Later in a sunny forest, SOMEONE<Colin> and SOMEONE<Abby> sit on boulders at the edge of a creek. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS466
00:57:18,00 --> 00:57:23,50
They tap wine glasses and drink. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS467
00:57:20,00 --> 00:57:26,50
As SOMEONE<Abby> beams at their surroundings, SOMEONE<Colin> raises a cracker. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS468
00:57:27,00 --> 00:57:35,50
SOMEONE<Abby> reaches for it, but SOMEONE<Colin> retracts it and feeds it to her himself. He turns away and SOMEONE<Abby> spits it out. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS469
00:57:32,00 --> 00:57:38,50
She winces disgustedly and wipes her mouth. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS470
00:57:35,00 --> 00:57:41,50
SOMEONE<Colin> faces her with a smile and she grins. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS471
00:57:39,00 --> 00:57:51,50
Later they hike barefoot across stones in the creek. SOMEONE<Colin> helps SOMEONE<Abby> onto a boulder and they share a tender kiss. Sunlight gleams on SOMEONE's<Abby's> golden hair. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS472
00:57:51,00 --> 00:57:58,50
Now in a coffee shop, SOMEONE<Colin> hands SOMEONE<Abby> and SOMEONE<Joy> two drinks. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS473
00:57:55,00 --> 00:58:07,50
As he turns away to pay the barista, SOMEONE<Abby> faces SOMEONE<Joy> and bounces girlishly. SOMEONE<Joy> mimes grabbing SOMEONE's<Colin's> waist, repeatedly thrusts her hips, then holds her heart. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS474
00:58:12,00 --> 00:58:18,50
Now on a kitchen set at the studio, SOMEONE<Mike> cooks with a shapely model. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS475
00:58:17,00 --> 00:58:23,50
On the studio floor, the delivery guy brings SOMEONE<Abby> a massive bouquet. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS476
00:58:24,00 --> 00:58:28,50
SOMEONE<Abby> and SOMEONE<Joy> read the card. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS477
00:58:27,00 --> 00:58:34,50
SOMEONE<Mike> notices them jumping up and down as he feeds the model a spoonful of chocolate. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS478
00:58:31,00 --> 00:58:37,50
He obliviously smears it all over the woman's face. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS479
00:58:34,00 --> 00:58:39,50
She irritably shakes her head. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS480
00:58:36,00 --> 00:58:41,50
Distracted by SOMEONE, SOMEONE absent- 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS481
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:48,50
mindedly wipes the model off. Now in the SF Saloon and Grill, SOMEONE<Abby> uses her cell. SOMEONE<Mike> sits across from her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS483
00:59:15,00 --> 00:59:20,50
He munches a snack, then leans forward. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS484
00:59:50,00 --> 00:59:58,50
SOMEONE<Mike> ogles a busty woman standing at the bar behind SOMEONE<Abby>. The producer follows his gaze and sneers. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS485
01:01:04,00 --> 01:01:08,50
SOMEONE<Abby> smiles to herself. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS486
01:01:17,00 --> 01:01:22,50
SOMEONE<Abby> shyly sips her white wine. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS487
01:01:19,00 --> 01:01:23,50
SOMEONE<Mike> leans back. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS488
01:01:32,00 --> 01:01:37,50
The producer smiles and raises her glass. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS489
01:01:39,00 --> 01:01:46,50
She drinks. SOMEONE<Mike> frowns thoughtfully. Now she watches him on a control room monitor. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS490
01:02:24,00 --> 01:02:28,50
Later in the studio. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS491
01:02:29,00 --> 01:02:36,50
On the set, SOMEONE<Larry> and SOMEONE<Georgia> canoodle. A techie ushers a short boyish guy to SOMEONE<Mike>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS492
01:02:50,00 --> 01:02:54,50
They hug. SOMEONE<Abby> approaches them. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS493
01:02:53,00 --> 01:02:56,50
They notice her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS494
01:03:21,00 --> 01:03:27,50
In the background, SOMEONE<Larry> and SOMEONE<Georgia> duck under the news desk. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS495
01:03:26,00 --> 01:03:33,50
Later in his office, SOMEONE<Stuart> sees SOMEONE<Abby> wave as she passes his window. He beckons her in. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS496
01:04:00,00 --> 01:04:07,50
SOMEONE<Abby> shakes her head, slack-jawed. Now an aerial view shows the LA skyline. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS497
01:04:05,00 --> 01:04:14,50
Outside the Century Plaza Hotel, a sprawling fountain spouts water in dozens of jets. A taxi arrives. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS499
01:04:14,00 --> 01:04:20,50
As a valet opens the door, SOMEONE<Abby> pays the driver. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS500
01:04:18,00 --> 01:04:22,50
She gets out. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS501
01:04:30,00 --> 01:04:35,50
Later SOMEONE<Mike> spots her in the lobby. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS502
01:04:49,00 --> 01:04:53,50
SOMEONE<Mike> strolls after her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS503
01:04:54,00 --> 01:04:58,50
Later in a limo. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS504
01:06:03,00 --> 01:06:07,50
SOMEONE<Abby> stammers. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS505
01:06:18,00 --> 01:06:23,50
SOMEONE<Abby> fumes. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS506
01:06:21,00 --> 01:06:26,50
At The Late Late Show. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS507
01:06:36,00 --> 01:06:41,50
SOMEONE<Abby> grabs SOMEONE<Mike> by the shoulders. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS508
01:06:49,00 --> 01:06:55,50
SOMEONE<Abby> smiles and claps as he goes on stage. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS509
01:06:53,00 --> 01:06:57,50
They share a manly hug. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS510
01:06:55,00 --> 01:06:59,50
SOMEONE<Mike> waves at the crowd. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS511
01:06:57,00 --> 01:07:01,50
He sits in chair. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS512
01:07:37,00 --> 01:07:42,50
With a smile, SOMEONE<Abby> walks to a monitor to watch the show. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS513
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:58,50
SOMEONE<Abby> looks toward the stage. She shifts her eyes back to the monitor and watches as SOMEONE<Mike> forces a smile. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS514
01:08:00,00 --> 01:08:07,50
Later SOMEONE<Mike> strolls into a restaurant and approaches the hostess. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS515
01:08:09,00 --> 01:08:13,50
The hostess leads him away. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS516
01:08:11,00 --> 01:08:17,50
A disco ball hangs from the high-arched ceiling, twinkling with light. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS517
01:08:14,00 --> 01:08:20,50
Directly below, patrons twirl on a large dance floor. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS518
01:08:19,00 --> 01:08:24,50
SOMEONE<Abby> sits in a booth, talking on the phone. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS519
01:08:25,00 --> 01:08:29,50
SOMEONE<Mike> arrives. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS520
01:08:27,00 --> 01:08:32,50
He sits across from her with a big grin. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS521
01:08:35,00 --> 01:08:39,50
He sips SOMEONE's<Abby's> drink. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS522
01:10:17,00 --> 01:10:22,50
A waitress stops at their table. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS523
01:10:31,00 --> 01:10:36,50
SOMEONE<Abby> gazes at SOMEONE<Mike>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS524
01:10:38,00 --> 01:10:43,50
A smile spreads across her face. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS525
01:10:42,00 --> 01:10:48,50
SOMEONE<Mike> gazes out at the dance floor, then turns to SOMEONE<Abby>. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS526
01:10:58,00 --> 01:11:03,50
He leads her to the dance floor and flings off his jacket. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS527
01:11:04,00 --> 01:11:15,50
SOMEONE<Mike> takes her hand and spins her away, then twirls underneath their joined hands, and pulls her into a tight embrace. He grins at her surprised smile. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS528
01:11:13,00 --> 01:11:17,50
SOMEONE<Mike> spins SOMEONE<Abby> again. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS529
01:11:15,00 --> 01:11:22,50
Holding both of her hands, he pushes her away, then pulls her in with her back against him. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS530
01:11:25,00 --> 01:11:30,50
Leaning against his chest, SOMEONE<Abby> slinks up and down. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS531
01:11:27,00 --> 01:11:33,50
SOMEONE<Mike> moves with her, his face buried in her hair. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS532
01:11:30,00 --> 01:11:41,50
He twirls her away, then brings her in, wrapping one arm around her waist. With their faces a few inches apart, they spin in tight circles. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS533
01:11:43,00 --> 01:11:54,50
SOMEONE<Abby> dances backward and SOMEONE<Mike> draws her back in by both hands. He dips her. She straightens with a wide grin and touches her forehead to his as they dance in a circle. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS534
01:11:52,00 --> 01:11:56,50
He raises her arms above her head. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS535
01:11:54,00 --> 01:12:01,50
She shimmies sexily as he runs his hands down her body. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS536
01:12:00,00 --> 01:12:06,50
She twirls away, then moves back into his arms. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS537
01:12:10,00 --> 01:12:17,50
SOMEONE<Mike> spins her away, then pivots gracefully underneath their arms. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS538
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:22,50
Sending her into a twirl, he lets go of one hand and catches her by the other. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS539
01:12:20,00 --> 01:12:26,50
She leaps back to him, wrapping her arms around his neck. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS540
01:12:27,00 --> 01:12:34,50
SOMEONE<Abby> gives SOMEONE<Mike> a sultry look as they embrace. Their faces draw close together. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS541
01:12:32,00 --> 01:12:37,50
SOMEONE<Abby> blinks and shrinks back slightly. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS542
01:12:39,00 --> 01:12:46,50
SOMEONE<Mike> meets her gaze for a moment, then turns away and gives a disappointed nod. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS543
01:12:46,00 --> 01:13:01,50
As SOMEONE<Mike> follows her off the dance floor, SOMEONE<Abby> brushes a strand of hair away from her face. Her smile fades. Now SOMEONE's<Abby's> black pumps dangle from her fingers as she and SOMEONE<Mike> walk to the elevators. He presses the call button, 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS544
01:12:59,00 --> 01:13:06,50
then leans against the wall with his hands in his pockets. SOMEONE<Abby> shifts nervously. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS545
01:13:05,00 --> 01:13:10,50
She hurries into the elevator. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS546
01:13:07,00 --> 01:13:12,50
SOMEONE<Mike> strolls in behind her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS547
01:13:09,00 --> 01:13:15,50
She gives him a sidelong glance as she slides her shoes back on. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS548
01:13:13,00 --> 01:13:18,50
SOMEONE<Mike> presses two buttons on the control panel. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS549
01:13:31,00 --> 01:13:39,50
They share a look. SOMEONE<Abby> shifts her eyes to the floor. SOMEONE<Mike> tilts his head toward the ceiling. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS550
01:13:38,00 --> 01:13:43,50
The elevator doors slide open and he grins awkwardly. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS551
01:13:47,00 --> 01:13:51,50
They hug tightly. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS552
01:13:50,00 --> 01:13:55,50
The doors start to slide shut. SOMEONE<Mike> stops them. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS553
01:13:55,00 --> 01:14:00,50
They hug again and kiss each other on the cheek. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS554
01:13:59,00 --> 01:14:04,50
The doors start to close again and SOMEONE<Mike> pushes them open. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS555
01:14:02,00 --> 01:14:12,50
He and SOMEONE<Abby> grab each other in a passionate embrace and kiss hungrily. She leans against the door frame as they heatedly make out. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS556
01:14:12,00 --> 01:14:18,50
SOMEONE<Mike> glances into the hallway. SOMEONE<Abby> steps back into the elevator. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS557
01:14:21,00 --> 01:14:26,50
He waves at her through the closing doors. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS558
01:14:25,00 --> 01:14:32,50
As SOMEONE<Mike> turns his back to the elevator, his jaw drops and his wide eyes shift disbelievingly. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS559
01:14:30,00 --> 01:14:34,50
He heads down the hall. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS560
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:40,50
Now SOMEONE<Abby> opens the door to her room. She sets down her belongings and sits heavily on a love seat. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS561
01:14:37,00 --> 01:14:41,50
Her brow furrowed thoughtfully, 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS562
01:14:38,00 --> 01:14:46,50
she gazes around the room, then removes her shoes and casually tosses them aside. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS563
01:14:57,00 --> 01:15:01,50
SOMEONE<Abby> stands hastily. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS564
01:14:58,00 --> 01:15:04,50
She smoothes out her dress, fluffs her hair, and hurries to the door. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS565
01:15:02,00 --> 01:15:09,50
She opens it to find SOMEONE<Colin> standing outside. Her face falls. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS566
01:15:10,00 --> 01:15:14,50
He steps inside and kisses her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS567
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:27,50
He sits. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS568
01:15:26,00 --> 01:15:31,50
SOMEONE<Abby> sits beside him on the love seat. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS569
01:15:33,00 --> 01:15:37,50
She looks away. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS570
01:15:47,00 --> 01:15:53,50
Champagne springs from the bottle in SOMEONE's<Colin's> hand. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS571
01:15:57,00 --> 01:16:06,50
As SOMEONE<Abby> rushes away, SOMEONE<Colin> stands and removes his shirt, exposing his well-toned chest. He grins. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS572
01:16:03,00 --> 01:16:08,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Mike> walks down a hallway. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS573
01:16:05,00 --> 01:16:11,50
He stops, turns the other way, then turns back again. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS574
01:16:18,00 --> 01:16:23,50
He rubs his nose nervously. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS575
01:16:26,00 --> 01:16:32,50
He strides determinedly to SOMEONE's<Abby's> door and raises his fist. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS576
01:16:31,00 --> 01:16:36,50
SOMEONE<Colin> answers, shirtless. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS577
01:16:39,00 --> 01:16:43,50
They shake hands. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS578
01:16:49,00 --> 01:16:53,50
SOMEONE<Abby> appears. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS579
01:17:11,00 --> 01:17:16,50
SOMEONE<Abby> watches regretfully as he shuffles away. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS580
01:17:14,00 --> 01:17:18,50
She closes the door. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS581
01:17:15,00 --> 01:17:22,50
As SOMEONE<Mike> heads down the hall, the door reopens, and SOMEONE<Abby> hurries after him. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS582
01:17:42,00 --> 01:17:47,50
His smile fades as he meets her gaze. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS583
01:17:44,00 --> 01:17:51,50
SOMEONE<Abby> sucks in a breath and steps closer, her eyes fixed on his face. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS584
01:17:49,00 --> 01:17:53,50
She gives him a pleading look. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS585
01:17:55,00 --> 01:18:00,50
SOMEONE<Mike> forces a casual smile. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS586
01:18:05,00 --> 01:18:10,50
SOMEONE<Abby> nods disappointedly and tilts her head. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS587
01:18:23,00 --> 01:18:28,50
She gives a bitter smile. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS588
01:18:25,00 --> 01:18:30,50
As it fades, she lifts her eyes to his. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS589
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:33,50
SOMEONE<Mike> turns his back to her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS590
01:18:30,00 --> 01:18:38,50
SOMEONE<Abby> watches sadly as he strolls down the hallway with his hands in his pockets. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS591
01:18:35,00 --> 01:18:40,50
She takes a breath and heads back to her room. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS592
01:18:38,00 --> 01:18:45,50
The yellow hallway lights glow harshly above SOMEONE<Mike> as he hangs his head for a moment. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS593
01:18:46,00 --> 01:18:50,50
SOMEONE<Abby> enters her room. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS594
01:18:48,00 --> 01:18:57,50
She glances around the spacious suite and finds SOMEONE<Colin> sitting at the edge of the bed, wearing a clean unbuttoned dress shirt. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS595
01:19:01,00 --> 01:19:06,50
He hands her a glass of champagne. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS596
01:19:12,00 --> 01:19:17,50
SOMEONE<Abby> chugs hers. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS597
01:19:18,00 --> 01:19:24,50
She cringes as she finishes the entire glass. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS598
01:19:25,00 --> 01:19:29,50
He raises his brow. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS599
01:19:48,00 --> 01:19:53,50
SOMEONE<Abby> pours herself another glass. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS600
01:19:53,00 --> 01:19:58,50
She turns away with the bottle. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS601
01:20:25,00 --> 01:20:31,50
She sips her champagne and leans against the back of a chair. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS602
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:33,50
SOMEONE<Colin> shifts uncomfortably. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS603
01:20:32,00 --> 01:20:38,50
He glances down at his exposed chest and pulls his shirt closed. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS604
01:20:36,00 --> 01:20:42,50
SOMEONE<Abby> sets her glass on the table and steps closer to him. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS605
01:20:41,00 --> 01:20:45,50
She shakes her head. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS606
01:21:03,00 --> 01:21:08,50
SOMEONE<Colin> stares at her confusedly. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS607
01:21:05,00 --> 01:21:10,50
SOMEONE<Abby> frowns and reaches to her head. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS608
01:21:09,00 --> 01:21:14,50
She released two hidden clips at the back of her hair, 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS609
01:21:12,00 --> 01:21:16,50
then two more on the sides. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS610
01:21:14,00 --> 01:21:19,50
SOMEONE<Colin> knits his brow as he watches. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS611
01:21:17,00 --> 01:21:24,50
SOMEONE<Abby> removes a hair extension to reveal her shorter natural length. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS612
01:21:23,00 --> 01:21:29,50
She self-consciously brushes her bangs out of her eyes. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS613
01:21:29,00 --> 01:21:33,50
Now at the office. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS614
01:21:32,00 --> 01:21:37,50
SOMEONE<Abby> finds SOMEONE<Stuart> waiting for her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS615
01:22:02,00 --> 01:22:06,50
Co-workers stare. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS616
01:22:15,00 --> 01:22:19,50
SOMEONE<Abby> points at each. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS617
01:22:22,00 --> 01:22:27,50
At the CBS affiliate. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS618
01:22:38,00 --> 01:22:43,50
SOMEONE<Mike> shakes SOMEONE's<Joe's> hand, then pats his shoulder. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS619
01:22:47,00 --> 01:22:53,50
A glittery shaft of sunlight on a river overtakes the image. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS620
01:23:00,00 --> 01:23:13,50
A dozen colorful hot air balloons hover in the sky at different altitudes. An assistant feeds a cable out from a news van, as a cameraman paces toward SOMEONE<Abby>, who stands by a grounded balloon. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS621
01:23:10,00 --> 01:23:17,50
A blandly handsome man inside the basket fires up the burner, startling her. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS622
01:23:19,00 --> 01:23:23,50
SOMEONE<Joy> shakes her head. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS623
01:23:33,00 --> 01:23:38,50
He points his finger like a gun and blows on the tip. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS624
01:23:49,00 --> 01:23:53,50
At the station. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS626
01:24:09,00 --> 01:24:14,50
SOMEONE<Joe> glances inside his news van. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS627
01:24:51,00 --> 01:24:56,50
SOMEONE<Abby> yanks him out of the balloon. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS628
01:25:07,00 --> 01:25:12,50
She takes SOMEONE's<Jack's> place in the basket. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS629
01:25:45,00 --> 01:25:50,50
SOMEONE<Mike> rises from his makeup chair. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS631
01:26:31,00 --> 01:26:35,50
He takes the mic. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS632
01:27:16,00 --> 01:27:21,50
She mimes jerking off. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS633
01:27:49,00 --> 01:27:55,50
The pilot fires up the burner. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS634
01:27:53,00 --> 01:27:57,50
The balloon rises. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS635
01:28:03,00 --> 01:28:10,50
He climbs over the edge. He sees the cameraman far below. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS636
01:28:13,00 --> 01:28:18,50
The control room monitor shows SOMEONE<Mike> and SOMEONE<Abby> in the basket. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS637
01:28:19,00 --> 01:28:25,50
SOMEONE<Abby> smacks his shoulder. They both fold their arms and pout. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS638
01:28:32,00 --> 01:28:36,50
SOMEONE<Stuart> pick up a phone. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS639
01:28:34,00 --> 01:28:41,50
In the basket, SOMEONE<Mike> gazes out at the dozens of balloons hovering over a tranquil harbor. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS640
01:28:38,00 --> 01:28:44,50
SOMEONE<Abby> peeks down at the verdant ground far below. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS641
01:28:42,00 --> 01:28:47,50
The balloon pilot produces a bottle and glasses. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS642
01:28:47,00 --> 01:28:52,50
SOMEONE<Abby> and SOMEONE<Mike> sulk. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS643
01:29:35,00 --> 01:29:40,50
SOMEONE<Stuart> loosens his collar. In the balloon. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS644
01:29:44,00 --> 01:29:48,50
SOMEONE's<Mike's> family watches. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS645
01:29:47,00 --> 01:29:51,50
SOMEONE<Joy> beams. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS646
01:30:08,00 --> 01:30:13,50
SOMEONE<Abby> lowers her petulant gaze. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS647
01:30:10,00 --> 01:30:16,50
SOMEONE<Mike> looks away, shakes his head, and takes a few deep breaths. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS648
01:30:15,00 --> 01:30:21,50
SOMEONE<Abby> stares at him out of the corners of her narrowed eyes, then faces him. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS649
01:30:23,00 --> 01:30:28,50
SOMEONE<Mike> soberly meets her gaze. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS650
01:30:30,00 --> 01:30:35,50
SOMEONE<Abby> stares into his eyes. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS651
01:30:32,00 --> 01:30:37,50
He looks away, shaking his head. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS652
01:30:34,00 --> 01:30:45,50
Flinging herself at him, SOMEONE<Abby> seizes his face and plants a passionate kiss on his lips. SOMEONE<Mike> wraps his arms around her 	and they sway in their embrace. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS653
01:30:44,00 --> 01:30:51,50
As SOMEONE<Mike> leans her against the basket's edge, the pilot looks on anxiously. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS654
01:30:48,00 --> 01:30:54,50
Keeping his lips locked on SOMEONE's,<Abby's,> SOMEONE<Mike> dismisses him with a wave. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS655
01:30:52,00 --> 01:30:58,50
The pilot turns away and the balloon floats off. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS657
01:31:08,00 --> 01:31:16,50
Light filters into SOMEONE's<Abby's> darkened bedroom through the drawn curtains, offering a shadowy view of the couple in bed. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS658
01:31:13,00 --> 01:31:19,50
SOMEONE<Mike> rolls off of her and flips on a lamp. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS659
01:31:16,00 --> 01:31:21,50
Sitting up, SOMEONE<Abby> grins. 

UGLY_TRUTH_DVS660
01:31:27,00 --> 01:31:33,50
SOMEONE<Abby> pounces on him and switches off the lamp.
