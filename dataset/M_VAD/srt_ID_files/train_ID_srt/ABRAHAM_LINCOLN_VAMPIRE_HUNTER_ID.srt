ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS27
00:02:41,00 --> 00:02:49,50
SOMEONE<Thomas> the enforcer down and punches him in the face sending him crashing into the water. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS28
00:02:47,00 --> 00:02:56,50
As SOMEONE's<Abraham's> mother and father help the boys to their feet, a pipe smoking man steps out. He wears a top hat and sunglasses. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS29
00:03:21,00 --> 00:03:28,50
As SOMEONE<Thomas> approaches, the pipe smoking man stops him with the butt of his cane. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS30
00:03:35,00 --> 00:03:42,50
He grabs the cane revealing its handle as a secret pistol aimed at his chest. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS31
00:03:42,00 --> 00:03:46,50
SOMEONE<Thomas> returns to his family. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS32
00:03:47,00 --> 00:03:52,50
Grinning, SOMEONE<Barts> pokes his tongue between his teeth. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS34
00:03:51,00 --> 00:03:56,50
Smoke plumes from the chimney of a log cabin. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS35
00:03:54,00 --> 00:03:59,50
Inside, writing in his journal. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS36
00:03:56,00 --> 00:04:03,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> peeks down from a loft glimpsing his parents asleep in bed. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS37
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:05,50
His candle blows out. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS38
00:04:02,00 --> 00:04:08,50
Watching the front door open, he inches back. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS39
00:04:05,00 --> 00:04:09,50
As the door opens wider. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS40
00:04:07,00 --> 00:04:12,50
SOMEONE's<Barts's> shadow spreads across the wall. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS41
00:04:10,00 --> 00:04:14,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> ducks down. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS42
00:04:11,00 --> 00:04:17,50
As SOMEONE<Barts> heads inside, the shadow leaves the wall. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS43
00:04:17,00 --> 00:04:23,50
Lying on the floor, SOMEONE<Abraham> reaches for the edge of a rug. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS44
00:04:24,00 --> 00:04:32,50
He pulls back the rug and peeks through a hole in the floorboards for a partial view of the floor below. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS45
00:04:30,00 --> 00:04:35,50
He watches SOMEONE<Barts> kneel at his mother's bedside. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS46
00:04:33,00 --> 00:04:40,50
Her open hand hangs off the edge of the bed, her wrist exposed to the intruder. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS47
00:04:38,00 --> 00:04:43,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> looks at his mother's sleeping face. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS48
00:04:41,00 --> 00:04:48,50
On returning his attention to her bedside, he finds SOMEONE<Barts> gaze on him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS52
00:04:59,00 --> 00:05:06,50
Her eyes roll back. The veins of her forearm show through her pale skin. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS53
00:05:13,00 --> 00:05:20,50
The priest heads off and SOMEONE<Thomas> follows leaving his wife alone in bed. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS54
00:05:20,00 --> 00:05:25,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> climbs down from the loft. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS55
00:05:27,00 --> 00:05:33,50
He lies down beside his mother, his leather bound journal in hand. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS56
00:05:33,00 --> 00:05:37,50
She smiles at him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS57
00:05:39,00 --> 00:05:45,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> shows her one of the pages. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS58
00:06:03,00 --> 00:06:08,50
His mother stops reading along. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS59
00:06:05,00 --> 00:06:10,50
She gazes absently. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS60
00:06:08,00 --> 00:06:14,50
The boy's gaze remains fixed on the open journal. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS61
00:06:18,00 --> 00:06:24,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> looks at his unresponsive mother. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS62
00:06:21,00 --> 00:06:28,50
Now in a snow dusted cemetery, the boy and his father stand at her grave. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS63
00:06:48,00 --> 00:06:56,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> lowers his gaze. Now, in a tavern, a tall young man writes in his journal. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS67
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:27,50
SOMEONE<Henry> slaps the drunk’s back. A pistol falls out of SOMEONE's<Abraham's> jacket and onto the floor. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS68
00:07:25,00 --> 00:07:31,50
He glances at the stranger then picks up his weapon and stumbles off. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS69
00:07:29,00 --> 00:07:34,50
Gazing thoughtfully, SOMEONE<Henry> sips his drink. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS70
00:07:31,00 --> 00:07:37,50
Now on the dock, SOMEONE<Barts> hurries after a couple. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS71
00:07:42,00 --> 00:07:48,50
In a boat, SOMEONE<Abraham> hides underneath the dock. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS72
00:08:10,00 --> 00:08:16,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> spies on the couple as they head off. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS73
00:08:13,00 --> 00:08:25,50
SOMEONE<Barts> leans against a pole watching his superior set on a rowboat with two others. A sign above a warehouse store reads J. SOMEONE<Barts> Shipping. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS74
00:08:27,00 --> 00:08:34,50
As SOMEONE<Barts> heads inside, SOMEONE<Abraham> climbs up a ladder to the dock. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS75
00:08:33,00 --> 00:08:39,50
He reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out his pistol. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS76
00:08:37,00 --> 00:08:44,50
As SOMEONE<Barts> walks unsuspectingly, SOMEONE<Abraham> takes aim at his back. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS78
00:08:48,00 --> 00:08:54,50
A puff of smoke rises from the misfired gun. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS79
00:08:58,00 --> 00:09:02,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> flees. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS80
00:09:01,00 --> 00:09:06,50
SOMEONE<Barts> marches after him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS81
00:09:10,00 --> 00:09:15,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> hides in a shed but can't lock the door. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS82
00:09:19,00 --> 00:09:26,50
He tears open a packet of gunpowder and dumps it down his gun's barrel. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS83
00:09:24,00 --> 00:09:28,50
He readies the hammer. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS84
00:09:29,00 --> 00:09:34,50
As he loads a bullet, a shove of the door jostles him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS85
00:09:35,00 --> 00:09:41,50
The bullet rolls near the body of a young woman. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS86
00:09:47,00 --> 00:09:59,50
SOMEONE<Barts> kicks open the door and SOMEONE<Abraham> fires the retrieved bullet at pointblank range. The murderer falls to his back his top hat landing several feet across the dock. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS87
00:09:57,00 --> 00:10:02,50
Catching his breath, SOMEONE<Abraham> lowers his pistol. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS88
00:09:59,00 --> 00:10:06,50
He looks at SOMEONE<Barts>, the bullet now lodged in the dead man's right eye. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS89
00:10:04,00 --> 00:10:10,50
Leaving, he steps over the body and ambles around a corner of the dock. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS90
00:10:09,00 --> 00:10:15,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> glances back at SOMEONE<Barts> who remains flat on his back. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS91
00:10:14,00 --> 00:10:19,50
He marches on across the dock through a dense fog. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS92
00:10:19,00 --> 00:10:25,50
Turning to the river, he chucks his pistol into the water. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS93
00:10:27,00 --> 00:10:33,50
He lingers for a moment then continues on. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS94
00:10:30,00 --> 00:10:37,50
Glancing back down the dock, he notices SOMEONE<Barts> body now missing. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS95
00:10:34,00 --> 00:10:39,50
As he turns, SOMEONE<Barts> faces him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS96
00:10:37,00 --> 00:10:51,50
As the vampire bares his sharp fangs, SOMEONE<Abraham> falls to his back. SOMEONE<Barts> lifts the young man overhead then slams his face through the dock. He rips open SOMEONE's<Abraham's> shirt, scratching his chest. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS97
00:10:49,00 --> 00:10:53,50
SOMEONE<Henry> stands over them. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS98
00:10:50,00 --> 00:10:55,50
He grabs SOMEONE<Barts> by the hair and flips him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS99
00:10:53,00 --> 00:11:08,50
The vampire crashes through the dock then gets thrown up along the warehouse shattering the wall. As he ascends towards a huge full moon above, the vampire disappears. Amid the falling shards of wood, SOMEONE<Henry> reaches towards SOMEONE<Abraham>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS100
00:11:07,00 --> 00:11:12,50
Now in bed, SOMEONE<Abraham> jolts awake. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS101
00:11:09,00 --> 00:11:14,50
Daylight shines in through a window. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS102
00:11:11,00 --> 00:11:17,50
The weary young man feels his wounded brow. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS103
00:11:14,00 --> 00:11:20,50
Water drips into various pots surrounding the bed. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS104
00:11:20,00 --> 00:11:27,50
Sitting up, he notices a bandage on his forearm and another on his bicep. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS105
00:11:24,00 --> 00:11:31,50
As he gazes at a wall, portraits of a man and woman come into focus. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS106
00:11:28,00 --> 00:11:35,50
Getting out of bed, SOMEONE<Abraham> steps in one of the pots of water. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS107
00:11:35,00 --> 00:11:42,50
The young man rises from the bed and braces himself on a mantle. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS108
00:11:39,00 --> 00:11:46,50
Weakly clutching his bruised side, he crosses to a desk where he finds his journal. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS109
00:11:44,00 --> 00:11:49,50
He opens it then turns his attention to a window. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS110
00:11:50,00 --> 00:11:57,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> steps out into a hall and peers towards a doorway. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS111
00:11:54,00 --> 00:12:02,50
He heads up a staircase, stopping after only a few steps to peek at an upper floor. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS112
00:12:02,00 --> 00:12:09,50
Hearing the sounds, SOMEONE<Abraham> hurries back down the steps and presses his ear to a door. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS113
00:12:10,00 --> 00:12:18,50
He grabs a three-foot candlestick, gathers himself then barges into the next room. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS114
00:12:17,00 --> 00:12:23,50
He finds a naked woman straddling SOMEONE<Henry> in a bathtub. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS115
00:12:32,00 --> 00:12:38,50
The naked woman steps out wrapped in a white sheet. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS116
00:12:35,00 --> 00:12:41,50
She looks SOMEONE<Abraham> over then continues on down some stairs. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS117
00:12:39,00 --> 00:12:44,50
SOMEONE<Henry> shoves SOMEONE<Abraham> out of his way. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS118
00:12:47,00 --> 00:12:52,50
SOMEONE<Henry> leads him down a staircase. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS119
00:12:52,00 --> 00:12:56,50
He gets dressed. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS120
00:13:08,00 --> 00:13:14,50
SOMEONE<Henry> pours himself a drink from a crystal decanter and downs it. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS121
00:13:35,00 --> 00:13:42,50
SOMEONE<Henry> swipes items from his desk, finds sunscreen and puts it on. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS122
00:13:56,00 --> 00:14:00,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> hands him a boot. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS123
00:14:06,00 --> 00:14:10,50
SOMEONE<Henry> sucks on a hookah. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS124
00:14:20,00 --> 00:14:27,50
Crossing to a front door, SOMEONE<Henry> puts on sunglasses. SOMEONE<Abraham> blocks the door. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS125
00:14:27,00 --> 00:14:32,50
SOMEONE<Henry> takes off his shades. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS126
00:15:11,00 --> 00:15:15,50
Now SOMEONE<Henry> selects a gun. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS127
00:15:16,00 --> 00:15:20,50
He shows a modified rifle. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS128
00:15:18,00 --> 00:15:23,50
A broad-barreled rifle. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS129
00:15:38,00 --> 00:15:43,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> notices an ax outside. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS130
00:15:42,00 --> 00:15:49,50
Now he carries the ax over his shoulder as SOMEONE<Henry> leads him through the woods. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS131
00:15:46,00 --> 00:15:54,50
Wearing his sunglasses, SOMEONE's<Abraham's> new mentor stops at a tree and gazes up the towering trunk. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS132
00:16:06,00 --> 00:16:11,50
The young man's gaze darkens. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS133
00:16:12,00 --> 00:16:17,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> plants his feet staring at the tree trunk. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS134
00:16:15,00 --> 00:16:21,50
His powerful swing cuts only a few inches in. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS135
00:16:26,00 --> 00:16:31,50
He tries again, but only chips the trunk. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS136
00:16:51,00 --> 00:17:01,50
Twisting his whole body, SOMEONE<Abraham> slices through the massive trunk. Woodchips fly from the cut and the tree topples to the ground. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS137
00:17:05,00 --> 00:17:10,50
As SOMEONE<Henry> steps away, SOMEONE<Abraham> lingers thoughtfully. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS138
00:17:08,00 --> 00:17:14,50
Now, light pours into a dark room as SOMEONE<Henry> opens its door. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS139
00:17:15,00 --> 00:17:20,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> enters with his ax. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS140
00:17:27,00 --> 00:17:33,50
SOMEONE<Henry> kicks the door shut rendering the room pitch black. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS142
00:17:33,00 --> 00:17:42,50
In the light of the now open door, SOMEONE<Henry> holds the ax while SOMEONE<Abraham> crawls toward the door his face beaten and bloody. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS143
00:17:39,00 --> 00:17:44,50
He pauses at the threshold. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS144
00:17:44,00 --> 00:17:58,50
He slams the door. Now SOMEONE<Henry> nimbly twirls the ax. Practicing later, SOMEONE<Abe> swings the ax in swirling patterns around his tall, lean frame, gaining speed with proficiency. He finishes with a mighty upward swing. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS146
00:17:58,00 --> 00:18:12,50
Now balanced on logs, SOMEONE<Abe> spars with an unarmed SOMEONE<Henry>. The protégé falls then springs to his feet. Later, SOMEONE<Henry> throws the ax. SOMEONE<Abe> catches it and splits a tree trunk. SOMEONE<Abraham> writes in his journal. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS147
00:18:24,00 --> 00:18:28,50
At a forge. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS148
00:18:29,00 --> 00:18:34,50
SOMEONE<Henry> pours silver on the ax. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS149
00:18:39,00 --> 00:18:44,50
Now in a tavern, they stand at a bar. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS150
00:18:43,00 --> 00:18:49,50
A mirror shows SOMEONE<Abe> a shadow with no one before it. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS151
00:18:50,00 --> 00:18:54,50
SOMEONE<Abe> turns. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS152
00:18:56,00 --> 00:19:02,50
SOMEONE<Abe> starts to go. SOMEONE<Henry> slams him down on the bar. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS153
00:19:05,00 --> 00:19:11,50
Later, he shows a gallery of images. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS154
00:19:17,00 --> 00:19:22,50
A cold-eyed man with Regan curls. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS155
00:19:26,00 --> 00:19:30,50
An image shows tribal lands. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS156
00:19:38,00 --> 00:19:44,50
A map highlights the southern states. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS157
00:20:07,00 --> 00:20:12,50
Springfield, 1837. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS158
00:20:25,00 --> 00:20:31,50
A man tumbles out of a shop. The keeper comes out and takes his coat. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS159
00:20:38,00 --> 00:20:49,50
As the shopkeeper storms back in, SOMEONE<Abraham> follows. Finding himself in a well-kept general store, he faces the owner who puts on a smile. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS160
00:21:19,00 --> 00:21:24,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> nods pleasantly. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS161
00:21:22,00 --> 00:21:34,50
With a polite smile, he goes. SOMEONE<Speed> turns the thief’s inside out coat back the right way then shakes out the wrinkles. He faces the window thoughtfully. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS162
00:21:31,00 --> 00:21:37,50
As SOMEONE<Abraham> reaches his horse, SOMEONE<Speed> approaches. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS163
00:21:51,00 --> 00:21:56,50
At night, SOMEONE<Abraham> writes at a desk. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS164
00:22:10,00 --> 00:22:17,50
Now, as SOMEONE<Abraham> stocks high shelves behind the shop counter. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS165
00:22:14,00 --> 00:22:19,50
A petite brunette with doll-like features comes in. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS166
00:22:18,00 --> 00:22:23,50
She shows a list written on a card. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS167
00:22:29,00 --> 00:22:33,50
SOMEONE<Abe> hops down before her. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS168
00:22:37,00 --> 00:22:42,50
She stares up at his angular features. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS169
00:22:40,00 --> 00:22:46,50
A well-dressed gentleman with ginger blonde hair enters. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS170
00:22:54,00 --> 00:22:59,50
He gives SOMEONE<Abraham> a cool smile. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS171
00:23:01,00 --> 00:23:06,50
Douglas scrutinizes the younger man. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS172
00:23:21,00 --> 00:23:28,50
Douglas faces him and his condescending smile fades. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS173
00:23:25,00 --> 00:23:31,50
SOMEONE<Mary> stares admiringly at SOMEONE<Abraham> as SOMEONE<Speed> arrives. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS174
00:23:34,00 --> 00:23:45,50
It bears a wax seal. SOMEONE<Mary> watches SOMEONE<Abraham> as he takes it behind the counter and rips it open. Small, tidy handwriting fills half the compact page. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS175
00:23:54,00 --> 00:24:01,50
SOMEONE<Mary> hands her list to him with a friendly smirk. At dusk. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS176
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:12,50
As Joshua leaves, SOMEONE<Abraham> locks up then throws down his apron and hurries to action. In his room, he slaps down the letter, dons an overcoat and gets his ax. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS177
00:24:10,00 --> 00:24:15,50
He unsheathes the silver dagger. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS178
00:24:15,00 --> 00:24:29,50
At night, we swoop low over the streets of Springfield passing smoking chimneys as lightning flashes in the distance. At the end of the street, SOMEONE<Abraham> approaches a pharmacy in his long coat and stovepipe hat. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS179
00:24:26,00 --> 00:24:32,50
Clutching the letter, he peers in through a window. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS180
00:24:30,00 --> 00:24:37,50
The young man steps inside and lets the door swing shut behind him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS181
00:24:35,00 --> 00:24:43,50
He crosses the floor between two service counters quickening his pace as he nears the back. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS182
00:24:41,00 --> 00:24:49,50
In the pharmacy workroom, a bespectacled man with sizable sideburns grinds a pestle in a mortar. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS183
00:24:53,00 --> 00:25:06,50
As he turns, SOMEONE<Abe> narrows his eyes. Stibble rests the pestle against the mortar's rim. As SOMEONE<Abe> reaches in his coat, Stibble bears his fangs. SOMEONE<Abe> charges, but the vampire throws powder. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS184
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:17,50
The dust clears revealing Stibble's distorted, monstrous features. He knocks SOMEONE<Abe> back then activates a trapdoor. The vampire hunter plunges through and a rope snare catches him around the ankle. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS185
00:25:14,00 --> 00:25:29,50
Nearby, a naked man hanging upside down shows no sign of life. We pull back to find SOMEONE<Abraham> in a room full of victims, each suspended upside down. The young hunter futile reaches for the floor. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS186
00:25:29,00 --> 00:25:36,50
Beside him, blood streams from a dying man into bowls set on the floor. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS187
00:25:34,00 --> 00:25:39,50
His ax lies beside them. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS188
00:25:36,00 --> 00:25:42,50
Arriving, Stibble kicks it away and strikes him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS189
00:25:40,00 --> 00:25:45,50
He binds SOMEONE's<Abe's> wrists. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS190
00:25:42,00 --> 00:26:00,50
As the trapped hunter looks on, the vampire opens a gleaming straight razor, turns it over and touches the blade. SOMEONE<Abraham> resumes his struggle to free himself as Stibble sharpens the blade against the porcelain bowl's ornate rim. Crouching low, the vampire slips the bowl beneath the hunter. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS191
00:26:05,00 --> 00:26:13,50
SOMEONE's<Abraham's> dagger slips from his belt. He catches it in his feet then slashes the vampire's throat. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS192
00:26:11,00 --> 00:26:25,50
Contracting his abdomen, he curls upward and cuts through the snare rope. SOMEONE<Abraham> falls to the floor, frees his wrists and retrieves his ax. As Stibble charges, he delivers a mighty upward blow. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS193
00:26:22,00 --> 00:26:30,50
Spraying blood soaks half his face. Using his hand, SOMEONE<Abraham> wipes it away with a horrified expression. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS194
00:26:28,00 --> 00:26:34,50
Later, in the misty woods, the vampire hunter digs a grave. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS195
00:26:42,00 --> 00:26:49,50
Silhouetted against the moonlit mist, SOMEONE<Abraham> puts on his stovepipe hat. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS196
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:56,50
Daytime. In the general store, SOMEONE<Abraham> uses a hand mirror as he applies sap to a swollen bruise on his cheek. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS197
00:26:53,00 --> 00:26:58,50
SOMEONE<Speed> bursts in energetically. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS198
00:27:02,00 --> 00:27:06,50
He tosses SOMEONE<Abe> a parcel. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS199
00:27:06,00 --> 00:27:11,50
SOMEONE<Abe> pulls out dress pants. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS200
00:27:17,00 --> 00:27:24,50
Wearing a tuxedo with his stovepipe hat, SOMEONE<Abraham> follows SOMEONE<Speed> into a mansion. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS201
00:27:27,00 --> 00:27:31,50
SOMEONE<Abe> slips away. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS202
00:27:39,00 --> 00:27:46,50
From across the room, SOMEONE<Mary> catches his gaze as she ignores her chattering fiancée. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS203
00:27:44,00 --> 00:27:48,50
SOMEONE<Speed> joins the couple. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS204
00:27:50,00 --> 00:27:56,50
Facing SOMEONE<Mary>, SOMEONE<Speed> discreetly jerks his head aside. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS205
00:27:53,00 --> 00:27:58,50
She turns and scans the room. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS206
00:27:55,00 --> 00:28:02,50
Beyond a circle of waltzing couples, SOMEONE<Abraham> sits snacking on nuts. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS207
00:27:59,00 --> 00:28:07,50
As SOMEONE<Mary> approaches, he puts the remainder back in a bowl and dusts his hands off on his pants. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS208
00:28:04,00 --> 00:28:10,50
She looks down at him with a sweet, coy smile. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS209
00:28:23,00 --> 00:28:30,50
Douglas notices her absence then spots her dancing with SOMEONE<Abraham>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS210
00:29:18,00 --> 00:29:25,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> twirls her. Now at the store, SOMEONE<Speed> drops a letter before him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS211
00:29:29,00 --> 00:29:45,50
In a vault, SOMEONE<Abraham> sneaks up on a banker. As he swings his ax, the man turns and vanishes. He briefly reappears baring his fangs. SOMEONE<Abraham> reaches in his pocket and throws a handful of grain. It falls to the floor. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS212
00:29:42,00 --> 00:29:48,50
He notices a door sliding open and throws another handful. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS213
00:29:45,00 --> 00:29:54,50
It hits an invisible mass. The banker reappears just long enough to strike SOMEONE's<Abe's> midsection. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS214
00:29:51,00 --> 00:29:57,50
The hunter reaches in his pocket, but finds no more grain. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS215
00:29:54,00 --> 00:30:07,50
In the dusty air, he spies a shape approaching and throws his ax. Dodging it, the charging vampire reappears. SOMEONE<Abraham> sidesteps and decapitates him on a vault shelf. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS216
00:30:04,00 --> 00:30:10,50
Later, the banker’s head lies upside down in a grave. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS217
00:30:15,00 --> 00:30:40,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> buries him amid several other graves. In a smithy, a powerfully build vampire blocks SOMEONE's<Abe's> attack and bends him back over the forge. The hunter stomps on a bellows and the blazing flame sends the vampire reeling back. SOMEONE<Abe> grabs him and thrusts his head into the fire repeatedly stomping on the bellows. Now on a picnic with SOMEONE<Mary>, SOMEONE<Abraham> dozes off spilling a cup of tea. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS218
00:30:54,00 --> 00:31:02,50
She nods. SOMEONE<Abraham> takes her cup and sets it down then takes her hands in his. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS219
00:31:08,00 --> 00:31:13,50
He leans forward, staring up at her earnestly. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS220
00:31:11,00 --> 00:31:17,50
SOMEONE<Mary> turns her head away and presses her lips together suppressing a smile. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS221
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:32,50
She smiles playfully. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS222
00:31:42,00 --> 00:31:48,50
With a modest smirk, he gives a dismissive wave. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS223
00:31:56,00 --> 00:32:05,50
That night, as SOMEONE<Mary> trots down a sidewalk, SOMEONE<Abraham> follows clapping the picnic basket lid like a yapping mouth. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS224
00:32:02,00 --> 00:32:09,50
The reach a house gate and face each other, sharing a warm smile. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS225
00:32:13,00 --> 00:32:22,50
Beaming hopefully, SOMEONE<Mary> steps closer and rises up on her toes leaning her face toward his. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS226
00:32:19,00 --> 00:32:23,50
Considerably taller. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS227
00:32:20,00 --> 00:32:26,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> takes a deep breath and makes no move to meet her. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS228
00:32:24,00 --> 00:32:30,50
SOMEONE<Mary> removes his hat, sets it on the ground and steps up on it. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS229
00:32:36,00 --> 00:32:41,50
As she leans in, he turns his cheek to her lips. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS230
00:32:49,00 --> 00:32:53,50
SOMEONE<Mary> nods. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS231
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:56,50
Taking a deep breath, she steps down and picks up his hat. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS232
00:33:05,00 --> 00:33:11,50
She manages a bright smile and heads for the house. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS233
00:33:16,00 --> 00:33:21,50
Gazing after her, SOMEONE<Abraham> trips. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS234
00:33:18,00 --> 00:33:25,50
From across the street, a one-eyed SOMEONE<Barts> leers at the tender scene. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS235
00:33:23,00 --> 00:33:29,50
Stepping forward, he sees SOMEONE<Mary> pause at the door to watch her suitor go. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS236
00:33:27,00 --> 00:33:39,50
Now in the deep South, a veiled woman rides a horse up a dirt path to a plantation house. Trees dripping with Spanish moss provide a canopy overhead. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS237
00:33:36,00 --> 00:33:43,50
Later, she strides into a dining room where SOMEONE<Adam> sits alone at a table. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS238
00:33:40,00 --> 00:33:46,50
She slaps a newspaper down before him and sits. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS239
00:33:43,00 --> 00:33:50,50
SOMEONE<Adam> ignores it. She slides the paper closer and he turns. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS240
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:55,50
Boasting strawberry blonde tresses and sultry features, SOMEONE<Vadoma> puffs a pipe. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS241
00:33:52,00 --> 00:33:58,50
Frowning, SOMEONE<Adam> takes up the paper and reads a headline. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS242
00:33:55,00 --> 00:34:03,50
Six headless bodies found near Springfield. SOMEONE<Erin> Stibble Jr among the dead. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS243
00:34:08,00 --> 00:34:13,50
Smirking, SOMEONE<Adam> lifts his brow. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS244
00:34:14,00 --> 00:34:23,50
Now in the general store, SOMEONE<Abe> reads a book. An African-American man steps inside, takes off his hat and shuts the door. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS245
00:34:41,00 --> 00:34:47,50
SOMEONE eyes the visitor from his desk 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS246
00:34:58,00 --> 00:35:04,50
Noticing a scar on the visitor's cheek, SOMEONE<Abraham> remembers. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS247
00:35:05,00 --> 00:35:10,50
He hops over the counter and hugs him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS248
00:35:32,00 --> 00:35:36,50
He takes off his apron. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS253
00:36:15,00 --> 00:36:26,50
SOMEONE<Will> ducks a swipe from the first man then SOMEONE<Abe> strikes again. Now SOMEONE<Abraham> and SOMEONE<Will> sit in a jail cell. SOMEONE<Mary> paces outside the bars. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS254
00:37:05,00 --> 00:37:11,50
She reaches through the bars and turns SOMEONE's<Abraham's> head. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS255
00:37:21,00 --> 00:37:28,50
Daytime. On a street corner, SOMEONE<Abraham> addresses a crowd from a soapbox. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS256
00:37:33,00 --> 00:37:38,50
SOMEONE<Mary> rides up in a carriage. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS257
00:37:43,00 --> 00:37:50,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> steps down from his soapbox and the crowd gathers around him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS258
00:37:48,00 --> 00:37:53,50
He walks with an older man wearing sunglasses. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS259
00:38:00,00 --> 00:38:06,50
SOMEONE<Abe> opens a carriage door and the man hands him his card. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS260
00:38:06,00 --> 00:38:13,50
SOMEONE<Nolan> climbs into his carriage then shakes SOMEONE's<Abraham's> hand. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS261
00:38:13,00 --> 00:38:20,50
The carriage rides off revealing SOMEONE<Henry>. He and SOMEONE<Abraham> walk together. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS262
00:38:27,00 --> 00:38:31,50
SOMEONE<Henry> faces SOMEONE<Abe>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS263
00:38:43,00 --> 00:38:49,50
SOMEONE<Henry> presents a silver pocket watch with an engraving. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS264
00:38:47,00 --> 00:38:52,50
A SOMEONE<Lincoln>. Time waits for no man. SOMEONE<Henry>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS265
00:38:55,00 --> 00:39:00,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> glances at his mentor then heads off. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS266
00:38:58,00 --> 00:39:02,50
He turns back. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS267
00:39:01,00 --> 00:39:06,50
The tall young man hurries away. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS269
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:12,50
Gin Creek. Our view roves toward the shipping warehouse across the dock. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS270
00:39:12,00 --> 00:39:20,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> sidles around the exterior of the building, his silver tipped ax in hand. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS271
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:21,50
He stops at a corner. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS272
00:39:19,00 --> 00:39:24,50
Returning from a corral, SOMEONE<Barts> throws down a pitchfork. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS273
00:39:23,00 --> 00:39:28,50
He stops and sniffs the air. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS274
00:39:26,00 --> 00:39:31,50
Grimacing, he takes of his sunglasses. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS275
00:39:33,00 --> 00:39:38,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> attacks. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS276
00:39:36,00 --> 00:39:40,50
SOMEONE<Barts> backs away. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS277
00:39:39,00 --> 00:39:51,50
He flees among his frightened horses. An aerial view shows the herd crossing a riverside field. As the vampire runs up ahead, SOMEONE<Abraham> mounts one of the horses. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS278
00:39:51,00 --> 00:39:59,50
SOMEONE<Barts> leaps forward between two horses, grabs onto their necks and hangs between them. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS279
00:39:58,00 --> 00:40:22,50
He slams the horses into the ground and they tumble across the dirt obstructing SOMEONE's<Abraham's> path. As SOMEONE<Abraham> jumps one of the horses, he falls off his own. He rolls to a stop and stands up to find himself facing the oncoming stampede. A horse brushes past him and he staggers. A second and third knock him around. He spots SOMEONE<Barts> leaping over the herd. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS280
00:40:20,00 --> 00:40:26,50
The vampire tackles him and bares his fangs. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS281
00:40:24,00 --> 00:40:31,50
SOMEONE<Abe> blocks him with the shaft of his ax. They both see a horse charging straight for them. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS282
00:40:28,00 --> 00:40:52,50
The stallion knocks SOMEONE<Barts> off SOMEONE<Abraham> sending him tumbling across the dirt. The vampire rises to his feet. He boldly grabs the front leg of an oncoming horse, flipping the steed on its back. Using the horse like a track and field hammer, he hurls it at his enemy knocking him to the ground. Amid the chaos of the stampede, the horse rises with SOMEONE<Abraham> on its back. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS283
00:40:49,00 --> 00:41:06,50
The vampire hunter rides on leaning down for his ax as he passes. Up ahead, SOMEONE<Barts> bounds off the back of two horses and mounts a third. SOMEONE<Abraham> nears his target holding his ax at the ready. SOMEONE<Barts> glances back over his shoulder. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS284
00:41:03,00 --> 00:41:22,50
He ducks the swing of the ax. SOMEONE<Abraham> leans back as SOMEONE<Barts> throws a roundhouse kick. The vampire grabs the ax and flips SOMEONE<Abraham> on to the back of another horse. As SOMEONE<Abe> mounts the horse, he sees SOMEONE<Barts> run off across the backs of the herd. SOMEONE<Abraham> attempts to stand on his horse's back. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS286
00:41:22,00 --> 00:41:36,50
He rises to his feet then runs after the vampire landing on a new horse's back with every daring step. Through a veil of wafting dust, we glimpse SOMEONE<Barts> as he looks back and grins. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS287
00:41:33,00 --> 00:41:55,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> lunges at him swiping at his legs, but the vampire jumps, flips and lands on a horse behind SOMEONE<Abraham>. He tries to bite SOMEONE's<Abraham's> exposed neck, but the vampire hunter blocks the bite with his ax and pushes them off the horse. SOMEONE<Barts> clings to SOMEONE's<Abraham's> boot as the herd runs alongside a bluff. He lets go. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS288
00:41:53,00 --> 00:42:11,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> falls off the horse and tumbles down the face of the bluff. Rolling to a stop, he loses his ax. SOMEONE<Barts> pounces on him and bares his hideous fangs. SOMEONE's<Abe's> spots his weapon and reaches for it, but SOMEONE<Barts> stomps the handle flipping the ax into the air. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS289
00:42:08,00 --> 00:42:27,50
The vampire grabs the ax and nearly splits SOMEONE's<Abe's> face. SOMEONE<Abe> grabs the shaft, extends it to reveal a hidden trigger, then shoots SOMEONE<Barts> through his good eye. SOMEONE<Barts> lands on his back. Standing over him, SOMEONE<Abe> collapses his modified weapon and readies himself for a final strike. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS290
00:42:42,00 --> 00:42:50,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> brings down his ax. Now at night, a man forces a young woman through a narrow alley. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS291
00:42:48,00 --> 00:42:53,50
He slams her against a brick wall clutching her throat. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS292
00:42:58,00 --> 00:43:04,50
Behind the man, SOMEONE<Henry> steps out from a shadowy recess across the alley. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS293
00:43:02,00 --> 00:43:09,50
With a calm, deliberate gaze, he nears the rapist's exposed neck and takes a bite. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS294
00:43:10,00 --> 00:43:18,50
As the vampire brings his flailing victim down, the young woman escapes down the alley. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS295
00:43:15,00 --> 00:43:22,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> steps out from around a corner and catches his bloodsucking mentor in the act. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS296
00:43:24,00 --> 00:43:28,50
SOMEONE<Henry> meets his gaze. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS298
00:43:26,00 --> 00:43:32,50
He rises from his victim and holds up his hands. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS299
00:43:29,00 --> 00:43:34,50
Cautiously, he approaches SOMEONE<Abraham>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS300
00:43:36,00 --> 00:43:41,50
SOMEONE<Abe> throws his ax, but SOMEONE<Henry> catches it. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS301
00:43:40,00 --> 00:43:46,50
SOMEONE<Abe> kicks him down and swing, but SOMEONE<Henry> grabs the ax once more. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS302
00:43:54,00 --> 00:44:01,50
In a flashback, on a tree-lined road, SOMEONE<Henry> hops out of his carriage and takes a look at its wheel. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS303
00:44:06,00 --> 00:44:13,50
As he kisses a woman leaning out of the window, he notices a team of riders approaching. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS304
00:44:13,00 --> 00:44:19,50
The dark haired woman sits back and SOMEONE<Henry> hands her a gun. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS305
00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:21,50
He draws a dagger. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS306
00:44:21,00 --> 00:44:32,50
As SOMEONE<Henry> approaches the group, a rider hops down from his horse and disappears. As the others look on, the unshaven man holds his ground awaiting the imminent attack. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS308
00:44:33,00 --> 00:44:45,50
The vampire appears and SOMEONE<Henry> dodges a swipe. He ducks another, then slashes his attacker's masked mouth creating a spectacular spray of gore. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS309
00:44:42,00 --> 00:45:03,50
A mildly frustrated SOMEONE<Adam> dismounts. SOMEONE<Henry> tries to stab his attacker, but the vampire clutches his wrist. He drops his dagger, catches it with his free hand, then slashes and leg sweeps his foe. He slashes a second attacker's kicking leg, then drives his blade through the vampire's palm and flips him onto his back. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS310
00:45:02,00 --> 00:45:30,50
SOMEONE<Adam> nears. SOMEONE<Henry> attacks, but the seasoned vampire deflects his every strike. He kicks the human in the face. In slow motion, SOMEONE<Henry> twirls through the air and lands at SOMEONE's<Adam's> feet. The vampire takes off his sunglasses revealing his puffy eyes. SOMEONE<Henry> kicks out SOMEONE's<Adam's> shin and the vampire almost falls on his dagger. From behind, SOMEONE's<Henry's> love attacks SOMEONE<Adam>, but two minions seize her. SOMEONE<Adam> grabs SOMEONE<Henry> from behind, exposes his neck and sinks his teeth in. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS311
00:45:32,00 --> 00:45:38,50
SOMEONE<Adam> looks up from his trembling victim, his mouth dripping with blood. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS312
00:45:36,00 --> 00:45:42,50
He grabs a tuft of SOMEONE's<Henry's> hair and lowers him to his knee. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS314
00:45:43,00 --> 00:45:55,50
As SOMEONE<Adam> crosses to the dark haired woman, a dazed SOMEONE<Henry> rises to his feet but struggles to maintain his balance. He watches SOMEONE<Adam> wrap his arms around her. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS315
00:45:52,00 --> 00:45:59,50
Sinking his teeth into her neck, he spins her around lifting her off her feet. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS316
00:45:57,00 --> 00:46:02,50
SOMEONE's<Henry's> eyes roll back. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS317
00:45:59,00 --> 00:46:06,50
He watches the attack in a stupor, his jaw hanging slack. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS318
00:46:03,00 --> 00:46:10,50
SOMEONE<Adam> slows his spin to a stop then let's his victim sink to the ground. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS319
00:46:09,00 --> 00:46:14,50
Trembling, face down, SOMEONE<Henry> watches his dead love. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS320
00:46:11,00 --> 00:46:17,50
With his boot, SOMEONE<Adam> rolls her on her back. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS321
00:46:19,00 --> 00:46:23,50
SOMEONE<Adam> shakes his head. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS322
00:46:21,00 --> 00:46:37,50
Baring his newfound fangs, SOMEONE<Henry> grabs his dagger and charges the vampire. He goes to strike, but his arm stops mid-stab. With both hands, he swipes at SOMEONE<Adam> and attempts to stab him in the heart, but an unseen force holds the blade back. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS323
00:46:45,00 --> 00:46:51,50
SOMEONE<Henry> lowers his demoralized gaze. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS324
00:46:50,00 --> 00:46:55,50
SOMEONE<Adam> leaves him standing alone. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS325
00:46:54,00 --> 00:47:01,50
SOMEONE<Henry> glances back at the riders then goes to his love's side. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS326
00:46:58,00 --> 00:47:04,50
He gently turns her face to his own and kisses her on the lips. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS327
00:47:02,00 --> 00:47:06,50
Back in the present. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS328
00:47:11,00 --> 00:47:17,50
Beside SOMEONE<Henry>, SOMEONE<Abraham> rises to his feet. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS329
00:47:16,00 --> 00:47:21,50
The seated vampire meets his gaze. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS330
00:47:20,00 --> 00:47:27,50
As SOMEONE<Abraham> walks away, a flash of lightning brightens the alley's walls. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS331
00:47:24,00 --> 00:47:30,50
Now through a downpour, the tall, young man crosses a street. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS332
00:47:28,00 --> 00:47:32,50
Wearing his top hat and overcoat. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS333
00:47:36,00 --> 00:47:44,50
He steps onto a curb and crosses a sidewalk heading for the general store. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS334
00:47:42,00 --> 00:47:48,50
As he unlocks the front door, someone approaches him from behind. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS335
00:47:49,00 --> 00:47:55,50
As SOMEONE<Abraham> looks up from the door, a hooded figure nears. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS336
00:47:54,00 --> 00:47:59,50
Pulling his ax from his jacket, he turns to strike. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS337
00:48:21,00 --> 00:48:26,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> reaches into his jacket. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS338
00:48:25,00 --> 00:48:31,50
SOMEONE<Mary> watches as he takes a knee and holds up a ring. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS339
00:48:40,00 --> 00:48:45,50
Gazing at the ring, she takes a deep breath. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS340
00:48:43,00 --> 00:48:50,50
As SOMEONE<Mary> offers her hand, SOMEONE<Abraham> rises to his feet and puts the ring on her finger. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS341
00:48:49,00 --> 00:48:56,50
They share a loving smile then SOMEONE<Abraham> cradles SOMEONE's<Mary's> cheeks. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS342
00:48:54,00 --> 00:49:00,50
She rests her hands on his shoulders and they kiss. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS343
00:48:58,00 --> 00:49:04,50
The tall, young man lifts his fiancée into his arms. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS345
00:49:03,00 --> 00:49:09,50
He carries her off leaving his ax behind. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS346
00:49:06,00 --> 00:49:11,50
Now at an intimate wedding ceremony. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS347
00:49:33,00 --> 00:49:39,50
Holding hands, SOMEONE<Mary> and SOMEONE<Abraham> kiss. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS348
00:49:37,00 --> 00:49:44,50
Later, the smiling bride and groom clink their glasses and sip champagne. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS349
00:49:42,00 --> 00:49:46,50
SOMEONE<Henry> shakes SOMEONE's<Will's> hand. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS350
00:49:49,00 --> 00:49:53,50
SOMEONE<Speed> looks on. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS351
00:50:19,00 --> 00:50:24,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> kisses SOMEONE<Mary> on the cheek. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS352
00:50:22,00 --> 00:50:27,50
He and SOMEONE<Henry> step aside. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS353
00:50:37,00 --> 00:50:44,50
At a dock, SOMEONE<Adam> runs his gloved hand over the top of a wooden casket. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS354
00:50:41,00 --> 00:50:48,50
SOMEONE<Vadoma> stands nearby, as do several masked vampires. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS355
00:50:47,00 --> 00:50:52,50
SOMEONE<Adam> opens the casket revealing SOMEONE<Barts> inside. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS356
00:50:50,00 --> 00:50:58,50
He removes a red rose petal from one of the slain vampire's eyes then notices something in his hand. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS357
00:50:56,00 --> 00:51:04,50
SOMEONE<Adam> turns SOMEONE'<Barts'> hand palm up and pries his fingers from SOMEONE's<Abraham's> pocket watch. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS358
00:51:02,00 --> 00:51:07,50
He slams the casket's lid. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS359
00:51:06,00 --> 00:51:12,50
The vampires wait as their brooding leader steps away from the casket. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS360
00:51:11,00 --> 00:51:15,50
SOMEONE<Adam> stops and gazes thoughtfully. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS361
00:51:13,00 --> 00:51:18,50
He turns back and ambles over to SOMEONE<Vadoma>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS362
00:51:35,00 --> 00:51:40,50
Now a carriage arrives at a building. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS363
00:51:37,00 --> 00:51:43,50
SOMEONE<Vadoma> rides inside wearing a veil. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS364
00:51:40,00 --> 00:51:45,50
SOMEONE<Speed> leaves SOMEONE<Will> with a book. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS365
00:51:45,00 --> 00:51:52,50
As he heads off, SOMEONE<Will> reads from the book leaning against the wall. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS366
00:51:51,00 --> 00:51:57,50
One of the two men steps down beside SOMEONE<Will> then clubs him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS367
00:51:56,00 --> 00:52:01,50
Now SOMEONE<Speed> finds SOMEONE<Abraham> in his study. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS368
00:52:00,00 --> 00:52:06,50
SOMEONE<Speed> takes a seat and hands SOMEONE<Abraham> the book. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS369
00:52:06,00 --> 00:52:14,50
He finds a flowery invitation inside. SOMEONE<Abraham> quickly gathers his jacket and hat. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS370
00:52:17,00 --> 00:52:21,50
Now on a boat. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS371
00:52:36,00 --> 00:52:48,50
They stand on the deck of their humble vessel as it approaches a fleet of steam-powered riverboats crowding a bustling harbor. Pillars of black smoke plume skyward for miles. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS372
00:52:46,00 --> 00:52:50,50
New Orleans. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS373
00:52:47,00 --> 00:52:58,50
Now, Spanish moss hangs low from the branches of surrounding trees as SOMEONE<Abraham> and SOMEONE<Speed> ride a modest horse drawn carriage up a narrow path. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS374
00:52:55,00 --> 00:53:02,50
On either side, wooden shacks show no sign of inhabitance. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS375
00:53:05,00 --> 00:53:10,50
A pot hangs over a stack of firewood. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS376
00:53:08,00 --> 00:53:17,50
From inside a shack, a mocha-skinned woman with a head-kerchief wields a rifle as she peers out through a gap in the wood slat wall. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS377
00:53:15,00 --> 00:53:21,50
At night, the carriage approaches the plantation house. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS378
00:53:18,00 --> 00:53:25,50
The moonlit Spanish moss over their head sways eerily in a breeze. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS380
00:53:22,00 --> 00:53:31,50
Now, a window reflects burning candles and frames SOMEONE<Abraham> and SOMEONE<Speed> as they walk up to the house. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS381
00:53:28,00 --> 00:53:35,50
Peering in, they find white people waltzing with slaves at a ball. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS382
00:53:32,00 --> 00:53:38,50
Among them, SOMEONE<Will> recoils from SOMEONE<Vadoma> as she holds him tight. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS383
00:53:49,00 --> 00:53:54,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> draws his ax. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS384
00:53:52,00 --> 00:53:57,50
He hurries away. Inside. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS385
00:53:58,00 --> 00:54:03,50
SOMEONE<Vadoma> lunges at SOMEONE<Will> baring her fangs. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS386
00:54:01,00 --> 00:54:13,50
As SOMEONE<Speed> stares, the vampires attack the slaves. SOMEONE<Will> wrenches free, but the shy woman succumbs to a vicious bite. SOMEONE<Adam> watches pleasurably. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS387
00:54:10,00 --> 00:54:22,50
As SOMEONE<Will> fight off the attacker, slaves all around him fall victim to the vamps. Two grab SOMEONE<Will>. SOMEONE<Abraham> kicks open the door and races in as a few survivors flee. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS388
00:54:19,00 --> 00:54:33,50
Seated in a chair, SOMEONE<Adam> smirks while two of his underlings hold SOMEONE<Will> on his knees. One story up, two vampires in a mural turn. They leap from a ledge in front of the painting and claw the wood floor. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS389
00:54:31,00 --> 00:54:40,50
Charging, they disappear. SOMEONE<Abe> throws his hat at one then strikes him down. He takes down the other in a single strike. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS390
00:54:38,00 --> 00:55:09,50
Swinging at a third, SOMEONE<Abe> drops his ax. He delivers a powerful roundhouse kick as more and more vampires join the fray, a staring SOMEONE<Speed> backs away from the window. One vampire seizes SOMEONE's<Abe's> ax. The hunter kicks him away and twirls it into an upward swing taking out one vamp after another. Looking on, SOMEONE<Will> discreetly works through ropes binding his wrists. An invisible vampire grabs a sword then materializes to attack. SOMEONE<Abe> disarms him, but three more surround him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS391
00:55:08,00 --> 00:55:18,50
As he swings at one, it vanishes. Another swipes his claws. SOMEONE<Abe> ducks them then embeds his ax in the creature's abdomen. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS392
00:55:15,00 --> 00:55:23,50
In slow motion, he wrenches the weapon out sending a splash of blood through the air. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS393
00:55:20,00 --> 00:55:46,50
As he finishes the vampire off, SOMEONE<Will> frees himself and fights off his captor. SOMEONE<Vadoma> kicks him into a pillar splintering its wood. Propelling himself off another pillar, SOMEONE<Abraham> takes out two vamps in a single swing. SOMEONE<Vadoma> stalks towards him as he fights a third. SOMEONE<Abe> beheads his foe and finds SOMEONE<Vadoma> in pants, swirling her long skirt like a cape. Slicing through it he finds her gone. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS394
00:55:44,00 --> 00:55:59,50
From behind, she kicks him to the floor as SOMEONE<Adam> throws her a chair. She backflips through the air catches it and lands in the seat on top of SOMEONE<Abraham>. Straddling the chair, she peers down at his face. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS395
00:55:57,00 --> 00:56:02,50
She pins his arms beneath her boot. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS396
00:56:25,00 --> 00:56:32,50
The high mural becomes an animated depiction of slavery throughout world history. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS397
00:57:01,00 --> 00:57:06,50
He crouches beside SOMEONE<Vadoma>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS398
00:57:44,00 --> 00:57:49,50
Standing, SOMEONE<Adam> steps away. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS399
00:57:58,00 --> 00:58:03,50
A vamp holds SOMEONE<Will>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS400
00:58:06,00 --> 00:58:10,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> struggles. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS401
00:58:10,00 --> 00:58:15,50
SOMEONE<Adam> puts a dagger to SOMEONE's<Will's> throat. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS402
00:58:17,00 --> 00:58:23,50
The horse drawn carriage crashes through a window. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS403
00:58:20,00 --> 00:58:30,50
SOMEONE<Will> fights free as SOMEONE<Speed> drives in. The carriage skids in blood knocking SOMEONE<Vadoma> off of SOMEONE<Abe>. He grabs his ax. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS404
00:58:27,00 --> 00:58:39,50
He and SOMEONE<Will> catch up to the carriage and climb on to the back. It loses a wheel as it speeds out, but continues down the dirt path. Later, they run. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS405
00:58:37,00 --> 00:58:41,50
They halt in their tracks. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS406
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:43,50
A team of horsemen approach. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS407
00:58:42,00 --> 00:58:47,50
The mocha-skinned woman rows a raft. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS408
00:58:47,00 --> 00:59:01,50
The three man dash from the riverbank and find the raft waiting for them. Trees hide them as the horsemen ride past with a colony of bats swooping overhead. On the raft, the men and their rescuer duck low. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS409
00:58:58,00 --> 00:59:05,50
As the danger passes, SOMEONE<Will> stands and takes up the long poled oar. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS410
00:59:05,00 --> 00:59:11,50
At dawn, we gaze out over the winding bayou. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS411
00:59:10,00 --> 00:59:17,50
Later, the raft arrives at a shore facing a stately brick church. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS412
00:59:14,00 --> 00:59:19,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> gets off first and helps the others. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS413
00:59:17,00 --> 00:59:23,50
He and SOMEONE<Will> pull the raft up on shore then follow the woman with SOMEONE<Speed>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS414
00:59:22,00 --> 00:59:27,50
A pastor comes out to meet them. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS415
00:59:26,00 --> 00:59:31,50
Now as SOMEONE<Abraham> climbs into an attic. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS416
00:59:28,00 --> 00:59:33,50
SOMEONE<Will> offers a hand to help him up. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS417
00:59:30,00 --> 00:59:36,50
Runaway slaves fill the cramped, dusty space. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS418
00:59:33,00 --> 00:59:40,50
Many slumber, lie down on unused pews while some curl up on the floor. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS419
00:59:37,00 --> 00:59:42,50
A baby lies in a makeshift cradle. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS420
00:59:46,00 --> 00:59:53,50
SOMEONE<Abe> and SOMEONE<Speed> go to a shuttered window and peer through while Tubman takes up her rifle. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS421
00:59:59,00 --> 01:00:03,50
SOMEONE<Speed> bumps a bell. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS422
01:00:01,00 --> 01:00:05,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Vadoma> looks up. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS423
01:00:07,00 --> 01:00:13,50
As SOMEONE<Abe> looks on anxiously, SOMEONE<Vadoma> waves the search team on. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS424
01:00:11,00 --> 01:00:17,50
He relaxes and faces Speed who sighs. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS425
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:19,50
SOMEONE<Will> bounces the baby, soothing it. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS426
01:00:16,00 --> 01:00:23,50
Craning her neck, Tubman regards the newcomers with a furrowed brow. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS427
01:00:35,00 --> 01:00:46,50
Now in the rain, protesters hold up pro- and anti-slavery signs. SOMEONE<Henry> works his way through the crowd. Inside, SOMEONE<Abraham> debates Douglas. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS428
01:01:14,00 --> 01:01:21,50
Later, SOMEONE<Will> stands by as SOMEONE<Henry> paces the empty chamber. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS429
01:01:44,00 --> 01:01:51,50
The men turn. SOMEONE<Mary> comes in and greets the men with a crisp smile. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS430
01:01:53,00 --> 01:01:59,50
SOMEONE<Henry> shoots a cutting look at SOMEONE<Abe> who lowers his gaze. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS433
01:02:07,00 --> 01:02:12,50
SOMEONE<Abe> twirls his ax. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS434
01:02:22,00 --> 01:02:27,50
SOMEONE<Abe> lays the ax in a chest. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS435
01:02:27,00 --> 01:02:36,50
Now, our view spirals from sideways to upright as a door opens and a tall, silhouetted figure strides through. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS436
01:02:34,00 --> 01:02:46,50
Clad in a trim long coat and the famous stovepipe hat, SOMEONE marches resolutely towards us. As he draws near, we find him aged and distinguished. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS437
01:02:43,00 --> 01:02:52,50
Sporting his trademark presidential beard. Now before the Capitol with its dome under construction. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS438
01:03:05,00 --> 01:03:25,50
As a canon fires, words appear: Fort Sumter, 1861. Within the fort, Union and Confederate troops clash in a chaotic battle as smoke fills the air. A bearded Union General leads a charge. Now, the wall of a toy fort topples as a young boy plays in the Oval Office. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS439
01:03:37,00 --> 01:03:43,50
As SOMEONE<Abe> reads a letter, SOMEONE<Will> arrives. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS440
01:03:43,00 --> 01:03:48,50
The men turn and the boy looks up from his play. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS441
01:03:46,00 --> 01:03:52,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> lowers his troubled gaze and SOMEONE<Will> steps away. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS442
01:03:50,00 --> 01:03:57,50
A gracefully aging SOMEONE<Mary> approaches the desk with a meal on a tray. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS443
01:04:01,00 --> 01:04:08,50
She plants her hands on her hips and her gaze falls on a headline. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS444
01:04:05,00 --> 01:04:10,50
20,000 soldiers dead. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS445
01:04:07,00 --> 01:04:13,50
SOMEONE<Abe> shifts his sorrowful gaze and SOMEONE<Mary> heads out. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS446
01:04:11,00 --> 01:04:16,50
The young boy follows his mother. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS447
01:04:15,00 --> 01:04:20,50
The child pauses. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS448
01:04:18,00 --> 01:04:25,50
Turning around, he returns to his father's desk and kisses his sunken cheek. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS449
01:04:24,00 --> 01:04:30,50
The boy goes to his namesake who kisses his cheek. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS450
01:04:28,00 --> 01:04:34,50
Beaming shyly, the little boy leaves with a jaunty stride. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS451
01:04:31,00 --> 01:04:38,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> gazes after him lovingly as SOMEONE<Will> tosses down a paper. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS452
01:04:41,00 --> 01:04:47,50
The Emancipation Proclamation lies before him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS453
01:04:46,00 --> 01:04:52,50
He signs it. Now before Congress. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS454
01:05:01,00 --> 01:05:05,50
Outside the Capitol. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS455
01:05:17,00 --> 01:05:24,50
Now in the White House, a maid uses a feather duster on a clock. It's SOMEONE<Vadoma>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS456
01:05:21,00 --> 01:05:27,50
Later, she smiles and nods demurely as she passes SOMEONE<Mary>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS457
01:05:26,00 --> 01:05:32,50
SOMEONE<Mary> pauses briefly looking over her shoulder at the sultry woman. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS458
01:05:30,00 --> 01:05:38,50
SOMEONE<Vadoma> slips into a bedroom where SOMEONE<Willie> wears a Union uniform as he plays with toy soldiers. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS459
01:05:38,00 --> 01:05:42,50
She shuts the door. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS460
01:05:46,00 --> 01:05:51,50
Coming close, SOMEONE<Vadoma> lays down on her stomach. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS461
01:05:48,00 --> 01:05:54,50
Props herself on her elbows and chats sweetly with the child. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS462
01:05:52,00 --> 01:05:57,50
As he answers her, she glances over her shoulder. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS463
01:05:56,00 --> 01:06:03,50
SOMEONE<Willie> blows a toy horn and they share a mirthful smile. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS464
01:06:00,00 --> 01:06:07,50
His hand close to hers, he presents a gleaming toy sword made of silver. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS465
01:06:08,00 --> 01:06:15,50
She takes his hand and kisses his wrist. The toy sword drops to the carpet. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS466
01:06:13,00 --> 01:06:19,50
Now SOMEONE<Abraham> comes in as SOMEONE<Willie> lies sick in bed. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS467
01:06:19,00 --> 01:06:34,50
Sitting with SOMEONE<Mary> on the bed, he notices dark, swollen veins branching from a bite on the boy's wrist. SOMEONE's<Abraham's> eyes widen and he stands. Watching him, SOMEONE<Mary> notices his stricken gaze as he looks away. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS468
01:06:39,00 --> 01:06:45,50
Stepping away, SOMEONE<Abraham> crosses to a sunlit window. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS469
01:06:44,00 --> 01:06:49,50
SOMEONE<Mary> turns and faces him questioningly. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS470
01:06:47,00 --> 01:06:55,50
Staring off, SOMEONE<Abraham> remembers his dying mother writhing as her eyes rolled back in her head. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS471
01:06:54,00 --> 01:07:00,50
Now the President wakes in a chair at SOMEONE's<Willie's> bedside. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS472
01:06:59,00 --> 01:07:07,50
Stretching, he finds SOMEONE<Mary> sleeping on the bed cradling their son in her arms. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS473
01:07:05,00 --> 01:07:11,50
Moving gingerly, SOMEONE<Abraham> gets to his feet. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS474
01:07:11,00 --> 01:07:16,50
His gaze lands on a spot on the carpet. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS475
01:07:14,00 --> 01:07:20,50
He drapes his jacket over SOMEONE<Willie> like a blanket. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS476
01:07:17,00 --> 01:07:24,50
Then crouches at his toys. The silver pocket watch gleams among them. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS477
01:07:24,00 --> 01:07:31,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> picks it up and opens it revealing SOMEONE's<Henry's> personalized inscription. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS478
01:07:31,00 --> 01:07:36,50
He lifts his stunned gaze. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS479
01:07:35,00 --> 01:07:42,50
Now, SOMEONE<Will> steps out onto a balcony on a beautiful day and pauses. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS480
01:07:42,00 --> 01:07:47,50
Turning, he finds SOMEONE<Abraham> sitting on the concrete. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS481
01:07:45,00 --> 01:07:50,50
His long legs stretched out before him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS482
01:07:47,00 --> 01:07:52,50
He slumps dejectedly against a pillar. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS483
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:58,50
SOMEONE<Will> crosses to his lifelong friend and drapes his jacket around his shoulders. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS484
01:07:57,00 --> 01:08:03,50
Stepping in front of SOMEONE<Abe>, he crouches and touches his arm. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS485
01:08:01,00 --> 01:08:08,50
SOMEONE<Will> offers a sympathetic gaze, then straightens and stands over him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS486
01:08:10,00 --> 01:08:14,50
The President looks up at him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS487
01:08:14,00 --> 01:08:20,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> draws a deep knowing breath and gazes off. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS488
01:08:19,00 --> 01:08:26,50
Nighttime. A carriage rides past the mist-enshrouded White House. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS489
01:08:23,00 --> 01:08:30,50
In the presidential home, SOMEONE<Abraham> kneels at SOMEONE's<Willie's> bed in prayer. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS490
01:08:27,00 --> 01:08:33,50
Before him, the lifeless child wears a dark suit. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS491
01:08:30,00 --> 01:08:35,50
His hands clasped demurely. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS492
01:08:32,00 --> 01:08:39,50
SOMEONE<Henry> comes in and sinks to his knees at the other side of the bed. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS493
01:08:39,00 --> 01:08:46,50
The President lifts his head staring off as he rubs his thumbs together. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS494
01:09:11,00 --> 01:09:18,50
Looking past SOMEONE<Henry>, SOMEONE<Abraham> finds SOMEONE<Mary> arriving in the doorway dressed in mourning. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS495
01:09:21,00 --> 01:09:26,50
SOMEONE<Abe> stands. SOMEONE<Mary> nods wearily. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS496
01:10:01,00 --> 01:10:05,50
She beats his chest. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS497
01:10:06,00 --> 01:10:12,50
Overwhelmed with sobs, SOMEONE<Mary> rushes from the room. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS498
01:10:09,00 --> 01:10:14,50
SOMEONE<Henry> starts to go then pauses in the doorway. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS499
01:10:28,00 --> 01:10:35,50
SOMEONE's<Abraham's> eyes widen and he lowers his remorseful gaze. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS500
01:10:33,00 --> 01:10:40,50
Now a photographer stands in the middle of a field littered with the bodies of Union soldiers. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS501
01:10:42,00 --> 01:10:46,50
In the Oval Office. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS502
01:10:57,00 --> 01:11:03,50
Leaving the room, he hands over a telegram order. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS503
01:11:01,00 --> 01:11:08,50
On SOMEONE's<Adam's> plantation, we zoom up the path leading to his door. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS504
01:11:05,00 --> 01:11:11,50
It opens as he walks out a man with a bearded chin. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS505
01:11:18,00 --> 01:11:23,50
A servant brings red beverages. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS506
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:26,50
SOMEONE<Adam> takes up the goblets. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS507
01:11:27,00 --> 01:11:31,50
SOMEONE<Adam> returns a goblet. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS508
01:11:33,00 --> 01:11:41,50
Sipping his drink, SOMEONE<Adam> spits it out. Splotches of red stain a war map in his hand. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS509
01:11:39,00 --> 01:11:55,50
Our view zooms in on a red stain north of Gettysburg which becomes a smoking field beneath an overcast sky. Swooping low, we find Confederate soldiers charging recklessly over the grass as cannon balls touch down all around them. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS510
01:11:53,00 --> 01:11:59,50
Union soldiers fire the canons from a high ridge. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS511
01:11:56,00 --> 01:12:16,50
As a cannonball touches down with a stories high blast, Confederate soldier march straight towards it. A row of cannon barrels amid smoke and sparks as they fire. In the infantry below, a thin Union soldier clutches a photo of a woman as he stands by the bearded General. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS512
01:12:17,00 --> 01:12:23,50
The thin soldier aims a rifle with his brothers-in-arms. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS513
01:12:22,00 --> 01:12:28,50
A cannon ball blasts behind the Confederates. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS514
01:12:25,00 --> 01:12:36,50
One or two fall, but the rest charge on seemingly unharmed by the bullets. They drop their rifles. The thin soldier faces his General. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS516
01:12:36,00 --> 01:12:53,50
A pale Confederate runs on despite a blood spraying chest wound and a bullet through his hand. Another bears his fangs. As the General shoots, the Confederates vanish. A force knocks his head off and his men fall behind him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS517
01:12:50,00 --> 01:12:55,50
A Confederate flag topples to the ground. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS518
01:12:53,00 --> 01:13:00,50
The General turns and finds the thin soldier spitting up blood beside him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS519
01:12:57,00 --> 01:13:06,50
He holds up a shaking hand and a shaft of light shining through a hole in his chest hits his palm. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS520
01:13:03,00 --> 01:13:09,50
He sinks to his knees then keels over. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS521
01:13:06,00 --> 01:13:13,50
Turning, the General finds every man in his unit sprawled on the ground. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS522
01:13:11,00 --> 01:13:21,50
The thin soldier's photograph of his sweetheart flutters down to the grass. The General stares at the departing Confederates. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS523
01:13:19,00 --> 01:13:25,50
Now SOMEONE<Abraham> and SOMEONE<Mary> dine at opposite ends of a long table. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS524
01:13:36,00 --> 01:13:42,50
SOMEONE's<Mary's> sips her drink and takes up her soupspoon. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS525
01:14:12,00 --> 01:14:18,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> turns the silver utensil in his hand. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS526
01:14:15,00 --> 01:14:23,50
SOMEONE<Mary> watches him with wide eyes. The President springs up from his seat. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS527
01:14:26,00 --> 01:14:30,50
He shows the utensil. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS528
01:14:36,00 --> 01:15:00,50
Now, Union soldiers move in and out of wealthy residences bringing out bulging sacks and armloads of silver items. As we peer down through the clouds, we find carts loaded with silver twinkling in the sunlight as they travel through the streets. SOMEONE<Henry> enters his house and peers out a window through his sunglasses. Now, Speed rides in a carriage with SOMEONE<Vadoma>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS529
01:15:14,00 --> 01:15:19,50
SOMEONE<Speed> eyes the vampire uneasily. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS530
01:15:17,00 --> 01:15:23,50
In a factory, SOMEONE<Abe> watches workers melt the silver. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS531
01:15:25,00 --> 01:15:32,50
SOMEONE<Speed> joins him at a high railing overlooking the work floor. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS532
01:15:32,00 --> 01:15:42,50
The molten silver churns in enormous vats. SOMEONE<Speed> faces his old friend who looks down with a thoughtful gaze. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS533
01:15:39,00 --> 01:15:45,50
Now fog drifts over the White House lawn at dusk. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS534
01:15:42,00 --> 01:15:49,50
In SOMEONE's<Willie's> room, SOMEONE<Mary> lies in the small bed in a demure white nightgown. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS535
01:15:46,00 --> 01:15:53,50
She keeps her melancholy gaze averted as SOMEONE<Abraham> arrives. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS536
01:15:50,00 --> 01:15:55,50
He sits close, his back to her. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS537
01:16:02,00 --> 01:16:11,50
SOMEONE's<Mary's> expression softens as she stares towards the windows, one hand tucked behind her head. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS538
01:16:10,00 --> 01:16:15,50
She rolls her head to face him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS539
01:16:12,00 --> 01:16:19,50
SOMEONE<Mary> sits up, her long hair hanging loose around her shoulders. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS540
01:16:16,00 --> 01:16:22,50
SOMEONE<Abe> turns over his shoulder to meet her gaze. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS541
01:16:23,00 --> 01:16:28,50
Wearing a vulnerable frown, she takes a deep breath. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS542
01:16:26,00 --> 01:16:32,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> slumps regretfully then puts his arms around her. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS543
01:16:29,00 --> 01:16:36,50
The aging couple lies back on the bed in a warm embrace. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS544
01:16:33,00 --> 01:16:40,50
SOMEONE<Mary> fingers SOMEONE's<Willie's> toy sword as SOMEONE<Abe> cups her hand in his. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS546
01:16:43,00 --> 01:16:47,50
SOMEONE<Mary> hosts her in the dining room. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS547
01:17:01,00 --> 01:17:06,50
Now the attic door opens. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS548
01:17:03,00 --> 01:17:11,50
Light pours in past SOMEONE<Abraham> as he stands in the doorway staring at the now dust coated chest. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS549
01:17:11,00 --> 01:17:17,50
He crosses to it slowly taking out a key. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS550
01:17:20,00 --> 01:17:26,50
Unlocking it, he lifts the lid and gazes in. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS551
01:17:24,00 --> 01:17:33,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> pensively takes out his specialized ax and finds the silver along the blade untarnished. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS552
01:17:32,00 --> 01:17:39,50
Tipping it, he holds it firmly in both hands and regards it nostalgically. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS553
01:17:37,00 --> 01:17:43,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> slowly twirls the weapon in both hands. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS554
01:17:40,00 --> 01:17:47,50
Gaining confidence, he builds speed until the ax spins in a blur. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS555
01:17:49,00 --> 01:17:54,50
It slips from his grasp. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS556
01:17:51,00 --> 01:17:59,50
Bracing one hand on the chest, SOMEONE<Abraham> clenches a fist and softly pounds the chest lid. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS557
01:17:56,00 --> 01:18:01,50
In a battle tent. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS558
01:18:03,00 --> 01:18:09,50
Wearing his broad-brimmed hat, SOMEONE<Adam> leans forward, his hands on a table. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS559
01:18:14,00 --> 01:18:18,50
With SOMEONE<Speed> and SOMEONE<Will>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS560
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:29,50
In Gettysburg, SOMEONE<Adam> strides to the open flap of his tent where SOMEONE<Vadoma> stands post. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS562
01:18:45,00 --> 01:18:56,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> slides his pocket watch over a trajectory marked on a map. It becomes a locomotive speeding along a track in the darkness. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS563
01:18:54,00 --> 01:18:59,50
Sidling along the engine's outer railing. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS564
01:18:57,00 --> 01:19:02,50
SOMEONE<Speed> reaches the front and wipes off the headlamp. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS565
01:18:59,00 --> 01:19:06,50
He climbs back into the engine car where SOMEONE<Abraham> writes in his journal. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS566
01:19:03,00 --> 01:19:09,50
Pausing, the President looks up at his old friend. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS567
01:19:06,00 --> 01:19:15,50
Heading further into the car, a soot-smeared SOMEONE<Speed> catches SOMEONE<Abe> watching him and pauses with a frown. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS568
01:19:17,00 --> 01:19:22,50
He shifts his gaze. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS569
01:19:25,00 --> 01:19:35,50
SOMEONE<Speed> regards his old friend solemnly. A net of chains rattles over SOMEONE's<Abraham's> head as he returns the gaze with a faint smile. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS570
01:19:33,00 --> 01:19:50,50
Removing a pair of spectacles, the President takes up his ax and turns away. Now on a narrow path in the woods, SOMEONE<Adam>, SOMEONE<Vadoma> and a few underlings approach on horseback. Facing them, Ms. Tubman stays SOMEONE<Mary> who draws up her cloaks hood. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS571
01:19:54,00 --> 01:20:01,50
Riding ahead, SOMEONE<Vadoma> passes Ms. Tubman and looms over SOMEONE<Mary> on her horse. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS572
01:20:00,00 --> 01:20:06,50
She halts close to the First Lady who keeps her face hidden. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS573
01:20:04,00 --> 01:20:10,50
SOMEONE<Vadoma> draws a long, slim blade and points it at her head. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS575
01:20:10,00 --> 01:20:15,50
She pushes her hood back a few inches. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS576
01:20:18,00 --> 01:20:23,50
SOMEONE<Vadoma> reluctantly obeys. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS577
01:20:20,00 --> 01:20:27,50
SOMEONE<Mary> stares as the vampires ride off from whence they came. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS578
01:20:24,00 --> 01:20:33,50
Behind the First Lady, dozens of African-Americans emerge from hiding with sacks and baskets. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS579
01:20:31,00 --> 01:20:36,50
They join SOMEONE<Mary> on the path out of Washington. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS580
01:20:33,00 --> 01:20:39,50
Meanwhile, the locomotive races through the darkness. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS581
01:20:37,00 --> 01:20:43,50
Stepping into the car behind it, SOMEONE<Abraham> slides its door shut. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS582
01:20:41,00 --> 01:20:46,50
Stacks of crates fill both sides of the car. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS583
01:20:44,00 --> 01:20:51,50
Stepping past, SOMEONE<Abraham> pauses, raises his ax and turns. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS584
01:21:07,00 --> 01:21:15,50
From the engine, SOMEONE<Speed> leans out a window and spots several vampires leaping onto the freight cars. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS585
01:21:14,00 --> 01:21:22,50
He lunges back into the car with a smile. In a freight car, SOMEONE<Will> loads his six-shooter with silver rounds. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS586
01:21:22,00 --> 01:21:26,50
Pausing, he looks up. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS587
01:21:23,00 --> 01:21:29,50
SOMEONE<Will> frowns and gets to his feet, readying his gun. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS588
01:21:26,00 --> 01:21:34,50
A lantern swings from its post over his head as he steps over the wood plank floor. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS589
01:21:33,00 --> 01:21:37,50
Turning, he raises his weapon. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS590
01:21:37,00 --> 01:21:44,50
He moves to a shuttered hatch and slides it open, aiming into the darkness. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS591
01:21:44,00 --> 01:21:53,50
SOMEONE<Will> slides it shut then turns to face another shuttered hatch. He takes aim and reaches out to open it. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS592
01:21:50,00 --> 01:21:59,50
Hands burst through the baseboards and grab his ankles. SOMEONE<Will> falls back and the vampire starts to pull him out. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS593
01:21:57,00 --> 01:22:03,50
He fires a gun in each hand then scrambles free. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS595
01:22:09,00 --> 01:22:13,50
SOMEONE<Will> limps to a crate. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS596
01:22:12,00 --> 01:22:46,50
As he looks up, a vampire leaps from the shadows. Grabbing his guns, SOMEONE<Will> fires taking him down. He puts his back to the wall and aims in either direction. Arms burst through the wood and hug him from behind. The wounded vampire rises, but SOMEONE<Will> shoots him through the forehead. His guns fall from his grasp as he struggles against the vampire holding him. He fights his way free then grabs a huge pistol and blows the monster away. The kickback sends SOMEONE<Will> to the floor beside the dead vampire. He opens a door behind the monster letting him fall away. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS597
01:22:43,00 --> 01:22:52,50
As he slides it shut, countless more vampires leap onto the roof. SOMEONE<Will> hobbles to another car. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS599
01:22:59,00 --> 01:23:03,50
SOMEONE<Abe> goes. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS600
01:23:01,00 --> 01:23:06,50
Now between two rail cars. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS601
01:23:04,00 --> 01:23:10,50
SOMEONE<Abe> glances at the barrel of his ax. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS602
01:23:09,00 --> 01:23:40,50
SOMEONE<Will> gives him a bullet then shakes his hand. SOMEONE<Abraham> heads back inside as his friend climbs up to the rail car's roof. Inside, SOMEONE<Abe> stabs a vampire with a bayonet attached to the butt of his ax. He pulls the weapon out then ducks past another lapping off his head. On the roof, SOMEONE<Will> draws two pistols and shoots a vampire. In slow motion, the monster flies past him spraying blood. Another charges and SOMEONE<Will> fires. In slow motion, the shot rips through the vampire's shoulder. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS603
01:23:37,00 --> 01:23:47,50
Baring his fangs, he lunges at SOMEONE<Will>. SOMEONE<Will> flings him aside, but loses his balance nearly stepping over the roof's edge. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS604
01:23:45,00 --> 01:24:02,50
He regains his footing and hurries on to a vampire turning a hand wheel. Sparks fly from a wheel of the train. SOMEONE's<Will's> guns misfire. The vampire bares his hideous fangs. SOMEONE<Will> lunges pushing the ghoul to the next rail car ahead. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS605
01:23:59,00 --> 01:24:15,50
Rising to his knees, he turns the hand wheel, disengaging the brake. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Abraham> wedges his ax into a ceiling beam and dropkicks a vampire away. He goes to finish his enemy but finds only shards of wood on the floor. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS606
01:24:13,00 --> 01:24:35,50
The vampire jumps on his back. Forced toward an open door, SOMEONE<Abraham> braces himself with his ax. The vampire tries to bite his neck, but he flips his foe out of the rail car decapitating him as he shuts the door. The vampire's head lies at his feet. SOMEONE<Abraham> boots it out. On the roof, still turning the hand wheel, SOMEONE<Will> watches his enemy rise to his feet. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS607
01:24:33,00 --> 01:24:37,50
SOMEONE<Will> turns his head. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS608
01:24:36,00 --> 01:25:32,50
The vampire falls aside revealing SOMEONE<Abraham> standing halfway through a hatch, his modified ax in hand. SOMEONE<Will> spots a vampire climbing on to the roof. He grabs his partner's weapon and attacks the new arrival knocking the monster over the edge. He tosses the ax back to SOMEONE<Abe> who chops into another. With SOMEONE's<Abe's> blade stuck in his fallen foe, a vampire attacks with kicks and punches. As SOMEONE<Will> fends off the attacker, SOMEONE<Abe> lifts his ax, twirls it, releasing a spray of blood, then slashes off the vampire's head. In the same swing, he strikes another vampire's midsection. He massacres another, slashing his face several times, then passes the ax to SOMEONE<Will>. SOMEONE<Will> takes out two vampires then twirls the ax behind his back to SOMEONE<Abraham> who spins the versatile weapon and strikes another vampire with its butt. Through a veil of wind-swept steam, SOMEONE<Abraham> vanquishes yet another vampire. He brings his ax down once more. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS609
01:25:30,00 --> 01:25:49,50
The steam dissipates to reveal SOMEONE<Adam> clutching the ax handle. He kicks SOMEONE<Abraham>, sending the President back. SOMEONE<Abraham> lands between the railcars in a tangle of chains. SOMEONE<Adam> breaks the ax-handle over his knee. As SOMEONE<Abraham> climbs back onto the roof, SOMEONE<Will> hurls a knife. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS610
01:25:46,00 --> 01:25:57,50
The knife's tip nears SOMEONE's<Adam's> face, but the calm vampire tilts his head and dodges the blade. SOMEONE<Will> charges SOMEONE<Adam>, but gets knocked off his feet. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS611
01:25:54,00 --> 01:26:01,50
As he slides head first over the edge, SOMEONE<Abraham> grabs his ankle. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS612
01:25:58,00 --> 01:26:09,50
Revolvers fall from the dangling man's pockets. As the train speeds alongside a wall, SOMEONE<Will> nearly crashes into some jutting rocks. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS613
01:26:08,00 --> 01:26:12,50
SOMEONE<Adam> clutches SOMEONE's<Abraham's> collar. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS614
01:26:34,00 --> 01:26:41,50
SOMEONE<Adam> sinks his teeth into flesh, but finds himself biting SOMEONE's<Henry's> arm. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS615
01:26:38,00 --> 01:26:52,50
He kicks off the passing rock wall and lands facing his rival. As SOMEONE<Henry> ducks a punch, the pair gets jostled atop the last railcar. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Vadoma> exhales a puff of thick smoke. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS616
01:26:49,00 --> 01:26:55,50
With a match, she lights a rope sending flames up a beam. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS617
01:26:53,00 --> 01:27:15,50
As she marches off, a massive fire consumes the entire support structure of a bridge. SOMEONE<Adam> catches SOMEONE's<Henry's> arm then flips him. Grabs his leg and slams him through the roof. With an avalanche of broken wood, the vampires crash land on the floor of the railcar. SOMEONE<Adam> rises to his feet and slams SOMEONE's<Henry's> face through the top of a wooden crate. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS618
01:27:15,00 --> 01:27:23,50
SOMEONE<Adam> lifts the laughing vampire from the box then shoves him aside and peeks in the hole himself. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS619
01:27:21,00 --> 01:27:25,50
He pulls out a common rock. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS620
01:27:22,00 --> 01:27:28,50
Then looks up from the stone with a knowing gaze. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS621
01:27:25,00 --> 01:27:35,50
He tosses the rock and crosses to another crate. Inspecting the cargo, he finds more rocks in place of the silver. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS622
01:27:32,00 --> 01:27:40,50
SOMEONE<Adam> angrily paces away. He kicks open another crate, spilling rocks on the floor. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS623
01:27:46,00 --> 01:27:53,50
SOMEONE<Adam> boots SOMEONE<Henry> back into a corner. The evil vampire glares. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS624
01:27:51,00 --> 01:28:07,50
As the train nears the burning bridge, SOMEONE<Speed> eyes the blaze from the locomotive. He pulls back a lever, uses a piece of wood to keep it in place then leaves the controls. He enters the first railcar and staggers past the dummy cargo. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS625
01:28:06,00 --> 01:28:18,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Abraham> helps SOMEONE<Will> onto the roof. They rise to their feet and spot the burning bridge up ahead. They start for the locomotive but stop short. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS626
01:28:17,00 --> 01:28:21,50
They turn back. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS627
01:28:19,00 --> 01:28:25,50
They run back across the rooftops. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS628
01:28:22,00 --> 01:28:33,50
Making his way through the railcars, SOMEONE<Speed> finds a floor strewn with broken wood. He spots SOMEONE<Henry> unconscious on his back, then looks up through the open ceiling. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS629
01:28:31,00 --> 01:28:37,50
Turning around, he finds himself face to face with SOMEONE<Adam>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS630
01:28:43,00 --> 01:28:47,50
SOMEONE<Adam> grabs SOMEONE's<Speed's> throat. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS631
01:28:49,00 --> 01:28:55,50
SOMEONE<Abe> and SOMEONE<Will> arrive to see SOMEONE<Adam> bite into SOMEONE's<Speed's> neck. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS632
01:28:54,00 --> 01:29:18,50
The vampire looks up at them. Now, as the train passes over the burning bridge, the track splits and the last railcar breaks loose from the train. Left behind, the railcar teeters over a ledge sending SOMEONE<Abraham> and SOMEONE<Will> sliding down its roof. About to fall into the blaze below, they daringly leap across the divide and land on the next rail car's roof. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS633
01:29:15,00 --> 01:29:34,50
As what's left of the train races onward, the burning bridge collapses in its wake. Jostling inside a railcar, SOMEONE<Adam> braces himself and SOMEONE<Henry> rises to his knees. Their railcar breaks free from the train crashing into the support structure below the track. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS634
01:29:31,00 --> 01:29:41,50
SOMEONE<Adam> leaves the downed railcar. Emerging from thick smoke, he crosses the support structure and kicks out a beam.

01:29:38,00 --> 01:29:55,50
The track under the last railcar gives out and the railcar flips forward forcing SOMEONE<Abraham> and SOMEONE<Will> to run on to the next. SOMEONE<Adam> kicks out another support beam. SOMEONE<Abraham> and SOMEONE<Will> fall to the structure under the track then hurry along its beams. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS636
01:29:55,00 --> 01:29:59,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> looks back. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS637
01:29:59,00 --> 01:30:03,50
SOMEONE<Adam> marches towards them. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS638
01:30:04,00 --> 01:30:12,50
He vanishes. SOMEONE<Abraham> slings the silver pocket watch's chain around his fingers. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS639
01:30:10,00 --> 01:30:21,50
He drives his fist through the vampire's chest then pulls it out awash with blood. His mouth agape, SOMEONE<Adam> falls flat on his back. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS640
01:30:19,00 --> 01:31:04,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> and SOMEONE<Will> notice the track collapsing above them. Each clings to a pillar as the locomotive lands on the lower level. They jump into the open trailer of the locomotive's coal car. As the remaining bridge buckles, the locomotive struggles to climb the increasingly inclined track. SOMEONE<Abraham> peeks over the side glimpsing the burning structure underneath. He and SOMEONE<Will> make their way across the engine. The locomotive’s wheels spin kicking up sparks. Before the engine reaches the end, the bridge underneath it splits from the final portion of the track. SOMEONE<Abraham> and SOMEONE<Will> brace themselves, clinging to the engine. More sparks fly as the train begins to slide backward. Just before it slips off the edge, the locomotive starts to climb the angled track. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS643
01:31:28,00 --> 01:31:36,50
A massive black cloud of smoke rises from the abyss and blots out our view of the play. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS645
01:31:35,00 --> 01:31:42,50
Drawing back, we find SOMEONE<Henry> lying on the twisted end of the track. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS646
01:31:40,00 --> 01:31:44,50
SOMEONE<Abraham> hobbles over to him. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS647
01:31:42,00 --> 01:31:47,50
He reaches out and gives him a hand. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS648
01:31:45,00 --> 01:31:53,50
The President helps his mentor to his feet, then they both remain hunched over, catching their breath. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS649
01:32:13,00 --> 01:32:18,50
SOMEONE<Henry> and SOMEONE<Abraham> look at SOMEONE<Will>. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS650
01:32:21,00 --> 01:32:29,50
In the daytime, at a bustling military camp, SOMEONE<Mary> opens a box filled with silver blades. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS651
01:32:31,00 --> 01:32:36,50
She joins a few soldiers at another. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS654
01:32:37,00 --> 01:32:51,50
Our view raises from their tent, ascending a flagpole for a glimpse of the entire camp as runaway slaves arm the Union soldiers with the silver-outfitted weaponry. SOMEONE<Vadoma> walks through the camp. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS655
01:32:49,00 --> 01:32:56,50
Clutching her left arm and breathing heavily, she notices a crate of garlic. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS656
01:32:53,00 --> 01:33:00,50
Chatting with the commander, SOMEONE<Mary> spots SOMEONE<Vadoma> peeking around a tent. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS657
01:32:57,00 --> 01:33:03,50
She grabs a nearby rifle and heads after the vampire. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS658
01:33:02,00 --> 01:33:09,50
SOMEONE<Vadoma> comes out of hiding and faces her squarely standing about ten yards away. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS659
01:33:09,00 --> 01:33:16,50
SOMEONE<Mary> rips a silver chain with SOMEONE's<Willie's> miniature sword from her neck. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS661
01:33:14,00 --> 01:33:24,50
As the vampire charges, SOMEONE<Mary> drops the chain down the barrel of her gun. She takes aim at her fanged assailant. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS663
01:33:24,00 --> 01:33:36,50
She shoots SOMEONE<Vadoma> and the vampire lands on her back, the silver sword dangling from a hole in her head. Now, a soldier loads a silver ball into a cannon. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS664
01:33:35,00 --> 01:33:48,50
A Union infantry fires on a Confederate blitz, their bullets tearing through the vampires bodies. The infantry commander shout, "Charge!" and his men engage the enemy with silver bayonets. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS665
01:34:02,00 --> 01:34:18,50
Amid the chaos of battle, a soldier stabs the top of a vampire's head, then pulls his blade out and runs on. A line of cannons fire and a number of explosions erupt across the battlefield. One rips a vampire apart. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS680
01:37:15,00 --> 01:37:25,50
As the carriage fades away, the finished Washington monument appears in the distance. Marine One descends to the White House lawn. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS681
01:37:23,00 --> 01:37:32,50
Our view draws back from the screen of a smartphone as a live news report shows the helicopter touching down. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS682
01:37:30,00 --> 01:37:36,50
Sitting at a bar, a man thumbs a text message on the device. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS684
01:37:36,00 --> 01:37:41,50
He downs a shot then gestures to a bartender. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS685
01:37:42,00 --> 01:37:47,50
Beside him, SOMEONE<Henry> takes off a pair of dark sunglasses. 

ABRAHAM_LINCOLN_VAMPIRE_HUNTER_DVS687
01:37:52,00 --> 01:37:58,50
He slaps them on the back and a pistol falls on the floor.
