CHRONICLE_DVS20
00:02:45,00 --> 00:02:49,50
Later, they drive past a forest. 

CHRONICLE_DVS21
00:03:12,00 --> 00:03:17,50
The young man grins. 

CHRONICLE_DVS23
00:03:18,00 --> 00:03:23,50
They pull into a bustling high school parking lot. 

CHRONICLE_DVS24
00:03:23,00 --> 00:03:29,50
Now with the car parked, the camera stays on the driver. 

CHRONICLE_DVS25
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:39,50
Now in a hallway. 

CHRONICLE_DVS26
00:03:37,00 --> 00:03:42,50
Several students walk by. 

CHRONICLE_DVS27
00:03:39,00 --> 00:03:45,50
A jokester waves his arms in front of SOMEONE's<Andrew's> camera. 

CHRONICLE_DVS28
00:03:45,00 --> 00:03:51,50
Campaign posters show a smiling young man. A girl brings SOMEONE<Andrew> one. 

CHRONICLE_DVS30
00:03:56,00 --> 00:04:03,50
A cheerleading squad practices nearby waving green and white pom-poms. 

CHRONICLE_DVS31
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:05,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> sets up his camera on a bench behind him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS32
00:04:03,00 --> 00:04:08,50
Watching the girls, he grabs a bag of chips. 

CHRONICLE_DVS33
00:04:05,00 --> 00:04:12,50
Beyond him, a circle of field hockey players stretch out on the 50-yard line. 

CHRONICLE_DVS34
00:04:10,00 --> 00:04:16,50
The teenager glances back at his camera and eats another chip. 

CHRONICLE_DVS35
00:04:13,00 --> 00:04:20,50
Now, a dark-haired cheerleader marches over and faces him from a lower railing. 

CHRONICLE_DVS37
00:04:32,00 --> 00:04:37,50
A shaggy-haired guy grabs the camera. 

CHRONICLE_DVS38
00:04:35,00 --> 00:04:40,50
A dark-haired bully holds SOMEONE<Andrew> in a headlock. 

CHRONICLE_DVS39
00:04:40,00 --> 00:04:45,50
The bully smacks him in the face several times. 

CHRONICLE_DVS40
00:04:43,00 --> 00:04:49,50
The camera finds SOMEONE<Andrew> standing across the hall. 

CHRONICLE_DVS41
00:04:51,00 --> 00:04:56,50
The camera slides across the floor and tips on its side. 

CHRONICLE_DVS42
00:04:57,00 --> 00:05:02,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> picks up his camera then peers at its lens. 

CHRONICLE_DVS43
00:04:59,00 --> 00:05:06,50
In his friend's car again, he points his camera at the side mirror. 

CHRONICLE_DVS44
00:05:06,00 --> 00:05:11,50
The mirror shows him peering through the eyepiece. 

CHRONICLE_DVS45
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:14,50
He videotapes his friend. 

CHRONICLE_DVS46
00:05:48,00 --> 00:05:55,50
At a little corner park, three guys meet up toting bottles and brown bags. 

CHRONICLE_DVS47
00:05:59,00 --> 00:06:03,50
They notice SOMEONE<Andrew>. 

CHRONICLE_DVS48
00:06:06,00 --> 00:06:10,50
SOMEONE's<Andrew's> camera whirls. Later. 

CHRONICLE_DVS49
00:06:09,00 --> 00:06:15,50
A stationary view shows SOMEONE<Andrew> sitting at a desk in his bedroom. 

CHRONICLE_DVS50
00:06:12,00 --> 00:06:18,50
The pale teen connects a light attachment to his camera, 

CHRONICLE_DVS51
00:06:15,00 --> 00:06:20,50
switches it on, and smiles to himself. 

CHRONICLE_DVS52
00:06:21,00 --> 00:06:28,50
SOMEONE's<Andrew's> father barges in and the nervous teen quickly acts busy at his computer. 

CHRONICLE_DVS53
00:06:25,00 --> 00:06:32,50
He smacks SOMEONE<Andrew> upside the head, lifts him from his chair, and throws him down. 

CHRONICLE_DVS54
00:06:31,00 --> 00:06:36,50
He lowers his pointing finger. 

CHRONICLE_DVS55
00:06:34,00 --> 00:06:40,50
The bearded man storms out, leaving the bedroom door ajar. 

CHRONICLE_DVS56
00:06:40,00 --> 00:06:44,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> sits up. 

CHRONICLE_DVS57
00:06:43,00 --> 00:06:49,50
Bracing himself on the desk, he returns to his chair. 

CHRONICLE_DVS58
00:06:50,00 --> 00:06:59,50
He reaches to the camera, switches off the light attachment, then lowers his defeated gaze and licks his lips. 

CHRONICLE_DVS59
00:06:57,00 --> 00:07:02,50
He sits back a bit and expels a shaky breath. 

CHRONICLE_DVS60
00:07:03,00 --> 00:07:08,50
He reaches to shut off the camera. 

CHRONICLE_DVS61
00:07:05,00 --> 00:07:10,50
Later in his cousin's car. 

CHRONICLE_DVS62
00:07:10,00 --> 00:07:14,50
They approach a building. 

CHRONICLE_DVS63
00:07:12,00 --> 00:07:19,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> returns his camera to SOMEONE<Matt>, then videotapes several teens heading inside. 

CHRONICLE_DVS65
00:07:34,00 --> 00:07:47,50
Now, ravers wave glow sticks overhead as lasers beam across the dance floor. The camera catches a glimpse of a jumping girl's breasts, then returns to the chaos of the crowd. 

CHRONICLE_DVS66
00:07:44,00 --> 00:08:01,50
A DJ works a set of digital turntables. Across the dance floor, SOMEONE<Andrew> finds a blonde, young woman with a video camera of her own. Through her viewfinder, we glimpse partygoers at an upper railing, then spot SOMEONE<Andrew> with his shoulder-mounted camera. She waves to him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS67
00:07:59,00 --> 00:08:04,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> glances at his feet, then heads off through the crowd. 

CHRONICLE_DVS68
00:08:03,00 --> 00:08:07,50
She approaches him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS69
00:08:18,00 --> 00:08:22,50
SOMEONE<Matt> joins them. 

CHRONICLE_DVS70
00:08:38,00 --> 00:08:42,50
SOMEONE<Casey> records him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS71
00:08:47,00 --> 00:08:51,50
SOMEONE<Matt> shrugs. 

CHRONICLE_DVS72
00:08:49,00 --> 00:08:53,50
She heads off. 

CHRONICLE_DVS73
00:08:55,00 --> 00:09:11,50
SOMEONE<Matt> gives SOMEONE<Andrew> the finger. Later, surrounded by partygoers, an attractive, young woman dances on a table. Through his camera, SOMEONE<Andrew> looks the young woman up and down. A guy wearing a brimmed hat steps down to the floor and confronts the cameraman. 

CHRONICLE_DVS74
00:09:11,00 --> 00:09:15,50
He wipes his mouth. 

CHRONICLE_DVS75
00:09:24,00 --> 00:09:36,50
The guy splashes the camera with his drink, spits on SOMEONE<Andrew>, then walks away. Outside with a blurry lens, SOMEONE's<Andrew's> camera captures footage of a lawn near a line of parked cars. 

CHRONICLE_DVS76
00:09:34,00 --> 00:09:40,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> leans into view, then wipes the lens with his shirtsleeve. 

CHRONICLE_DVS77
00:09:47,00 --> 00:09:51,50
SOMEONE<Steve> shuffles over. 

CHRONICLE_DVS78
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:05,50
Crouching, SOMEONE<Steve> extends his hand. 

CHRONICLE_DVS79
00:10:22,00 --> 00:10:26,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> gets up and follows him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS80
00:10:36,00 --> 00:10:41,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> switches on the light. 

CHRONICLE_DVS81
00:10:45,00 --> 00:10:50,50
SOMEONE<Steve> leads him through the woods. 

CHRONICLE_DVS82
00:11:06,00 --> 00:11:12,50
They find SOMEONE<Matt> down a hill standing over a wide hole in the ground. 

CHRONICLE_DVS83
00:11:24,00 --> 00:11:31,50
SOMEONE<Steve> and SOMEONE<Matt> get down on the ground and peer down the deep hole. SOMEONE<Steve> grabs the cameraman. 

CHRONICLE_DVS84
00:11:35,00 --> 00:11:40,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> aims his camera down the hole. 

CHRONICLE_DVS85
00:11:41,00 --> 00:11:46,50
They all back away, but quickly return. 

CHRONICLE_DVS86
00:11:55,00 --> 00:12:00,50
SOMEONE<Steve> jumps on the hole and slides out of view. 

CHRONICLE_DVS87
00:11:59,00 --> 00:12:03,50
SOMEONE<Matt> steps down. 

CHRONICLE_DVS88
00:12:02,00 --> 00:12:07,50
Halfway in, SOMEONE<Matt> glances up. 

CHRONICLE_DVS89
00:12:09,00 --> 00:12:13,50
The young man slides out of view. 

CHRONICLE_DVS90
00:12:14,00 --> 00:12:18,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> follows. 

CHRONICLE_DVS91
00:12:23,00 --> 00:12:28,50
His camera's light shines dimly into a dark tunnel. 

CHRONICLE_DVS92
00:12:29,00 --> 00:12:34,50
His foot withdraws from a murky puddle. 

CHRONICLE_DVS93
00:12:35,00 --> 00:12:39,50
SOMEONE<Steve> jumps out in front of him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS94
00:12:59,00 --> 00:13:03,50
SOMEONE<Matt> slips. 

CHRONICLE_DVS95
00:13:05,00 --> 00:13:09,50
He follows SOMEONE<Steve> around a corner. 

CHRONICLE_DVS96
00:13:17,00 --> 00:13:24,50
As we enter a chamber with a giant glowing crystalline structure inside, the video image flickers. 

CHRONICLE_DVS97
00:13:37,00 --> 00:13:42,50
SOMEONE<Steve> and SOMEONE<Matt> step up to the sunburst-shaped structure. 

CHRONICLE_DVS98
00:13:41,00 --> 00:13:47,50
They lay their hands on the crystals which pulsate with light. 

CHRONICLE_DVS99
00:13:51,00 --> 00:13:57,50
SOMEONE<Steve> touches a crystal spike. Vine-like tendrils inside move. 

CHRONICLE_DVS100
00:13:57,00 --> 00:14:02,50
The crystal's glow changes to a shade of pink. 

CHRONICLE_DVS101
00:14:07,00 --> 00:14:14,50
SOMEONE<Steve> touches his face and finds blood streaming from his nose. He collapses. 

CHRONICLE_DVS102
00:14:13,00 --> 00:14:21,50
The camera's view jostles, showing the illuminated crystalline sunburst, then goes black. 

CHRONICLE_DVS103
00:14:19,00 --> 00:14:24,50
Light flashes in the darkness. 

CHRONICLE_DVS104
00:14:29,00 --> 00:14:33,50
We see a backyard. 

CHRONICLE_DVS105
00:14:39,00 --> 00:14:44,50
SOMEONE<Steve> holds a baseball in one hand. 

CHRONICLE_DVS106
00:14:42,00 --> 00:14:47,50
SOMEONE<Matt> steps into frame. 

CHRONICLE_DVS107
00:14:50,00 --> 00:14:56,50
SOMEONE<Steve> throws the baseball right into SOMEONE's<Matt's> face, then runs over to him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS108
00:15:13,00 --> 00:15:19,50
He overhands the ball into the lawn and it bounces into SOMEONE's<Steve's> face. 

CHRONICLE_DVS109
00:15:23,00 --> 00:15:29,50
SOMEONE<Matt> throws off to the side, but the ball curves around and hits SOMEONE<Steve> in the head. 

CHRONICLE_DVS110
00:15:32,00 --> 00:15:39,50
SOMEONE<Matt> throws. The ball slows down as it approaches SOMEONE<Andrew>. 

CHRONICLE_DVS111
00:15:39,00 --> 00:15:44,50
The ball hovers in front of SOMEONE<Andrew>. 

CHRONICLE_DVS112
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:49,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> points at the floating ball. 

CHRONICLE_DVS113
00:15:48,00 --> 00:15:53,50
The ball drops as it touches his nose. 

CHRONICLE_DVS114
00:15:52,00 --> 00:15:56,50
Later, in a bedroom. 

CHRONICLE_DVS115
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:07,50
Moving his hands, SOMEONE<Matt> levitates two Lego pieces which bounce off each other. 

CHRONICLE_DVS116
00:16:10,00 --> 00:16:17,50
SOMEONE<Steve> texts on his phone as SOMEONE<Matt> struggles to connect the floating Legos. 

CHRONICLE_DVS117
00:16:24,00 --> 00:16:33,50
As SOMEONE<Andrew> flicks his hands, several completed structures rise off the floor and connect to create the Seattle Space Needle. 

CHRONICLE_DVS118
00:16:36,00 --> 00:16:40,50
SOMEONE<Steve> gives him a high-five. 

CHRONICLE_DVS119
00:16:39,00 --> 00:16:45,50
SOMEONE<Matt> goes up for a high-five, but topples the Legos instead. 

CHRONICLE_DVS120
00:17:07,00 --> 00:17:11,50
Now, in SOMEONE's<Matt's> car. 

CHRONICLE_DVS121
00:17:20,00 --> 00:17:24,50
They walk through the woods. 

CHRONICLE_DVS122
00:17:29,00 --> 00:17:33,50
SOMEONE<Steve> jumps at him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS123
00:17:31,00 --> 00:17:36,50
They find the hole filled with soil. 

CHRONICLE_DVS124
00:18:04,00 --> 00:18:08,50
The park ranger watches from a hill. 

CHRONICLE_DVS126
00:19:12,00 --> 00:19:16,50
Now, in SOMEONE's<Andrew's> bedroom. 

CHRONICLE_DVS127
00:19:18,00 --> 00:19:26,50
Filming himself in the mirror, he lowers his arms from the camera and lets it hover in front of him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS128
00:19:23,00 --> 00:19:27,50
He backs away. 

CHRONICLE_DVS129
00:19:26,00 --> 00:19:31,50
Our view circles around the room. 

CHRONICLE_DVS130
00:19:36,00 --> 00:19:41,50
We find a proud grin on SOMEONE's<Andrew's> face. 

CHRONICLE_DVS132
00:19:45,00 --> 00:19:50,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> lies awake in bed. 

CHRONICLE_DVS133
00:19:53,00 --> 00:19:57,50
As he nods off, the camera falls. 

CHRONICLE_DVS134
00:19:55,00 --> 00:20:01,50
On another day, his mother holds it as they sit at a waterfront cafe. 

CHRONICLE_DVS135
00:20:04,00 --> 00:20:08,50
She films him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS136
00:20:07,00 --> 00:20:12,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> gives a worried look, then drops his gaze. 

CHRONICLE_DVS137
00:20:17,00 --> 00:20:24,50
He gives a bashful smile, then lifts his heavy-lidded eyes and stares directly at us. 

CHRONICLE_DVS138
00:20:24,00 --> 00:20:32,50
Now at a park, SOMEONE<Matt> telekinetically lifts a rock off the grass and skips it across the lake. 

CHRONICLE_DVS139
00:20:35,00 --> 00:20:40,50
Another plops right in the water. 

CHRONICLE_DVS140
00:20:41,00 --> 00:20:45,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> zooms in on him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS141
00:20:44,00 --> 00:20:49,50
SOMEONE<Matt> looks over, then gives a shrug. 

CHRONICLE_DVS143
00:21:50,00 --> 00:21:58,50
We pan over to three girls chatting by a leaf blower. It levitates and blows one girl's skirt up. 

CHRONICLE_DVS144
00:22:26,00 --> 00:22:31,50
Chips fly from a Pringles can into his mouth. 

CHRONICLE_DVS145
00:22:38,00 --> 00:22:44,50
Now, they drive through a shopping center's parking lot. 

CHRONICLE_DVS146
00:22:45,00 --> 00:22:49,50
In a store. 

CHRONICLE_DVS147
00:22:47,00 --> 00:22:54,50
The camera tapes SOMEONE<Andrew> pointing a toy light saber at woman's shopping cart. 

CHRONICLE_DVS148
00:22:52,00 --> 00:22:56,50
As she checks an item on a shelf. 

CHRONICLE_DVS149
00:22:53,00 --> 00:23:01,50
He directs her cart down another aisle and makes stuffed animals flip inside it. 

CHRONICLE_DVS150
00:22:58,00 --> 00:23:03,50
The woman chases after her runaway cart. 

CHRONICLE_DVS151
00:23:03,00 --> 00:23:10,50
In another aisle, a little girl takes a plush giraffe from a display cubby. 

CHRONICLE_DVS152
00:23:11,00 --> 00:23:16,50
A bear floats off a top shelf. 

CHRONICLE_DVS153
00:23:24,00 --> 00:23:33,50
As SOMEONE<Matt> stares at him, the guy's head suddenly snaps back. He flies forward, knocking a shelf over. 

CHRONICLE_DVS154
00:23:31,00 --> 00:23:35,50
SOMEONE<Matt> races away. 

CHRONICLE_DVS155
00:23:35,00 --> 00:23:39,50
At a diner. 

CHRONICLE_DVS156
00:23:47,00 --> 00:23:52,50
He stabs a fork at SOMEONE's<Matt's> hand. 

CHRONICLE_DVS157
00:23:52,00 --> 00:23:57,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> holds it up, showing its bent tines. 

CHRONICLE_DVS158
00:23:55,00 --> 00:23:59,50
SOMEONE<Matt> displays his unharmed hand. 

CHRONICLE_DVS159
00:24:03,00 --> 00:24:09,50
Our focus shifts at a window to a girl's tight dress. 

CHRONICLE_DVS161
00:24:23,00 --> 00:24:28,50
A woman gets out of the red car. 

CHRONICLE_DVS162
00:24:29,00 --> 00:24:36,50
Facing the parked car, SOMEONE<Steve> telekinetically drags it out of its spot. 

CHRONICLE_DVS163
00:24:36,00 --> 00:24:41,50
He turns it around to face a different space. 

CHRONICLE_DVS164
00:24:41,00 --> 00:24:45,50
He guides it in. 

CHRONICLE_DVS165
00:24:44,00 --> 00:24:50,50
SOMEONE<Steve> bounces excitedly, then pops his vest collar. 

CHRONICLE_DVS166
00:24:53,00 --> 00:24:57,50
His nose bleeds. 

CHRONICLE_DVS167
00:24:57,00 --> 00:25:02,50
He holds a bloody tissue out at SOMEONE<Matt>. 

CHRONICLE_DVS168
00:25:03,00 --> 00:25:09,50
The owner of the red car heads for her now vacant parking spot. 

CHRONICLE_DVS169
00:25:14,00 --> 00:25:19,50
The woman glances around. 

CHRONICLE_DVS170
00:25:24,00 --> 00:25:31,50
As the woman finds her car in its new space, SOMEONE<Steve> nudges his shoulder against SOMEONE's<Matt's>. 

CHRONICLE_DVS171
00:25:34,00 --> 00:25:39,50
Later, SOMEONE<Steve> pounds SOMEONE's<Matt's> dashboard. 

CHRONICLE_DVS172
00:25:56,00 --> 00:26:01,50
SOMEONE<Steve> films a tailgating truck. 

CHRONICLE_DVS173
00:26:09,00 --> 00:26:14,50
It suddenly veers through a guardrail. 

CHRONICLE_DVS174
00:26:18,00 --> 00:26:24,50
Now they find the truck nose down in a river. 

CHRONICLE_DVS175
00:26:28,00 --> 00:26:33,50
The truck starts to move. 

CHRONICLE_DVS176
00:26:36,00 --> 00:26:43,50
Shedding his jacket and shoes, SOMEONE<Steve> dives into the water. SOMEONE<Matt> moves to the riverbank. 

CHRONICLE_DVS177
00:26:45,00 --> 00:26:49,50
SOMEONE<Steve> swims to the trucks. 

CHRONICLE_DVS178
00:26:48,00 --> 00:26:54,50
He plunges below the water surface. 

CHRONICLE_DVS179
00:26:52,00 --> 00:26:56,50
SOMEONE<Matt> whips off his jacket. 

CHRONICLE_DVS180
00:26:57,00 --> 00:27:02,50
Rain pelts the water surface. 

CHRONICLE_DVS181
00:27:08,00 --> 00:27:13,50
SOMEONE<Steve> surfaces with the truck driver. 

CHRONICLE_DVS182
00:27:12,00 --> 00:27:19,50
SOMEONE<Matt> helps him drag the unconscious man onto the muddy riverbank. 

CHRONICLE_DVS183
00:27:18,00 --> 00:27:26,50
The driver lies limp with a long cut up his forearm and a streak of blood staining the corner of his mouth. 

CHRONICLE_DVS184
00:27:23,00 --> 00:27:31,50
Kneeling with his arms around the injured man, SOMEONE<Steve> lifts his gaze to SOMEONE's<Andrew's> viewfinder. 

CHRONICLE_DVS185
00:27:40,00 --> 00:27:45,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> grabs at SOMEONE's<Matt's> phone. 

CHRONICLE_DVS186
00:27:43,00 --> 00:27:47,50
Later, on the road. 

CHRONICLE_DVS187
00:27:47,00 --> 00:27:51,50
With the police. 

CHRONICLE_DVS188
00:27:49,00 --> 00:27:53,50
An officer points at us. 

CHRONICLE_DVS190
00:28:07,00 --> 00:28:11,50
SOMEONE<Steve> and SOMEONE<Matt> pace before SOMEONE<Andrew>. 

CHRONICLE_DVS191
00:28:29,00 --> 00:28:35,50
As SOMEONE<Matt> faces SOMEONE<Steve>, SOMEONE<Andrew> turns away. 

CHRONICLE_DVS192
00:28:33,00 --> 00:28:40,50
Now in his room, the troubled teen lies on his bed, one hand outstretched toward us. 

CHRONICLE_DVS193
00:28:37,00 --> 00:28:43,50
As we peer down at him through the airborne camera. 

CHRONICLE_DVS194
00:28:43,00 --> 00:28:49,50
He pensively floats the camera side to side, then above him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS195
00:28:49,00 --> 00:28:56,50
Our bird's eye of SOMEONE<Andrew> drifts higher. Now, in SOMEONE's<Matt's> car. 

CHRONICLE_DVS196
00:28:55,00 --> 00:29:02,50
The mind-controlled camera view shows SOMEONE<Andrew> seated close to us, looking in our direction. 

CHRONICLE_DVS197
00:28:59,00 --> 00:29:03,50
He faces SOMEONE<Matt>. 

CHRONICLE_DVS198
00:29:14,00 --> 00:29:19,50
The troubled teen gives a small solemn nod. 

CHRONICLE_DVS200
00:29:25,00 --> 00:29:29,50
They approach mounds of sawdust. 

CHRONICLE_DVS201
00:29:30,00 --> 00:29:34,50
SOMEONE<Matt> digs out a cellphone. 

CHRONICLE_DVS202
00:29:33,00 --> 00:29:37,50
He reads the display. 

CHRONICLE_DVS203
00:29:36,00 --> 00:29:40,50
SOMEONE<Steve> floats above them. 

CHRONICLE_DVS204
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:06,50
SOMEONE<Matt> leaps six feet up, then falls on his face. 

CHRONICLE_DVS205
00:30:11,00 --> 00:30:17,50
SOMEONE<Matt> does a high, rapid back flip, and slams to the ground. 

CHRONICLE_DVS206
00:30:21,00 --> 00:30:25,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> spreads his arms. 

CHRONICLE_DVS207
00:30:25,00 --> 00:30:31,50
Rocks and dirt float up around him as he rises. 

CHRONICLE_DVS208
00:30:36,00 --> 00:30:41,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> flexes and bends his legs as he rises. 

CHRONICLE_DVS209
00:30:45,00 --> 00:30:49,50
SOMEONE<Steve> takes his hand. 

CHRONICLE_DVS210
00:30:55,00 --> 00:30:59,50
Our view jostles. 

CHRONICLE_DVS211
00:31:00,00 --> 00:31:09,50
Now, we corkscrew past clouds. A teen in an orange hooded parka and gloves soars into view just beneath us. 

CHRONICLE_DVS213
00:31:12,00 --> 00:31:17,50
He grins at us and executes a roll. 

CHRONICLE_DVS214
00:31:15,00 --> 00:31:19,50
He accelerates. 

CHRONICLE_DVS215
00:31:16,00 --> 00:31:22,50
In his sporty black and white parka, SOMEONE<Steve> pulls ahead of us. 

CHRONICLE_DVS216
00:31:25,00 --> 00:31:31,50
They fly 10 thousand feet above populated terrain. 

CHRONICLE_DVS217
00:31:29,00 --> 00:31:35,50
We quickly come up on SOMEONE<Matt> who hovers as though standing. 

CHRONICLE_DVS218
00:31:32,00 --> 00:31:38,50
We pass him by, then he overtakes us again. 

CHRONICLE_DVS219
00:31:49,00 --> 00:31:56,50
Now, SOMEONE<Andrew> holds the camera out to record himself and SOMEONE<Matt> in action. 

CHRONICLE_DVS220
00:31:55,00 --> 00:32:04,50
Later, still in the sky, SOMEONE<Andrew> levitates a football. SOMEONE<Matt> kicks it to SOMEONE<Steve> who catches it 50 yards away. 

CHRONICLE_DVS221
00:32:04,00 --> 00:32:10,50
He hurls it back at astounding speed. SOMEONE<Matt> throws. 

CHRONICLE_DVS222
00:32:12,00 --> 00:32:17,50
SOMEONE<Matt> makes the two-handed catch above his shoulder. 

CHRONICLE_DVS223
00:32:25,00 --> 00:32:30,50
A passenger jet passes between the teens. 

CHRONICLE_DVS224
00:32:31,00 --> 00:32:42,50
The tumbling camera gives us a dizzying, rolling view of the ground, then the sky, the ground, the sky. As it steadies, we glimpse one of the boys plummeting. 

CHRONICLE_DVS226
00:32:41,00 --> 00:32:46,50
A second guy whisks him out of his free fall. 

CHRONICLE_DVS227
00:32:44,00 --> 00:32:51,50
As we near a cloud, SOMEONE<Andrew> emerges head-on toward us with SOMEONE<Steve> in one arm. 

CHRONICLE_DVS228
00:32:48,00 --> 00:32:53,50
With his free hand, he grabs the camera. 

CHRONICLE_DVS229
00:32:51,00 --> 00:33:01,50
Sharing his point-of-view, we peer out from the rippling folds of SOMEONE's<Andrew's> coat while making a controlled descent toward the landscape below. 

CHRONICLE_DVS230
00:32:58,00 --> 00:33:03,50
Our view rolls, landing in the grass. 

CHRONICLE_DVS231
00:33:00,00 --> 00:33:05,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> lies before us, nose bleeding. 

CHRONICLE_DVS232
00:33:02,00 --> 00:33:07,50
Behind him, SOMEONE<Steve> sits up. 

CHRONICLE_DVS233
00:33:13,00 --> 00:33:19,50
SOMEONE<Steve> helps SOMEONE<Andrew> up, hugs him, and spins him around. 

CHRONICLE_DVS234
00:33:17,00 --> 00:33:22,50
He falls with the shy teen then kisses him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS235
00:33:28,00 --> 00:33:34,50
SOMEONE<Matt> plunges down and lands in a roll. SOMEONE<Steve> grabs him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS236
00:33:40,00 --> 00:33:47,50
As SOMEONE<Steve> leads them toward the camera, SOMEONE<Matt> checks on SOMEONE<Andrew> who dabs his nose. 

CHRONICLE_DVS237
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:52,50
Later, SOMEONE<Matt> lies back. 

CHRONICLE_DVS238
00:33:56,00 --> 00:34:01,50
SOMEONE<Steve> drags SOMEONE<Matt> into the camera's view. 

CHRONICLE_DVS239
00:34:11,00 --> 00:34:17,50
Now in a boy's room, we view a vast collection of trophies. 

CHRONICLE_DVS240
00:34:14,00 --> 00:34:19,50
A certificate award bears SOMEONE's<Steve's> name. 

CHRONICLE_DVS241
00:34:44,00 --> 00:34:50,50
SOMEONE<Steve> and SOMEONE<Matt> grin at us through SOMEONE's<Andrew's> camera. 

CHRONICLE_DVS242
00:34:47,00 --> 00:34:53,50
Now in a dark living room, the shy teen lies back on a pillow. 

CHRONICLE_DVS243
00:34:51,00 --> 00:34:56,50
Peering up at us, he releases the camera into the air. 

CHRONICLE_DVS244
00:34:54,00 --> 00:35:00,50
As it floats upward, he folds his arms and watches it contentedly. 

CHRONICLE_DVS245
00:34:59,00 --> 00:35:05,50
At his head and feet, SOMEONE<Matt> and SOMEONE<Steve> each lie in separate makeshift beds. 

CHRONICLE_DVS246
00:35:40,00 --> 00:35:47,50
Seen through the hovering camera, the boys' heads form the three points of a triangle. 

CHRONICLE_DVS247
00:35:55,00 --> 00:36:01,50
Now in a library, the camera frames SOMEONE<Matt> and SOMEONE<Andrew>. 

CHRONICLE_DVS248
00:36:55,00 --> 00:37:02,50
Now from an angle over SOMEONE's<Casey's> shoulder, we see her open her front door. SOMEONE's<Matt's> on the porch. 

CHRONICLE_DVS249
00:37:05,00 --> 00:37:09,50
She jerks her thumb toward us. 

CHRONICLE_DVS250
00:37:17,00 --> 00:37:23,50
SOMEONE<Matt> removes his backpack and digs inside. 

CHRONICLE_DVS251
00:37:22,00 --> 00:37:26,50
He gives her an envelope. 

CHRONICLE_DVS252
00:37:44,00 --> 00:37:48,50
SOMEONE<Matt> checks his cellphone. 

CHRONICLE_DVS253
00:38:37,00 --> 00:38:41,50
SOMEONE<Matt> wearily creases his lips. 

CHRONICLE_DVS254
00:38:39,00 --> 00:38:42,50
SOMEONE<Casey> shrugs. 

CHRONICLE_DVS255
00:38:44,00 --> 00:38:49,50
She shuts the door on him and smiles. 

CHRONICLE_DVS256
00:38:46,00 --> 00:38:51,50
Now on a skyscraper's ledge. 

CHRONICLE_DVS257
00:38:51,00 --> 00:38:56,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> autopilots the camera. 

CHRONICLE_DVS258
00:39:09,00 --> 00:39:13,50
Each has a fast food drink. 

CHRONICLE_DVS259
00:39:13,00 --> 00:39:18,50
Later, still on the ledge. 

CHRONICLE_DVS260
00:40:01,00 --> 00:40:07,50
SOMEONE<Steve> looks into our hovering camera view. 

CHRONICLE_DVS261
00:40:09,00 --> 00:40:14,50
Now, SOMEONE<Andrew> models a suit and skinny tie. 

CHRONICLE_DVS262
00:40:28,00 --> 00:40:34,50
Later, we share the camera's perspective as SOMEONE<Andrew> carries it downstairs. 

CHRONICLE_DVS263
00:40:32,00 --> 00:40:38,50
We catch sight of his father who lounges in a recliner, watching TV. 

CHRONICLE_DVS264
00:40:36,00 --> 00:40:40,50
Slipping past him, we near the door. 

CHRONICLE_DVS265
00:40:41,00 --> 00:40:47,50
Facing the tired man, we spy empty beer bottles beside him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS266
00:41:02,00 --> 00:41:06,50
His dad sits up. 

CHRONICLE_DVS267
00:41:15,00 --> 00:41:20,50
The bearded man grins. 

CHRONICLE_DVS268
00:41:20,00 --> 00:41:24,50
Now, in a school auditorium. 

CHRONICLE_DVS269
00:41:24,00 --> 00:41:29,50
The blurry image sharpens. 

CHRONICLE_DVS270
00:41:29,00 --> 00:41:37,50
Now, before a packed student audience, a teen rock band backs up a blonde singer clad in black. 

CHRONICLE_DVS271
00:41:35,00 --> 00:41:41,50
Later, brightly clad girls execute synchronized dance moves. 

CHRONICLE_DVS272
00:41:39,00 --> 00:41:46,50
Later still, a teen soprano performs as her fellow students heckle her. 

CHRONICLE_DVS273
00:41:46,00 --> 00:41:52,50
Sharing another camera's perspective, we approach SOMEONE<Matt>. 

CHRONICLE_DVS274
00:41:51,00 --> 00:41:55,50
He turns and smiles. 

CHRONICLE_DVS275
00:42:07,00 --> 00:42:12,50
We view SOMEONE<Casey> through his camera. 

CHRONICLE_DVS276
00:42:16,00 --> 00:42:21,50
SOMEONE<Matt> re-trains his camera on the stage. 

CHRONICLE_DVS277
00:42:24,00 --> 00:42:28,50
SOMEONE<Steve> walks onstage. 

CHRONICLE_DVS278
00:42:51,00 --> 00:42:57,50
A spotlight hits a stage flat painted like a stone carving of a great cat. 

CHRONICLE_DVS279
00:42:56,00 --> 00:43:01,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> emerges from its roaring mouth. 

CHRONICLE_DVS280
00:43:05,00 --> 00:43:18,50
He gives a shy wave, then fumbles in his jacket pocket, produces a deck of playing cards, and faces SOMEONE<Steve>. As the shy teen fans the cards, the more popular boy sips an energy drink. 

CHRONICLE_DVS281
00:43:16,00 --> 00:43:21,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> starts to cross the stage with the cards. 

CHRONICLE_DVS282
00:43:18,00 --> 00:43:36,50
Then trips and falls. The cards go flying and land in a scattered heap. SOMEONE<Steve> makes exasperated gestures at SOMEONE<Andrew> who stands and worriedly eyes the cards. SOMEONE<Andrew> raises a finger then holds out his hand. The cards float up and collect in his palm. 

CHRONICLE_DVS283
00:43:40,00 --> 00:43:47,50
Later, he juggles four balls. He pauses, and they hover over his head. 

CHRONICLE_DVS284
00:43:45,00 --> 00:43:54,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> nonchalantly takes a sip of SOMEONE's<Steve's> energy drink. As his friend reaches for it, the balls drop on his head. 

CHRONICLE_DVS285
00:43:53,00 --> 00:43:57,50
Now, SOMEONE<Steve> checks a tightrope. 

CHRONICLE_DVS286
00:43:58,00 --> 00:44:06,50
Later, he stands by as SOMEONE<Andrew> edges uneasily down the tightrope with his arms spread for balance. 

CHRONICLE_DVS287
00:44:04,00 --> 00:44:08,50
The shy teen falters forward. 

CHRONICLE_DVS288
00:44:08,00 --> 00:44:13,50
He slowly straightens. 

CHRONICLE_DVS289
00:44:13,00 --> 00:44:17,50
He balances easily. 

CHRONICLE_DVS290
00:44:18,00 --> 00:44:24,50
With small heel-toe steps, he crosses the rope nimbly. 

CHRONICLE_DVS291
00:44:21,00 --> 00:44:27,50
Next, he hops from its end to a point three feet in. 

CHRONICLE_DVS292
00:44:27,00 --> 00:44:31,50
He does turns. 

CHRONICLE_DVS293
00:44:29,00 --> 00:44:35,50
Later, SOMEONE<Steve> tosses balls to SOMEONE<Andrew> who's still on the tightrope. 

CHRONICLE_DVS294
00:44:32,00 --> 00:44:41,50
SOMEONE<Steve> encourages applause. Juggling, SOMEONE<Andrew> lifts one leg behind him and catches a ball on his heel. 

CHRONICLE_DVS295
00:44:39,00 --> 00:44:45,50
The ball drops and rolls along the rope after him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS296
00:44:44,00 --> 00:44:51,50
Later, SOMEONE<Steve> presents SOMEONE<Andrew>, triumphant and beaming, to a standing ovation. 

CHRONICLE_DVS298
00:45:19,00 --> 00:45:24,50
Teens gather outside the mansion. 

CHRONICLE_DVS299
00:45:24,00 --> 00:45:31,50
The camera viewfinder now follows SOMEONE<Andrew>. As they near a pool, SOMEONE<Steve> approaches. 

CHRONICLE_DVS300
00:45:37,00 --> 00:45:44,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> grins from ear-to-ear as he's greeted with handshakes and pretty smiles. 

CHRONICLE_DVS301
00:45:44,00 --> 00:45:49,50
The camera view rose to a DJ. 

CHRONICLE_DVS302
00:45:46,00 --> 00:45:52,50
Indoors, it focuses on SOMEONE<Matt> on a couch. 

CHRONICLE_DVS303
00:45:53,00 --> 00:45:58,50
A girl with pink-dyed hair approaches. 

CHRONICLE_DVS304
00:46:04,00 --> 00:46:11,50
Our view drops onto a coffee table and records SOMEONE<Andrew> and SOMEONE<Monica> on a couch. 

CHRONICLE_DVS305
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:16,50
Kids play beer pong. 

CHRONICLE_DVS306
00:46:32,00 --> 00:46:37,50
Now, SOMEONE<Matt> picks up the camera. 

CHRONICLE_DVS307
00:46:34,00 --> 00:46:39,50
He films the beer pong match. 

CHRONICLE_DVS308
00:46:36,00 --> 00:46:41,50
A guy in a varsity jacket takes a drink. 

CHRONICLE_DVS309
00:46:39,00 --> 00:46:46,50
His opponent, SOMEONE<Andrew>, gets a high-five from SOMEONE<Steve> and a flirty squeeze from SOMEONE<Monica>. 

CHRONICLE_DVS310
00:46:43,00 --> 00:46:49,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> tosses two balls from one hand. 

CHRONICLE_DVS311
00:46:46,00 --> 00:46:50,50
Both go in. 

CHRONICLE_DVS312
00:46:47,00 --> 00:46:58,50
Next, he simultaneously tosses a ball from his left hand and his right. Travelling parallel, the balls bounce once and land in side-by-side cups. 

CHRONICLE_DVS313
00:46:56,00 --> 00:47:01,50
SOMEONE<Monica> gives SOMEONE<Andrew> a long, eager kiss. 

CHRONICLE_DVS314
00:46:58,00 --> 00:47:03,50
Later, SOMEONE<Steve> faces our view. 

CHRONICLE_DVS316
00:47:42,00 --> 00:47:49,50
Another camera view slyly records SOMEONE<Matt> talking into SOMEONE's<Andrew's> camera. 

CHRONICLE_DVS317
00:47:52,00 --> 00:47:56,50
SOMEONE<Casey> approaches. 

CHRONICLE_DVS318
00:48:39,00 --> 00:48:45,50
Now, SOMEONE<Steve> films himself on a stairway landing. 

CHRONICLE_DVS319
00:49:02,00 --> 00:49:08,50
SOMEONE<Monica> storms into view, her shoulder covered in vomit. 

CHRONICLE_DVS320
00:49:08,00 --> 00:49:12,50
SOMEONE<Steve> enters the bedroom. 

CHRONICLE_DVS321
00:49:15,00 --> 00:49:20,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> quickly pulls up his pants. 

CHRONICLE_DVS323
00:49:36,00 --> 00:49:44,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> lies belly-down on his bedroom floor, half-propped on his elbows with his hands folded. 

CHRONICLE_DVS324
00:49:41,00 --> 00:49:46,50
He watches a spider crossing in front of him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS325
00:49:44,00 --> 00:49:49,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> aims a hand at the creature and levitates it. 

CHRONICLE_DVS326
00:49:47,00 --> 00:49:55,50
As he holds it in suspension, the spider's legs all helplessly splay outward, pulled taut. 

CHRONICLE_DVS327
00:49:53,00 --> 00:49:57,50
The animal briefly struggles. 

CHRONICLE_DVS328
00:49:54,00 --> 00:49:59,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> spreads his fingers wide. 

CHRONICLE_DVS329
00:49:56,00 --> 00:50:01,50
Telekinetically tearing it apart. 

CHRONICLE_DVS330
00:49:59,00 --> 00:50:04,50
He holds the dismembered bits frozen in the air. 

CHRONICLE_DVS331
00:50:01,00 --> 00:50:07,50
Then, distracted, relaxes his hand. 

CHRONICLE_DVS332
00:50:04,00 --> 00:50:08,50
The parts drop. 

CHRONICLE_DVS333
00:50:06,00 --> 00:50:12,50
Now, a camera view from atop SOMEONE's<Andrew's> dresser records his bedroom. 

CHRONICLE_DVS334
00:50:10,00 --> 00:50:14,50
His father enters. 

CHRONICLE_DVS335
00:50:20,00 --> 00:50:25,50
The ragged man searches through SOMEONE's<Andrew's> belongings. 

CHRONICLE_DVS336
00:50:25,00 --> 00:50:33,50
He leaves a coat hanging on an armoire door and steps directly toward the camera. He reaches for it. 

CHRONICLE_DVS338
00:50:38,00 --> 00:50:45,50
They sit in a basement. SOMEONE<Andrew> slouches downcast as his father points fingers. 

CHRONICLE_DVS339
00:51:25,00 --> 00:51:33,50
His father overturns a table between them and slaps SOMEONE<Andrew> down. He pounces on the boy. 

CHRONICLE_DVS340
00:51:35,00 --> 00:51:42,50
He pulls the boy to his feet, but SOMEONE<Andrew> forces him up against the wall. 

CHRONICLE_DVS341
00:51:43,00 --> 00:51:48,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> throws his father several feet. 

CHRONICLE_DVS342
00:51:45,00 --> 00:51:55,50
The angry drunk crashes, tumbling across the dirty concrete floor. SOMEONE<Andrew> stands observantly by as the older man rolls on to his stomach. 

CHRONICLE_DVS343
00:51:52,00 --> 00:51:58,50
His feet upset some piled newspapers. 

CHRONICLE_DVS344
00:51:55,00 --> 00:52:03,50
As the retired firefighter catches his breath lying face down, SOMEONE<Andrew> remains standing. 

CHRONICLE_DVS345
00:52:00,00 --> 00:52:05,50
His shoulders heave as he catches his own breath. 

CHRONICLE_DVS346
00:52:03,00 --> 00:52:07,50
He stares off intensely. 

CHRONICLE_DVS347
00:52:08,00 --> 00:52:14,50
The view swings to SOMEONE<Matt> who dabs his bloody nose. 

CHRONICLE_DVS348
00:52:35,00 --> 00:52:43,50
He playfully reaches for her camera. Now among dark clouds at night, lightning flashes. 

CHRONICLE_DVS349
00:52:40,00 --> 00:52:45,50
The city gleams far below. 

CHRONICLE_DVS350
00:52:42,00 --> 00:52:46,50
SOMEONE<Steve> flies up. 

CHRONICLE_DVS351
00:53:40,00 --> 00:53:47,50
A zapping flash blots out everything. Our view tumbles. 

CHRONICLE_DVS352
00:53:44,00 --> 00:53:50,50
Daytime. Walking legs pass clad in black. 

CHRONICLE_DVS353
00:53:58,00 --> 00:54:06,50
A female cellist bows her instrument, performing on a lawn strewn with dead leaves. 

CHRONICLE_DVS354
00:54:10,00 --> 00:54:15,50
Mourners gather, many of them African-American. 

CHRONICLE_DVS355
00:54:13,00 --> 00:54:18,50
A dozen teens, each hold a white rose. 

CHRONICLE_DVS356
00:54:26,00 --> 00:54:32,50
The camera view rose to SOMEONE<Matt> who returns a stoic look. 

CHRONICLE_DVS357
00:54:29,00 --> 00:54:34,50
SOMEONE<Casey> clings to him, weeping. 

CHRONICLE_DVS358
00:54:31,00 --> 00:54:36,50
Afterward, SOMEONE<Andrew> films the gravesite. 

CHRONICLE_DVS359
00:55:19,00 --> 00:55:26,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> hovers the camera out of both their hands. SOMEONE<Matt> looks around. 

CHRONICLE_DVS360
00:55:28,00 --> 00:55:35,50
Our vantage rises like a helium balloon, but stays trained on the two young men. 

CHRONICLE_DVS361
00:55:46,00 --> 00:55:53,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> childishly turns his back on SOMEONE<Matt> and rockets skyward. 

CHRONICLE_DVS362
00:55:50,00 --> 00:55:56,50
At night, puddles retreat away from SOMEONE's<Andrew's> footsteps. 

CHRONICLE_DVS363
00:55:54,00 --> 00:56:02,50
By day, photos of SOMEONE<Steve>, small gifts, and wilting flowers rest on the new grave. 

CHRONICLE_DVS364
00:56:21,00 --> 00:56:27,50
Now, at his isolated lunch spot on the bleachers. 

CHRONICLE_DVS365
00:56:24,00 --> 00:56:30,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> sits motionless watching the cheerleaders practice. 

CHRONICLE_DVS366
00:56:29,00 --> 00:56:33,50
Later, in the school, between periods. 

CHRONICLE_DVS367
00:56:31,00 --> 00:56:36,50
His jostling camera view heads down some stairs. 

CHRONICLE_DVS368
00:56:34,00 --> 00:56:40,50
The pink-haired SOMEONE<Monica> notices him as she chats with friends. 

CHRONICLE_DVS369
00:56:37,00 --> 00:56:42,50
One girl pretends to retch. 

CHRONICLE_DVS370
00:56:41,00 --> 00:56:47,50
Further along, the bully makes a face at him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS371
00:56:48,00 --> 00:56:56,50
The bully bumps the lens with his elbow. Later, SOMEONE<Andrew> follows the unsuspecting thug down the hall. 

CHRONICLE_DVS372
00:56:54,00 --> 00:57:01,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> makes a pulling motion and the bully lurches, his mouth spurting blood. 

CHRONICLE_DVS373
00:56:58,00 --> 00:57:03,50
The camera resumes in a bathroom. 

CHRONICLE_DVS374
00:57:00,00 --> 00:57:05,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> holds up three bloody teeth. 

CHRONICLE_DVS375
00:57:23,00 --> 00:57:28,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> tosses the teeth into the toilet. 

CHRONICLE_DVS377
00:57:34,00 --> 00:57:38,50
In a junkyard. 

CHRONICLE_DVS378
00:58:01,00 --> 00:58:06,50
He sits cross-legged on an old icebox. 

CHRONICLE_DVS379
00:58:05,00 --> 00:58:09,50
He cracks his knuckles. 

CHRONICLE_DVS380
00:58:10,00 --> 00:58:18,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> straightens his back and holds out a hand. As he slowly makes a fist, a rusty car behind him implodes. 

CHRONICLE_DVS381
00:58:20,00 --> 00:58:25,50
Later in his bedroom, he sits at his computer. 

CHRONICLE_DVS382
00:58:24,00 --> 00:58:29,50
He gets up swiftly and puts on his coat. 

CHRONICLE_DVS383
00:58:31,00 --> 00:58:35,50
SOMEONE<Matt> arrives. 

CHRONICLE_DVS385
00:58:55,00 --> 00:59:00,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> shoves SOMEONE<Matt> who shoves back. 

CHRONICLE_DVS386
00:58:57,00 --> 00:59:06,50
SOMEONE<Matt> grabs SOMEONE<Andrew> by the lapel and throws a punch, but SOMEONE<Andrew> telekinetically arrests it inches from his face. 

CHRONICLE_DVS387
00:59:04,00 --> 00:59:13,50
The two stand in a stalemate, SOMEONE's<Matt's> fist trembling in suspension. He disgustedly lets go of his cousin and glares at him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS388
00:59:12,00 --> 00:59:17,50
SOMEONE<Matt> turns away and flies out the window. 

CHRONICLE_DVS389
00:59:14,00 --> 00:59:20,50
Left alone, SOMEONE<Andrew> grabs his backpack and heads out. 

CHRONICLE_DVS390
00:59:17,00 --> 00:59:23,50
From the hall, he views his agonizing mother lying in bed. 

CHRONICLE_DVS391
00:59:22,00 --> 00:59:30,50
As he swivels a hand aimed in her direction, her body gently turns and a blanket slides up to cover her. 

CHRONICLE_DVS392
00:59:34,00 --> 00:59:40,50
Now, a crooked view shows a pharmacist’s nametag. 

CHRONICLE_DVS393
00:59:58,00 --> 01:00:05,50
Back in his room, SOMEONE<Andrew> heaves a bulky red duffel bag onto his bed. 

CHRONICLE_DVS394
01:00:03,00 --> 01:00:10,50
He opens it up and lifts out a firefighter's helmet and eye guard. 

CHRONICLE_DVS395
01:00:07,00 --> 01:00:14,50
Next, he pulls out a pair of fireproof and waterproof suspender pants. 

CHRONICLE_DVS396
01:00:11,00 --> 01:00:15,50
He kicks off his sneakers. 

CHRONICLE_DVS397
01:00:16,00 --> 01:00:21,50
Wearing the pants, he puts on both rubber boots. 

CHRONICLE_DVS398
01:00:23,00 --> 01:00:28,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> fetches the rugged coat from the duffel. 

CHRONICLE_DVS399
01:00:26,00 --> 01:00:32,50
Its sleeves and body bear reflective yellow-green bands. 

CHRONICLE_DVS400
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:33,50
He puts it on. 

CHRONICLE_DVS401
01:00:31,00 --> 01:00:38,50
Now, he unzips the side panel on the bag and retrieves a full-face mask. 

CHRONICLE_DVS402
01:00:36,00 --> 01:00:40,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> sets it over his head. 

CHRONICLE_DVS403
01:00:38,00 --> 01:00:44,50
The breathing apparatus built into it covers his mouth and nose. 

CHRONICLE_DVS404
01:00:42,00 --> 01:00:48,50
Only his eyes show behind the curved window on the face shield. 

CHRONICLE_DVS405
01:00:45,00 --> 01:00:50,50
SOMEONE tweaks the straps, 

CHRONICLE_DVS406
01:00:47,00 --> 01:00:51,50
then adjusts the mask. 

CHRONICLE_DVS407
01:00:51,00 --> 01:00:56,50
Now, we approach the park thugs. 

CHRONICLE_DVS408
01:01:10,00 --> 01:01:15,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> aims a finger like a gun. 

CHRONICLE_DVS409
01:01:15,00 --> 01:01:20,50
He mimes shooting and the thug flies backward. 

CHRONICLE_DVS410
01:01:17,00 --> 01:01:27,50
As the others run, SOMEONE<Andrew> gestures sending one of them smashing into a car's rear window, and another cartwheeling down to the pavement. 

CHRONICLE_DVS411
01:01:25,00 --> 01:01:33,50
Launches himself high, he lands in front of the last remaining thug. The teen sends him flying back into the camera. 

CHRONICLE_DVS412
01:01:31,00 --> 01:01:38,50
As our view tilts downward and glides over the asphalt, we glimpse two of the unconscious thugs. 

CHRONICLE_DVS413
01:01:36,00 --> 01:01:43,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> telekinetically drags one side-to-side, leaving bloody smears on the pavement. 

CHRONICLE_DVS414
01:01:41,00 --> 01:01:46,50
We lift high overhead as he moves on to the other, 

CHRONICLE_DVS415
01:01:44,00 --> 01:01:49,50
takes out his wallet, and pilfers the cash inside. 

CHRONICLE_DVS416
01:01:46,00 --> 01:01:52,50
Returning to the first thug, he takes his money, too. 

CHRONICLE_DVS417
01:01:51,00 --> 01:01:57,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> launches himself into the air and grabs the camera. 

CHRONICLE_DVS418
01:01:57,00 --> 01:02:05,50
Now, he sits with his back to a fence and his respirator mask off, counting out the cash. 

CHRONICLE_DVS419
01:02:02,00 --> 01:02:10,50
He puts it in his backpack, heaves a deflated sigh, and shifts his thoughtful gaze. 

CHRONICLE_DVS420
01:02:07,00 --> 01:02:13,50
Grimly licking his lips. 

CHRONICLE_DVS421
01:02:15,00 --> 01:02:21,50
he zips up the backpack. 

CHRONICLE_DVS422
01:02:19,00 --> 01:02:25,50
Now wearing the mask again, he marches into a gas station's food mart. 

CHRONICLE_DVS423
01:02:22,00 --> 01:02:28,50
He punches the air, knocking the clerk back against the cigarette case. Surveillance footage shows SOMEONE<Andrew> taking off his backpack. 

CHRONICLE_DVS425
01:02:37,00 --> 01:02:43,50
From his camera, we watch him float cash from the register into his bag. The doors open behind him as he zips up his backpack and heads out. 

CHRONICLE_DVS426
01:02:40,00 --> 01:02:47,50
The security footage shows the clerk hopping over his counter with a shotgun. 

CHRONICLE_DVS427
01:02:44,00 --> 01:02:51,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> halts by the gas pumps and turns back to find him taking aim. 

CHRONICLE_DVS428
01:02:48,00 --> 01:02:53,50
The teen sweeps a hand sideways. 

CHRONICLE_DVS429
01:02:52,00 --> 01:03:01,50
Security footage shows the gun flying from the clerk's grasp and discharging into a propane tank. 

CHRONICLE_DVS430
01:02:58,00 --> 01:03:03,50
A huge explosion rocks the gas station. 

CHRONICLE_DVS431
01:03:01,00 --> 01:03:08,50
As the flames settle, we find both SOMEONE<Andrew> and the clerk lying on the ground in flames. 

CHRONICLE_DVS432
01:03:05,00 --> 01:03:13,50
Now, a hospital surveillance camera shows a policeman walking Mr. SOMEONE<Detmer> to a guarded room. 

CHRONICLE_DVS433
01:03:10,00 --> 01:03:16,50
Inside, a heavily bandaged SOMEONE<Andrew> lies unconscious. 

CHRONICLE_DVS434
01:03:25,00 --> 01:03:31,50
A surveillance camera shows the cop leaving the room. 

CHRONICLE_DVS435
01:03:28,00 --> 01:03:34,50
Another camera sits on a tripod near the foot of SOMEONE's<Andrew's> bed. 

CHRONICLE_DVS436
01:03:36,00 --> 01:03:44,50
Through the high-angle surveillance camera, we watch Mr. SOMEONE<Detmer> cross to a large window and remove his jacket. 

CHRONICLE_DVS437
01:03:42,00 --> 01:03:47,50
He takes a seat at his son's bedside. 

CHRONICLE_DVS438
01:03:44,00 --> 01:03:50,50
The tripod camera shows him taking SOMEONE's<Andrew's> hand. 

CHRONICLE_DVS439
01:03:47,00 --> 01:03:54,50
He bends over, resting his head on it, then lays a hand on his son's blanketed knee. 

CHRONICLE_DVS440
01:03:57,00 --> 01:04:03,50
The heavily bandaged teen lies motionless and unresponsive. 

CHRONICLE_DVS441
01:04:08,00 --> 01:04:14,50
Later, Mr. SOMEONE<Detmer> sits with a hunched posture, his hands in his lap. 

CHRONICLE_DVS442
01:04:16,00 --> 01:04:21,50
His brow furrowed, he hangs his head and swallows. 

CHRONICLE_DVS443
01:05:07,00 --> 01:05:11,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Detmer> stands. 

CHRONICLE_DVS444
01:05:16,00 --> 01:05:22,50
The surveillance camera shows him leaning over SOMEONE<Andrew> and jabbing a finger at him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS445
01:05:26,00 --> 01:05:30,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> grabs his wrist. An explosion blast out the windows. 

CHRONICLE_DVS446
01:05:28,00 --> 01:05:33,50
Now, a boy blows out candles on a birthday cake. 

CHRONICLE_DVS448
01:05:35,00 --> 01:05:40,50
SOMEONE's<Matt's> nose starts to bleed. 

CHRONICLE_DVS449
01:05:43,00 --> 01:05:48,50
We follow him as he hurries out of the room. 

CHRONICLE_DVS450
01:05:48,00 --> 01:05:53,50
He holds paper towels to his nosebleed. 

CHRONICLE_DVS451
01:05:58,00 --> 01:06:03,50
In the living room, everyone watches TV. 

CHRONICLE_DVS452
01:06:27,00 --> 01:06:32,50
We get in SOMEONE's<Casey's> car with SOMEONE<Matt>. Later. 

CHRONICLE_DVS453
01:06:42,00 --> 01:06:46,50
There's a roadblock up ahead. 

CHRONICLE_DVS454
01:06:44,00 --> 01:06:52,50
Now, as SOMEONE<Matt> drives amongst speeding emergency vehicles, a police car cuts him off. Later, they arrive near a crowd. 

CHRONICLE_DVS455
01:06:52,00 --> 01:07:00,50
Through SOMEONE's<Casey's> camera, we follow SOMEONE's<Matt's> gaze up the hospital building and find the smoking blast site. 

CHRONICLE_DVS456
01:07:05,00 --> 01:07:11,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> flies out from the smoke, holding his father by the ankle. 

CHRONICLE_DVS457
01:07:16,00 --> 01:07:20,50
He drops him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS458
01:07:17,00 --> 01:07:21,50
SOMEONE<Matt> suddenly takes flight. 

CHRONICLE_DVS459
01:07:21,00 --> 01:07:26,50
He catches Mr. SOMEONE<Detmer>. 

CHRONICLE_DVS460
01:07:23,00 --> 01:07:27,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> rescinds out of view. 

CHRONICLE_DVS461
01:07:25,00 --> 01:07:30,50
SOMEONE<Matt> carries his limp, soot-covered uncle to the ground. 

CHRONICLE_DVS462
01:07:32,00 --> 01:07:36,50
Later in the speeding car. 

CHRONICLE_DVS463
01:07:37,00 --> 01:07:43,50
A news helicopter descends rapidly, spinning out of control. 

CHRONICLE_DVS464
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:46,50
It crashes in front of them. 

CHRONICLE_DVS465
01:07:45,00 --> 01:07:50,50
SOMEONE<Matt> breaks to a stop. 

CHRONICLE_DVS466
01:07:48,00 --> 01:07:54,50
A cop suddenly gets flung away from their car. 

CHRONICLE_DVS467
01:07:53,00 --> 01:07:59,50
The car rises several stories high. 

CHRONICLE_DVS468
01:07:57,00 --> 01:08:01,50
We fly past skyscrapers. 

CHRONICLE_DVS469
01:08:12,00 --> 01:08:18,50
The car slams down on top of the Seattle Space Needle. 

CHRONICLE_DVS470
01:08:16,00 --> 01:08:22,50
We peer through the windshield as the car rocks precariously. 

CHRONICLE_DVS471
01:08:20,00 --> 01:08:25,50
The neon lights on the spire burst. 

CHRONICLE_DVS472
01:08:27,00 --> 01:08:35,50
Floating nearby, SOMEONE<Andrew> uses his power to blast out the windshield and suck SOMEONE<Matt> from the car. 

CHRONICLE_DVS473
01:08:34,00 --> 01:08:40,50
We tether backwards off the roof, then plummet. 

CHRONICLE_DVS474
01:08:39,00 --> 01:08:44,50
SOMEONE<Matt> flies down and pulls us out. 

CHRONICLE_DVS475
01:08:43,00 --> 01:08:50,50
We watch the falling car exploding on impact, then look up at our savior. 

CHRONICLE_DVS476
01:08:49,00 --> 01:08:55,50
He floats us safely to the street and sets us down. 

CHRONICLE_DVS477
01:08:56,00 --> 01:09:00,50
He flies back toward the needle. 

CHRONICLE_DVS478
01:09:05,00 --> 01:09:11,50
A Fox News graphic reads, "Downtown High Alert. " 

CHRONICLE_DVS479
01:09:10,00 --> 01:09:17,50
From the needle's observation deck, onlookers record the events on their cellphones. 

CHRONICLE_DVS480
01:09:15,00 --> 01:09:20,50
Floating just outside, SOMEONE<Andrew> glowers at them. 

CHRONICLE_DVS481
01:09:18,00 --> 01:09:24,50
SOMEONE<Matt> drifts up behind him, but his cousin hurls him back. 

CHRONICLE_DVS482
01:09:23,00 --> 01:09:31,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> shatters the windows of the observation deck and sucks up all of the bystanders' cellphones and cameras. 

CHRONICLE_DVS483
01:09:29,00 --> 01:09:37,50
They hover around him in the helicopter's spotlights as he spreads his arms and faces his cousin. 

CHRONICLE_DVS484
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:07,50
A police helicopter records them. 

CHRONICLE_DVS485
01:10:24,00 --> 01:10:28,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> grimaces. 

CHRONICLE_DVS486
01:10:38,00 --> 01:10:43,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> straightens and glares at his cousin. 

CHRONICLE_DVS487
01:10:43,00 --> 01:10:52,50
A bus hits SOMEONE<Matt> head on. The vehicle flies through the air and careens into a building's fifth story. 

CHRONICLE_DVS488
01:10:50,00 --> 01:10:55,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> lands clumsily on another building's rooftop. 

CHRONICLE_DVS489
01:10:52,00 --> 01:10:59,50
A few bystanders back away from the bandaged and bloody young man. 

CHRONICLE_DVS490
01:10:56,00 --> 01:11:01,50
He pukes as he stumbles to his feet. 

CHRONICLE_DVS491
01:10:59,00 --> 01:11:04,50
SOMEONE<Matt> flies in and swoops him off the roof. 

CHRONICLE_DVS492
01:11:01,00 --> 01:11:09,50
A bank's black and white security footage shows them smashing through a wall in its lobby. 

CHRONICLE_DVS493
01:11:06,00 --> 01:11:14,50
Now, from inside a speeding police cruiser, we watch the pair land in the street before us, 

CHRONICLE_DVS494
01:11:12,00 --> 01:11:16,50
creating an eight foot crater. 

CHRONICLE_DVS495
01:11:14,00 --> 01:11:21,50
SOMEONE<Matt> lifts his hand and the cruiser rises over the boys, landing on its roof. 

CHRONICLE_DVS496
01:11:19,00 --> 01:11:24,50
In an apartment overlooking the street. 

CHRONICLE_DVS497
01:11:27,00 --> 01:11:34,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> flies up through the apartment's floor and ceiling. SOMEONE<Matt> follows. 

CHRONICLE_DVS498
01:11:32,00 --> 01:11:40,50
From a few blocks away, we see dirt and SOMEONE<debris> billow up from a roof as the boys bust through. 

CHRONICLE_DVS499
01:11:37,00 --> 01:11:43,50
Now, SOMEONE<Andrew> flies backward above the street, throwing parked cars. 

CHRONICLE_DVS500
01:11:41,00 --> 01:11:51,50
As SOMEONE<Matt> dodges them, SOMEONE<Andrew> flies back into a lamppost. Sparks fly as he drops onto a parked car and rolls to the street. 

CHRONICLE_DVS501
01:11:48,00 --> 01:11:55,50
As SOMEONE<Matt> lands nearby, a helicopter searchlight shines down on him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS502
01:12:00,00 --> 01:12:06,50
He drags his unconscious cousin away from the car. 

CHRONICLE_DVS503
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:24,50
Two cruisers arrive. The cops take aim behind their open doors. SOMEONE<Matt> lifts his arms. 

CHRONICLE_DVS504
01:12:28,00 --> 01:12:32,50
The street lamp falls. 

CHRONICLE_DVS505
01:12:33,00 --> 01:12:38,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> wakes and tries to lift his head. 

CHRONICLE_DVS506
01:12:38,00 --> 01:12:46,50
As SOMEONE<Andrew> slowly gets to his hands and knees, bits of glass strewn around him rise off the pavement. 

CHRONICLE_DVS507
01:12:44,00 --> 01:12:51,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> stands up behind SOMEONE<Matt>, the glass shards hovering around him. 

CHRONICLE_DVS508
01:12:49,00 --> 01:12:55,50
An officer shoots. SOMEONE<Matt> flinches, then lowers his bloody right hand. 

CHRONICLE_DVS509
01:12:55,00 --> 01:13:05,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> waves his arms forward, sending the two cruisers flying back. SOMEONE<Andrew> flings the fallen streetlamp into a parked car. 

CHRONICLE_DVS510
01:13:02,00 --> 01:13:07,50
Both boys shoot straight up into the air. 

CHRONICLE_DVS511
01:13:05,00 --> 01:13:16,50
Now, as panicked bystanders flee, a camera tries to follow the movements of a body as it smashes through a billboard, then bounces between two buildings. 

CHRONICLE_DVS512
01:13:13,00 --> 01:13:20,50
The police chopper's camera shows the boys landing in a plaza near a statue. 

CHRONICLE_DVS513
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:25,50
Both lie face down on the stone tiles as several police cars surround the area. 

CHRONICLE_DVS514
01:13:22,00 --> 01:13:28,50
SWAT team members in black helmets train rifles on them. 

CHRONICLE_DVS515
01:13:26,00 --> 01:13:33,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> tries to crawl forward, the skin on his uncovered arm raw and bloody. 

CHRONICLE_DVS516
01:13:30,00 --> 01:13:36,50
A half-dozen laser dots cluster near his head and shoulder. 

CHRONICLE_DVS517
01:13:42,00 --> 01:13:47,50
SOMEONE's<Matt's> leg twitches and he lifts his head. 

CHRONICLE_DVS518
01:13:46,00 --> 01:14:01,50
As SOMEONE<Andrew> unsteadily gets to his feet, SOMEONE<Matt> stays low to the ground. SOMEONE<Andrew> wobbles around the plaza like an injured animal. With an arm shielding his eyes, he gazes skyward toward the chopper. Laser sight dots dance on his back. 

CHRONICLE_DVS519
01:14:07,00 --> 01:14:13,50
The teenager turns to face the semi-circle of police. 

CHRONICLE_DVS520
01:14:10,00 --> 01:14:16,50
Lunging forward, he sends a giant wave of energy toward them. 

CHRONICLE_DVS521
01:14:14,00 --> 01:14:20,50
The car skid backwards and the humans fly through the air. 

CHRONICLE_DVS522
01:14:17,00 --> 01:14:26,50
As SOMEONE<Matt> tries to prop himself up on his elbows, SOMEONE<Andrew> shakes both fists overhead in a primal scream. 

CHRONICLE_DVS523
01:14:23,00 --> 01:14:28,50
Windows shatter in the buildings around them. 

CHRONICLE_DVS524
01:14:28,00 --> 01:14:36,50
SOMEONE<Matt> looks on helplessly as huge glass shards rain down on frightened pedestrians. 

CHRONICLE_DVS525
01:14:41,00 --> 01:14:47,50
Blood trickling from his nose, SOMEONE<Matt> squints and looks around. 

CHRONICLE_DVS526
01:14:44,00 --> 01:14:52,50
His gaze lands on a nearby statue which depicts a shirtless warrior aiming a spear. 

CHRONICLE_DVS527
01:14:49,00 --> 01:14:56,50
With a quick wave of his hand, SOMEONE<Matt> sends the spear straight through SOMEONE's<Andrew's> back. 

CHRONICLE_DVS528
01:14:54,00 --> 01:15:00,50
Wearing an emotional SOMEONE<grimace>, SOMEONE<Matt> collapses. 

CHRONICLE_DVS529
01:14:57,00 --> 01:15:05,50
His impaled cousin hangs limp from the spear, now lodged in the ground at a 60-degree angle. 

CHRONICLE_DVS530
01:15:10,00 --> 01:15:22,50
From the helicopter's view, searchlights illuminate the two unmoving boys as the uniformed officers and SWAT members cautiously make their way to the center of the plaza. 

CHRONICLE_DVS531
01:15:19,00 --> 01:15:28,50
As the authorities move in, SOMEONE's<Matt's> eyes snap open. He jumps to his feet and shoots up into the air.
