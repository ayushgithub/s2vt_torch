CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS14
00:03:09,00 --> 00:03:13,50
He takes out a stack of cash. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS15
00:03:24,00 --> 00:03:29,50
SOMEONE<Jim> kisses the cash and tucks it away. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS16
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:38,50
SOMEONE<Jim> looks out the window. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS17
00:03:52,00 --> 00:03:57,50
Later, SOMEONE<Jim> shakes hands with the driver. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS18
00:03:55,00 --> 00:04:05,50
The car backs out of a driveway as SOMEONE<Jim> approaches a house. The front door opens and a doll faced brunette woman appears 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS19
00:04:03,00 --> 00:04:15,50
in the doorway. As SOMEONE<Jim> approaches, he hangs his head. The woman frowns. Reaching the front steps, SOMEONE<Jim> bobs his head soberly. As the woman lowers her gaze, he breaks into a smile. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS20
00:04:19,00 --> 00:04:24,50
She runs into his arms. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS21
00:04:34,00 --> 00:04:37,50
and holds a younger boy. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS22
00:04:40,00 --> 00:04:50,50
Later, the boxer sits on a patio in the night air. With an adoring smile, his wife brings two snifters of brandy and hands him one. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS23
00:04:55,00 --> 00:04:59,50
She sits. SOMEONE<Jim> puts down his glass

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS24
00:05:41,00 --> 00:05:46,50
SOMEONE<Jim> leans forward and pulls his wife closer. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS25
00:06:16,00 --> 00:06:23,50
She stands over him in her silky white midi blouse. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS26
00:06:48,00 --> 00:06:56,50
She raises his arms overhead. Letting them back down, she grabs him by the collar and kisses him. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS27
00:06:58,00 --> 00:07:04,50
Their lips still locked, SOMEONE<Jim> rises and holds her in his arms. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS28
00:07:02,00 --> 00:07:07,50
Towering over him, she smiles as they 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS29
00:07:06,00 --> 00:07:12,50
SOMEONE<Jim> looks around cautiously. Behind them, lights glow on string of colorful lanterns. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS30
00:07:16,00 --> 00:07:23,50
off into the darkness. Later, in a bedroom, SOMEONE<Jim> stands at a dresser. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS31
00:07:34,00 --> 00:07:41,50
The boxer takes off a Catholic cross necklace and drapes it over his framed wedding photo. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS32
00:07:39,00 --> 00:07:46,50
He removes a wristwatch, then drops a stack of cash across an open jewelry box. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS33
00:07:44,00 --> 00:07:54,50
A second wad plunks down in a money clip. On the lacquer dresser, another box sits filled with earrings, rings, and necklaces. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS34
00:07:53,00 --> 00:08:08,50
As our view moves across the flower print wallpaper, the picture goes dark. Now our view keeps moving to a white washed dresser top lined with a simple lace runner. Words appear, September 25th, 1933. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS35
00:08:06,00 --> 00:08:15,50
Four years into the Great Depression. A man's fingers reach for a folded straight razor near the Braddock's unframed wedding photo. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS36
00:08:13,00 --> 00:08:18,50
SOMEONE<Jim> squints at his reflection in a mirror. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS37
00:08:19,00 --> 00:08:24,50
He runs a hand down his cheeks. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS38
00:08:23,00 --> 00:08:37,50
He picks up a jagged hooked strip of metal with an ivory nub angled down from one end. Wincing, he fits it into his mouth. He checks his fake tooth in a mirror rubbing it with a forefinger. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS39
00:08:35,00 --> 00:08:43,50
Scratching his belly through his t-shirt, he steps around a wall of exposed lathe. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS40
00:08:43,00 --> 00:08:47,50
A girl sits up in bed. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS41
00:08:55,00 --> 00:09:01,50
His wife removes a pair of socks from an oven. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS42
00:09:00,00 --> 00:09:08,50
As she holds them out to the groggy boxer, he grabs her arm and pulls her in for a kiss. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS43
00:09:06,00 --> 00:09:10,50
holds the socks to his face. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS44
00:09:16,00 --> 00:09:22,50
She kisses her daughter's head as SOMEONE<Jim> puts on his shoes. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS45
00:09:23,00 --> 00:09:30,50
As he lifts SOMEONE<Rosie> onto his lap, his wife brings over a meat slice on a plate. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS46
00:09:30,00 --> 00:09:34,50
SOMEONE<She> kisses SOMEONE<her>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS47
00:09:32,00 --> 00:09:36,50
He sits her at the table, 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS48
00:09:37,00 --> 00:09:44,50
sets the plate in front of her. Outside before sunrise, SOMEONE<Jim> heads upstairs to an

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS49
00:09:42,00 --> 00:09:58,50
Two empty milk bottles sit in a basket. A notice around one reads, Past Due. SOMEONE<Jim> picks it up. Wearing suspenders over his t-shirt, he grabs the bottles. Now he returns to the basement apartment. As his wife looks over from the stove, he shows her the past 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS50
00:10:03,00 --> 00:10:08,50
SOMEONE<Jim> puts the empties on a shelf. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS51
00:10:07,00 --> 00:10:11,50
He adds the notice to a stack of bills. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS52
00:10:10,00 --> 00:10:15,50
His wife adds water to a milk bottle only one-eighth full. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS53
00:10:30,00 --> 00:10:35,50
She stabs it into the last morsel of 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS54
00:10:33,00 --> 00:10:38,50
The bottle's now three-quarters full. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS55
00:10:41,00 --> 00:10:47,50
As she pours a glass of milk, SOMEONE<Jim> returns to the table. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS56
00:11:19,00 --> 00:11:23,50
He gives his daughter his single piece of meat.  

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS57
00:11:21,00 --> 00:11:27,50
As SOMEONE eats with her hands, her father leans over the table and kiss his wife. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS58
00:11:26,00 --> 00:11:31,50
He grabs a coat and heads to the door.  

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS59
00:11:30,00 --> 00:11:33,50
His round faced wife watches him go. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS60
00:11:33,00 --> 00:11:45,50
In the early morning darkness, people stir in a parked car. As one of its doors opens, SOMEONE<Jim> crosses a dingy lot nearby where a crude tent sits near campfires. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS61
00:11:43,00 --> 00:11:47,50
Two children run out from the car. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS62
00:11:50,00 --> 00:11:58,50
Wearing a floppy cap, SOMEONE<Jim> warms his hands over one fire then stuffs them in his pockets and walks off. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS63
00:11:56,00 --> 00:12:00,50
Later, he heads down a sidewalk of darkness. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS64
00:12:56,00 --> 00:13:02,50
He meets SOMEONE's<Jim's> gaze. SOMEONE's<Jake's> finger points away from the boxer. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS65
00:13:08,00 --> 00:13:12,50
Glowering, SOMEONE<Jim> turns away. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS66
00:13:15,00 --> 00:13:20,50
Past a dirt smudged newspaper 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS67
00:13:18,00 --> 00:13:31,50
that reads, Unemployed hits record 15 million. Now, a boy jumps on a rusty box spring mattress left out on a staircase balcony. Twirling, he sees SOMEONE<Jim> arrive in the gravely courtyard below. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS68
00:13:38,00 --> 00:13:42,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> climbs out of a makeshift fort. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS69
00:13:41,00 --> 00:13:45,50
She runs over to SOMEONE<Jim>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS70
00:13:49,00 --> 00:14:00,50
In the basement apartment, SOMEONE's<Jim's> oldest son sits against a wall with his arms folded. SOMEONE<Jim> descends the stairs toward the open door holding SOMEONE<Rosie>. He faces SOMEONE<Mae>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS71
00:14:05,00 --> 00:14:09,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> nods. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS72
00:14:14,00 --> 00:14:20,50
Facing her husband, SOMEONE<Mae> shakes her head. SOMEONE<Jim> glowers. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS73
00:14:18,00 --> 00:14:23,50
Sulking, SOMEONE<Jay> stays still. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS74
00:14:24,00 --> 00:14:29,50
The boy gets up and grabs the salami off the 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS75
00:14:27,00 --> 00:14:32,50
SOMEONE<Jim> eyes his wife then follows SOMEONE<Jay> to the stairs. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS76
00:14:31,00 --> 00:14:36,50
The boxer musses his younger son's hair. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS77
00:14:34,00 --> 00:14:39,50
Now a woman exits the shop. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS78
00:14:37,00 --> 00:14:45,50
Plucked chickens hang in the window which frames a view of SOMEONE<Jay> handing the salami over a counter to a butcher. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS79
00:14:43,00 --> 00:14:53,50
SOMEONE<Jim> puts his arm around his son and brings the boy outside. A sign reads, Speagle's Meat and Poultry Shop. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS80
00:14:51,00 --> 00:14:57,50
Another sign mounted below the window displays the Coca Cola logo. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS81
00:14:55,00 --> 00:15:02,50
SOMEONE<Jim> and SOMEONE<Jay> follow the busy sidewalk. The straight haired boy looks up at his father. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS82
00:15:12,00 --> 00:15:19,50
Arms shaking, SOMEONE<Jim> glances down at him and swallows. The boxer looks around, shifting on his feet. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS83
00:15:25,00 --> 00:15:31,50
SOMEONE<Jim> leans down to his wide-eyed son, propping his hands on his knees. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS84
00:15:41,00 --> 00:15:46,50
SOMEONE<Jay> nods then gulps hard. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS85
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:51,50
Crouching below his son's eye level, SOMEONE<Jim> rubs his hands together. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS86
00:16:04,00 --> 00:16:08,50
SOMEONE<Jim> holds out his hand. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS87
00:16:08,00 --> 00:16:12,50
SOMEONE<Jay> hugs him. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS88
00:16:14,00 --> 00:16:19,50
He picks up his son. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS89
00:16:16,00 --> 00:16:23,50
SOMEONE<Jay> clings to his father who carries him down the sidewalk patting his back. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS90
00:16:32,00 --> 00:16:39,50
September 25th, 1933. In a locker room, SOMEONE<Joe> tapes up SOMEONE's<Jim's> left hand. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS91
00:16:54,00 --> 00:16:59,50
SOMEONE<Jim> shoots him a harsh look. It goes unnoticed by SOMEONE<Joe>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS92
00:17:05,00 --> 00:17:10,50
SOMEONE's<Jim's> face glistens with sweat. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS93
00:17:37,00 --> 00:17:42,50
He rubs SOMEONE's<Jim's> untaped right hand. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS94
00:17:43,00 --> 00:17:50,50
SOMEONE<Joe> feels around his fighter's wrist. SOMEONE<Jim> forces a wince into a smile. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS95
00:18:04,00 --> 00:18:08,50
With a solemn look, SOMEONE<Jim> shifts his draw. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS96
00:18:09,00 --> 00:18:14,50
SOMEONE<Joe> stops him then looks back down at his wrist. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS97
00:18:30,00 --> 00:18:34,50
SOMEONE punches the air 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS98
00:20:23,00 --> 00:20:28,50
then evades body blows by swiveling with 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS99
00:20:41,00 --> 00:20:45,50
head lulls forward, SOMEONE's 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS100
00:20:47,00 --> 00:20:52,50
shatter. As SOMEONE<Joe> looks away, SOMEONE's<Jim's>

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS102
00:23:49,00 --> 00:23:55,50
The husky fellow halts, inches in front of SOMEONE's<Jim's> manager. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS103
00:24:03,00 --> 00:24:09,50
The promoter turns away, leaving SOMEONE<Joe> under the stark overhead light. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS104
00:24:10,00 --> 00:24:18,50
SOMEONE<Joe> bites down on a cigar. Now, SOMEONE<Jim> exits into an alley, his right arm wrapped in a towel. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS105
00:24:16,00 --> 00:24:21,50
SOMEONE<Jim> jogs up to the promoter. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS106
00:24:19,00 --> 00:24:23,50
SOMEONE<Joe> follows. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS107
00:24:45,00 --> 00:24:50,50
SOMEONE<Johnston> nods with a meager smile. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS108
00:25:02,00 --> 00:25:06,50
SOMEONE<Johnston> gets into his car. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS109
00:25:15,00 --> 00:25:32,50
SOMEONE<Jim> watches the chauffeur driven car pull away. Shifting on his feet, he works his jaw then swaggers past SOMEONE<Joe>. The manager stays put, staring somberly after the promoter. Behind him, SOMEONE<Jim> sidles through a turnstile and gives it an angry shove as he clears through. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS110
00:25:31,00 --> 00:25:43,50
Now, in their drab basement apartment, SOMEONE<Mae> sits in an armchair sewing a shirt. She sits up and glances toward the door. SOMEONE<Jim> enters and sets down his bag. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS111
00:25:42,00 --> 00:25:49,50
to her feet and gazes attentively at her husband who approaches with a neutral expression on his face. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS112
00:25:51,00 --> 00:25:55,50
As SOMEONE takes her in his embrace, 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS114
00:26:16,00 --> 00:26:21,50
They separate and gaze into each other's eyes. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS115
00:26:23,00 --> 00:26:28,50
In bed, SOMEONE<Rosie> wakes up. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS116
00:26:30,00 --> 00:26:34,50
SOMEONE<Jim> shuts the door on a potbelly stove. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS117
00:27:21,00 --> 00:27:26,50
SOMEONE<Jim> gets out a leather-handled box. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS118
00:27:30,00 --> 00:27:39,50
SOMEONE<Jim> returns to his chair facing SOMEONE<Mae> and takes a rag from the box. Unseen, SOMEONE<Rosie> steps up to a curtain doorway

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS120
00:27:42,00 --> 00:27:47,50
His wife looks tenderly. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS121
00:27:44,00 --> 00:27:49,50
As she caresses the 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS122
00:27:47,00 --> 00:27:57,50
cast, he looks into her eyes. SOMEONE's<Jim's> chin trembles. He briefly bows his head, then forces words out. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS123
00:28:02,00 --> 00:28:06,50
She shakes her head. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS124
00:28:07,00 --> 00:28:19,50
As SOMEONE<Jim> bows his head again, SOMEONE<Mae> keeps her tear-moistened eyes on him. She leans close, nearly pressing her forehead to his, and drives her gaze squarely at him. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS125
00:28:19,00 --> 00:28:25,50
She cups his cheeks and kisses him. SOMEONE<Rosie> watches. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS126
00:28:24,00 --> 00:28:34,50
SOMEONE<Mae> sits on SOMEONE's<Jim's> lap. They share a deep kiss then warm smiles. SOMEONE<Jim> rests his head on her shoulder. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS127
00:28:32,00 --> 00:28:42,50
Closing his eyes, he wraps his arms around her. Daytime. Water droplets sag off the gate at the docks. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS128
00:28:42,00 --> 00:28:46,50
The eager men point. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS129
00:28:46,00 --> 00:28:52,50
SOMEONE<Jim> watches the foreman pace a few feet away. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS130
00:28:50,00 --> 00:28:54,50
The foreman steps closer. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS131
00:28:54,00 --> 00:29:03,50
view shows him choose another. He points again. The view focuses on SOMEONE<Jim>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS132
00:29:02,00 --> 00:29:06,50
SOMEONE<Jim> nods. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS135
00:29:34,00 --> 00:29:39,50
SOMEONE<Mike> and SOMEONE<Jim> start loading another dolly. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS136
00:29:46,00 --> 00:29:51,50
They move another sack. SOMEONE<Jim> doubles over briefly and flexes his fingers. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS137
00:30:02,00 --> 00:30:10,50
As SOMEONE<Jim> reaches for another sack, SOMEONE<Mike> joins him. The foreman notices SOMEONE's<Jim's> cast, painted to match his coat sleeve. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS138
00:30:11,00 --> 00:30:20,50
SOMEONE<Jim> looks from the supervisor to SOMEONE<Mike>. SOMEONE<Mike> straightens his cap under the foreman's stern gaze and hooks the next sack. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS139
00:30:26,00 --> 00:30:30,50
SOMEONE<Jim> and SOMEONE<Mike> resume hauling sacks onto the dolly. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS140
00:30:30,00 --> 00:30:34,50
SOMEONE<Jim> smiles. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS141
00:30:36,00 --> 00:30:40,50
Later, they enter a bar. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS142
00:30:46,00 --> 00:30:50,50
SOMEONE<Mike> eyes SOMEONE<Jim>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS143
00:30:53,00 --> 00:30:57,50
The two men find a table. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS144
00:31:55,00 --> 00:32:03,50
A title. December 1933. As a man shovels snow outside a dress shop, SOMEONE<Rosie> arrives. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS145
00:32:10,00 --> 00:32:17,50
Later, SOMEONE<Rosie> and SOMEONE<Mae> walk down the alley to the Tenement Courtyard and halt. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS146
00:32:17,00 --> 00:32:22,50
A man tinkers with an electric meter. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS147
00:32:45,00 --> 00:32:52,50
He adjusts the utility box. In the light snowfall, SOMEONE<Rosie> gazes up. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS148
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:57,50
Later, by candlelight, SOMEONE<Jim> stacks coins onto a two-dollar SOMEONE<bill>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS149
00:33:07,00 --> 00:33:12,50
SOMEONE serves dinner on a plate. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS150
00:33:16,00 --> 00:33:20,50
SOMEONE<Mae> joins him at the table. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS151
00:33:26,00 --> 00:33:31,50
SOMEONE<Mae> nods and fidgets with her wedding ring. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS152
00:33:39,00 --> 00:33:44,50
SOMEONE<Jim> chuckles and smiles. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS153
00:33:42,00 --> 00:33:48,50
SOMEONE holds out her hands, palms up, and SOMEONE takes them in his own 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS154
00:33:57,00 --> 00:34:03,50
and they both look toward the children's bed. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS155
00:34:05,00 --> 00:34:13,50
SOMEONE<Jim> frowns then SOMEONE<Mae> leads them in prayer. As she bows her head, SOMEONE<Jim> opens his eyes and shifts restlessly. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS156
00:34:20,00 --> 00:34:25,50
SOMEONE<Mae> lifts her gaze to his. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS157
00:34:25,00 --> 00:34:29,50
He lets go of her hands. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS158
00:34:31,00 --> 00:34:45,50
A billboard shows a rosy-cheeked lady smiling over her steering wheel next to a chipper dog. It reads, Buy at the Esso sign for happy motoring. In the snow beneath the sign, 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS159
00:34:43,00 --> 00:34:48,50
SOMEONE<Mae> and the children pull lattice boards off its base. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS160
00:34:46,00 --> 00:34:52,50
Nearby, a woman hurries after a man who marches away with luggage. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS161
00:35:09,00 --> 00:35:13,50
Later, SOMEONE<Mae> stokes their stove. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS162
00:35:12,00 --> 00:35:18,50
SOMEONE<Jay> reads to SOMEONE<Rosie>. SOMEONE<Howard> sleeps near the stove. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS163
00:35:19,00 --> 00:35:25,50
SOMEONE<Mae> takes a mug in hand and leans over SOMEONE<Howard>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS164
00:35:29,00 --> 00:35:36,50
weakly rolls his head to face her. A knit cap frames his flushed complexion. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS165
00:35:35,00 --> 00:35:40,50
She adjusts his blankets. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS166
00:35:39,00 --> 00:35:46,50
SOMEONE<Mae> stays at his side. Her lips crease into a deep frown. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS167
00:35:45,00 --> 00:35:51,50
As SOMEONE<Howard> trembles, SOMEONE<Mae> looks to her eldest son. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS168
00:35:59,00 --> 00:36:04,50
SOMEONE<Jay> and SOMEONE<Rosie> watch her exit quickly. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS169
00:36:06,00 --> 00:36:22,50
In her sweater and scarf, SOMEONE<Mae> crosses the snow to an alcove between buildings. Indoors, SOMEONE<Rosie> and SOMEONE<Jay> swap a look. Outside, SOMEONE<Mae> shifts on her feet, her face seizing with grief. Sheltered from the lightly falling snow, she turns toward the building. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS170
00:36:27,00 --> 00:36:32,50
She leans on the brick wall. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS171
00:36:34,00 --> 00:36:46,50
Later, inside, a coalscuttle sits empty next to the stove whose open grate reveals dying embers. SOMEONE<Mae> paces nearby, rubbing her hands together. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS173
00:36:58,00 --> 00:37:06,50
SOMEONE<Mae> remains by the wood stove. SOMEONE<Jim> marches deeper inside and finds the two beds empty. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS174
00:38:02,00 --> 00:38:08,50
SOMEONE<Jim> stands still before her. His green eyes lift. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS175
00:38:07,00 --> 00:38:11,50
SOMEONE<Mae> squares her chin and swallows hard. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS176
00:38:15,00 --> 00:38:19,50
SOMEONE<Jim> walks away. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS177
00:38:18,00 --> 00:38:22,50
He drops change on the table. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS178
00:38:23,00 --> 00:38:28,50
SOMEONE<Jim> shrugs then lowers his head and walks to the door. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS179
00:38:31,00 --> 00:38:35,50
SOMEONE<Mae> races after him. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS180
00:38:37,00 --> 00:38:47,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Jim> pulls his coat tight and walks off. With snow steadily falling, SOMEONE<Mae> stands alone in the white courtyard. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS181
00:38:46,00 --> 00:38:50,50
SOMEONE<Jim> heads down a street. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS182
00:38:48,00 --> 00:38:59,50
protruding from his cast. Later, indoors, a sign reads, Emergency relief administration of New Jersey. A man faces a clerk's grid wire window. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS183
00:39:11,00 --> 00:39:16,50
window, a chestnut haired clerk counts out 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS184
00:39:13,00 --> 00:39:22,50
a few five and two dollar bills for SOMEONE<Jim>. As she slides it into an envelope, the clerk looks into SOMEONE's<Jim's> eyes. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS185
00:39:25,00 --> 00:39:30,50
He shifts his eyes uneasily. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS187
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:51,50
He's on a boat, heading to New York City. A sign on its stern reads, Weehawken Ferry. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS188
00:39:50,00 --> 00:39:56,50
street, SOMEONE<Jim> passes two children collecting water from a hydrant. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS189
00:39:55,00 --> 00:40:03,50
Men and women in elegant attire carry wrapped presents as they cross from under an awning to a Rolls Royce. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS190
00:40:02,00 --> 00:40:08,50
The unemployed boxer makes his way past them, his gaze fixed. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS191
00:40:11,00 --> 00:40:19,50
SOMEONE<Jim> stops and stares across the street. His eyes scan the marquee for Madison Square Garden. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS192
00:40:19,00 --> 00:40:26,50
His hands slung in his pockets, he heads toward the entrance. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS193
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:39,50
inside, he lightly taps on a door and enters a boxing club. He nods to a man in a suit and walks into the smoky lounge. SOMEONE<Jim> passes businessmen at tables and makes his way to the front of the room by a bar. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS194
00:40:44,00 --> 00:40:52,50
Men in sofas and armchairs fix their attention on the decommissioned boxer. SOMEONE<Johnston> watches gravely. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS195
00:40:52,00 --> 00:40:59,50
More men face SOMEONE<Jim>. With his head lowered, he takes a deep breath. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS196
00:41:13,00 --> 00:41:18,50
SOMEONE<Jim> removes his cap and shrugs. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS197
00:41:21,00 --> 00:41:27,50
The humble father looks at the men then drops his gaze. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS198
00:41:38,00 --> 00:41:43,50
A man in a vest bows his head. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS199
00:41:48,00 --> 00:41:53,50
SOMEONE's<Johnston's> gaze sinks. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS200
00:41:56,00 --> 00:42:01,50
With tears in his eyes, SOMEONE<Jim> swallows. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS201
00:42:00,00 --> 00:42:09,50
Keeping still, the businessmen eye the man standing before them. A hefty patron looks around the room then gets up. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS202
00:42:10,00 --> 00:42:19,50
He reaches into his pocket and signals for SOMEONE<Jim> to step forward. The hefty man places a SOMEONE<bill> in SOMEONE's<Jim's> cap. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS203
00:42:22,00 --> 00:42:27,50
An older gentleman adds a few coins. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS204
00:42:27,00 --> 00:42:36,50
As another member contributes, SOMEONE's<Jim's> face brightens. He looks at two more gentlemen. They turn their heads and walk away. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS205
00:42:37,00 --> 00:42:57,50
Seated at a desk, SOMEONE<Joe> gazes off and rubs his lips. SOMEONE<Jim> steps toward a sofa in the club where SOMEONE<Johnston> stands up. The promoter reaches into his pocket then lets a handful of coins slide into the hat. Another gentleman drops in a few bills. As SOMEONE<Jim> lowers his gaze, a seated patron reaches out. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS206
00:42:58,00 --> 00:43:06,50
SOMEONE<Joe> looks on solemnly and presses his lips together. The decommissioned boxer meets his gaze. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS207
00:43:09,00 --> 00:43:19,50
SOMEONE<Jim> glances around the room then heads toward SOMEONE<Joe>. Passing framed pictures and a mirror, he reaches his old manager at the desk. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS208
00:43:17,00 --> 00:43:21,50
SOMEONE<Joe> rises from his chair. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS209
00:43:34,00 --> 00:43:39,50
SOMEONE's<Jim's> tear-filled eyes dart away from SOMEONE<Joe>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS210
00:43:43,00 --> 00:43:48,50
SOMEONE<Jim> picks through his cap and counts the donations. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS211
00:43:52,00 --> 00:43:57,50
He shakes his head. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS212
00:43:55,00 --> 00:44:00,50
SOMEONE<Joe> reaches into his pocket. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS213
00:43:59,00 --> 00:44:04,50
Now at the basement apartment, 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS214
00:44:11,00 --> 00:44:18,50
them, SOMEONE<Jim> sets down their luggage. In the bedroom, SOMEONE<Howard> jumps on a bed. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS215
00:44:26,00 --> 00:44:36,50
takes a seat at the kitchen table and watches his boys. He shifts his attention to SOMEONE<Rosie> playing with a doll. Springtime. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS216
00:44:34,00 --> 00:44:39,50
Bright sun, several families gather around a birthday cake. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS217
00:44:56,00 --> 00:45:01,50
a dozen children blow out the candles. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS218
00:45:12,00 --> 00:45:18,50
As the children devour cake slices, a priest approaches. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS219
00:45:39,00 --> 00:45:44,50
Across the street, a woman follows SOMEONE<Mike>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS220
00:46:25,00 --> 00:46:30,50
SOMEONE<Jim> stands slack jawed. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS221
00:46:29,00 --> 00:46:43,50
SOMEONE<Sarah> runs after her husband. Now in the Tenement Courtyard, a woman sweeps dust out of a garage set up as an apartment. While SOMEONE<Jay> bounces a ball off a wall, SOMEONE<Jim> crouches facing SOMEONE<Rosie>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS222
00:46:46,00 --> 00:46:54,50
slides her fist into his cheek. As SOMEONE<Joe> approaches, SOMEONE<Rosie> throws punches into her dad's hand. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS223
00:46:56,00 --> 00:47:00,50
SOMEONE's<Joe's> arrival distracts SOMEONE<Jim>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS224
00:47:00,00 --> 00:47:05,50
SOMEONE's<Rosie's> next punch hits SOMEONE's<Jim's> cheek. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS225
00:47:07,00 --> 00:47:12,50
kisses SOMEONE<Jim> then runs off. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS226
00:47:16,00 --> 00:47:19,50
They shake hands. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS227
00:47:24,00 --> 00:47:29,50
SOMEONE<Jim> studies SOMEONE's<Joe's> face. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS228
00:48:27,00 --> 00:48:32,50
As SOMEONE<Joe> stops, SOMEONE<Jim> shakes his head. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS229
00:48:58,00 --> 00:49:09,50
SOMEONE<Jim> hugs him. Nighttime. A sign reads, Primo Carnera versus Max Baer, World's Heavyweight Championship. Words appear. Madison Square. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS230
00:49:30,00 --> 00:49:36,50
SOMEONE<Jim> holds up a pair of bright red boxing shoes. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS231
00:49:59,00 --> 00:50:03,50
SOMEONE<Jim> looks up. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS232
00:50:52,00 --> 00:51:02,50
SOMEONE<Joe> walks out. With a bowl of hash sitting in front of him, SOMEONE<Jim> paces. He scans the locker room then leans over and eats out of the bowl. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS233
00:51:13,00 --> 00:51:20,50
As a balding man signals to SOMEONE<Jim>, the boxer looks back at his surprise visitor. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS234
00:51:21,00 --> 00:51:26,50
SOMEONE<Jim> wipes his face with a towel. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS235
00:51:52,00 --> 00:52:05,50
As the boxer walks out, the chuckling reporter puffs a cigarette. Now, SOMEONE<Jim> and SOMEONE<Joe> walk side by side down a hallway leading to the arena. Sporty enters the press box. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS238
00:52:54,00 --> 00:52:58,50
At SOMEONE's<Quincy's> bar, SOMEONE<Mike> approaches the radio. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS240
00:56:28,00 --> 00:56:32,50
A sign reads, Round 3. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS241
00:58:43,00 --> 00:58:50,50
In the locker room, SOMEONE<Jim> uses a spoon to finish the hash. SOMEONE<Joe> enters. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS242
00:59:35,00 --> 00:59:39,50
SOMEONE<Joe> softens his gaze. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS243
00:59:42,00 --> 00:59:46,50
The winner smiles and nods. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS244
00:59:47,00 --> 00:59:52,50
SOMEONE<Joe> opens the door to a crush of reporters. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS245
01:01:34,00 --> 01:01:44,50
Now in the basement apartment, a nightstand lamp shines next to the kids' bed. Lying on their backs, their eyes remain wide open. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS246
01:01:44,00 --> 01:01:48,50
They quickly lift their heads. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS247
01:01:47,00 --> 01:01:56,50
As they patter into the kitchen, SOMEONE<Jim> walks in. SOMEONE<Mae> emerges in her bib front apron and watches her husband shut the door behind him. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS248
01:01:56,00 --> 01:02:05,50
SOMEONE<Jim> sits wearily, his gaze turned downward. He reaches into his vest pocket, takes something out, and palms it. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS249
01:02:03,00 --> 01:02:11,50
SOMEONE<Jay> cranes to see. SOMEONE<Howard> and SOMEONE<Rosie> stare. SOMEONE<Mae> stands behind the children wringing

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS250
01:02:09,00 --> 01:02:13,50
A tentative smile settles on her 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS251
01:02:16,00 --> 01:02:22,50
SOMEONE<Jim> holds up some money. The children 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS252
01:02:37,00 --> 01:02:42,50
SOMEONE<Jim> meets her worried glance. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS253
01:02:43,00 --> 01:02:58,50
As SOMEONE<Mae> nods and smiles, SOMEONE<Jim> lifts his lips to hers. Pressing against him, SOMEONE<Mae> puts her free hand on his shoulder as she turns the meat. Daytime. At the docks, SOMEONE<Jim> flexes his right hand and glances at the padlocked gate. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS254
01:03:04,00 --> 01:03:08,50
SOMEONE<Jake> peers through the gate. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS255
01:03:09,00 --> 01:03:13,50
SOMEONE<Jim> smiles. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS256
01:03:11,00 --> 01:03:19,50
Later, a man hands SOMEONE<Jim> a pair of meat hooks. SOMEONE<Jim> heads toward the dock. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS257
01:03:17,00 --> 01:03:26,50
Motioning SOMEONE<Jim> aside, SOMEONE<Jake> shows him a sports page headline. Amazing! Braddock KOs SOMEONE<Griffin> in Three. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS258
01:03:26,00 --> 01:03:32,50
SOMEONE<Jim> regards the paper, nods and smiles. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS259
01:04:08,00 --> 01:04:12,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE load the bales onto 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS260
01:04:16,00 --> 01:04:21,50
Each bundle fills a worker's dolly. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS261
01:04:20,00 --> 01:04:25,50
As they hook another bale, SOMEONE<Jim> nods. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS262
01:04:31,00 --> 01:04:35,50
Now in SOMEONE's<Jim's> neighborhood. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS263
01:04:39,00 --> 01:04:47,50
In his parked car, SOMEONE<Joe> spots SOMEONE<Mae> and SOMEONE<Rosie> walking forward. SOMEONE<Mae> sees him drive off. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS264
01:04:48,00 --> 01:04:53,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> runs down the alley past SOMEONE<Jim>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS265
01:04:53,00 --> 01:05:02,50
SOMEONE<Jay> and SOMEONE<Howard> play in a decrepit car parked by the courtyard garages. SOMEONE<Rosie> and a friend go to her fort. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS266
01:05:22,00 --> 01:05:26,50
SOMEONE<Jim> shrugs. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS267
01:05:25,00 --> 01:05:32,50
Pacing with aimless steps, SOMEONE<Jim> smiles over a wad of bills. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS268
01:05:33,00 --> 01:05:38,50
SOMEONE's<Mae's> worried gaze shifts to the money. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS269
01:05:38,00 --> 01:05:43,50
SOMEONE<Jim> gives her the money. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS270
01:05:41,00 --> 01:05:48,50
He strokes her hair, steps back, and folds his arms with a smile. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS271
01:06:13,00 --> 01:06:18,50
SOMEONE<Jim> lifts SOMEONE<Mae> up. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS272
01:06:16,00 --> 01:06:21,50
he gazes up into her eyes. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS273
01:06:22,00 --> 01:06:34,50
Suspended off her feet, SOMEONE<Mae> blinks thoughtfully as she eyes him. SOMEONE<Jim> grins and kisses her. With their arms wrapped around each other, SOMEONE<Jim> gently sets her down. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS274
01:06:34,00 --> 01:06:41,50
SOMEONE<Mae> sadly lowers her gaze then lifts it. SOMEONE<Jim> strokes her chin. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS275
01:06:44,00 --> 01:06:49,50
He slings SOMEONE<Jay> over his shoulder. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS276
01:06:50,00 --> 01:07:20,50
Pouting slightly, SOMEONE<Mae> resolutely juts out her chin. Now, SOMEONE<Mae> marches across a busy street. The square roofed automobiles that pass have chromy grills and bug eyed headlights. SOMEONE<Mae> rounds a corner wearing a dressy russet blouse and a brown cloche hat. Behind her, two vendors sit at a folding table and men in business suits and fedoras follow different paths. SOMEONE<Mae> crosses a carpet to a residential building's posh entry. Inside, she faces an apartment door. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS277
01:07:22,00 --> 01:07:27,50
SOMEONE<Mae> lifts her knuckles to the wood again. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS278
01:07:27,00 --> 01:07:33,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Joe> walks to the door and checks the peephole. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS279
01:07:32,00 --> 01:07:35,50
SOMEONE<Mae> stays put. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS280
01:07:34,00 --> 01:07:40,50
As a woman inside approaches, SOMEONE<Joe> lifts a shushing finger. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS281
01:07:43,00 --> 01:07:48,50
The door remains shut. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS283
01:08:06,00 --> 01:08:15,50
SOMEONE<Mae> steps into an elegant and virtually empty room. Under a crystal chandelier, a card table and folding chairs sit on a parquet floor. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS284
01:08:13,00 --> 01:08:20,50
Later, SOMEONE<Joe> pours tea. The ladies each sit with a blossom patterned china cup. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS285
01:08:28,00 --> 01:08:33,50
SOMEONE<Joe> gives the door a dismissive wave. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS286
01:08:39,00 --> 01:08:44,50
He puts up his dukes. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS287
01:08:55,00 --> 01:09:01,50
Mrs. Gould bites her lip and shifts her gaze. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS288
01:09:08,00 --> 01:09:12,50
SOMEONE<Joe> shakes his head. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS289
01:09:35,00 --> 01:09:40,50
SOMEONE<Joe> gives his wife a dapper half smile. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS290
01:09:40,00 --> 01:09:49,50
As the women smile, SOMEONE<Joe> glances at each then leaves them. Mrs. Gould watches him disappear behind the doorway 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS291
01:09:47,00 --> 01:09:54,50
then lets her smile fade. Her gaze shifts uneasily and settles on Mrs. Braddock. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS292
01:10:04,00 --> 01:10:09,50
Sunlight silhouettes the two women. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS293
01:10:18,00 --> 01:10:23,50
Mrs. Gould looks away, smiles, and shakes her head. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS295
01:10:30,00 --> 01:10:36,50
Two classical columns support an empty mantle. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS296
01:10:38,00 --> 01:10:44,50
Now in the promoter's office, SOMEONE<Johnston> puffs a cigar. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS297
01:11:03,00 --> 01:11:07,50
SOMEONE<Joe> scoots his chair closer. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS298
01:11:55,00 --> 01:11:59,50
SOMEONE<Joe> leans back in his chair. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS299
01:11:59,00 --> 01:12:09,50
As SOMEONE<Johnston> draws on his cigar, the tips glows bright orange. He removes the stogie from his lips and glances about the dimly lighted room. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS300
01:12:07,00 --> 01:12:12,50
Sleeves rolled up, he cocks his head. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS301
01:12:13,00 --> 01:12:18,50
SOMEONE<Joe> dampens a brief smile. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS302
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:21,50
Later, Jeanette, SOMEONE's<Jim's> trainer, watches the bulldog. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS303
01:13:03,00 --> 01:13:08,50
SOMEONE<Joe> takes SOMEONE<Jim> to a corner. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS304
01:13:14,00 --> 01:13:18,50
SOMEONE<Jim> nods. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS305
01:13:16,00 --> 01:13:20,50
He meets SOMEONE's<Joe's> gaze. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS307
01:14:08,00 --> 01:14:18,50
At home, SOMEONE<Mae> packs SOMEONE's<Jim's> trunks into a brown paper bag as he straightens a tie tucked under his vest. She faces him sadly as he approaches. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS308
01:14:17,00 --> 01:14:21,50
SOMEONE<Mae> musters a smile. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS309
01:14:29,00 --> 01:14:34,50
SOMEONE<Jim> kisses SOMEONE<Mae> on the cheek. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS310
01:14:40,00 --> 01:14:45,50
Grinning, he backs out the door. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS311
01:14:44,00 --> 01:14:49,50
His wife's gaze sinks heavily to the floor. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS312
01:14:46,00 --> 01:14:59,50
Now in a ring, SOMEONE<Jim> faces an African-American boxer. As they advance on each other in slow motion. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS313
01:14:57,00 --> 01:15:01,50
Madison Square Garden. November 16. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS314
01:15:05,00 --> 01:15:10,50
blows, then SOMEONE<Jim> counters with a right hook. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS315
01:15:14,00 --> 01:15:20,50
Circling left, SOMEONE<Lewis> jabs at SOMEONE's<Jim's> head. SOMEONE<Jim> dodges. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS316
01:15:20,00 --> 01:15:24,50
SOMEONE<Jim> takes a barrage of hits. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS317
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:35,50
SOMEONE<Jim> moves in, slugging SOMEONE's<Lewis's> head. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS320
01:19:21,00 --> 01:19:25,50
The sports writers applaud. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS321
01:19:57,00 --> 01:20:02,50
SOMEONE's<Jim's> view blurs. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS322
01:20:25,00 --> 01:20:29,50
His opponent goes for his face 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS323
01:20:42,00 --> 01:21:11,50
Staggering, SOMEONE<Jim> remembers his children sleeping in one bed and eating in a soup kitchen. Quick flashes show SOMEONE<Mae> frowning and the past due notice on the milk bottle. SOMEONE<Jim> looks up at Lasky who appears to sink away. His mouthpiece tumbles across the canvas leaving a trail of spit. Fans rise from their seats. Remembering his children's bed lying empty, SOMEONE<Jim> looks up at his opponent's swollen face. The bulldog grins, blood trickling from his mouth as he crosses the ring. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS324
01:21:34,00 --> 01:21:38,50
his nimble footwork. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS326
01:21:50,00 --> 01:21:55,50
the crowd covers their mouth as SOMEONE<Jim> throws more punches. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS327
01:21:55,00 --> 01:21:58,50
Card reads, Round 13. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS328
01:22:24,00 --> 01:22:28,50
SOMEONE<Johnston> looks around. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS329
01:22:52,00 --> 01:22:58,50
The pudgy well-dressed passenger steps out into a hotel hallway. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS330
01:23:10,00 --> 01:23:20,50
As Baer glares back at his two scantily clad guests, the well-dressed man rolls his eyes. The bare chested champion faces Baer. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS331
01:23:30,00 --> 01:23:34,50
Baer shuts the door in his face. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS332
01:23:33,00 --> 01:23:43,50
Now at the relief office, SOMEONE<Jim> stands in one of the many long lines. A few people notice him and crowd close, whispering. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS333
01:23:47,00 --> 01:24:20,50
His face bruised and swollen, SOMEONE<Jim> eyes the gossipers. He gives them a shy wave. Later, at the chestnut haired clerk's window, he places a form on the counter then sets down a roll of cash bound in rubber bands. A note around the money lists the amount, $323. 60. SOMEONE<Jim> drops some coins on the form and slides it all to the clerk. Picking up the roll of bills, she eyes him strangely. He smiles. Now at home, SOMEONE<Jim> peers through the front door's window at SOMEONE<Mae>. He enters with a bouquet of roses. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS334
01:24:19,00 --> 01:24:26,50
He holds the flowers out over the kitchen table. SOMEONE<Mae> reads the attached note and smiles. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS335
01:24:25,00 --> 01:24:32,50
She runs her hand over her husband's. He removes his cap. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS336
01:24:36,00 --> 01:24:40,50
SOMEONE<Sarah> enters. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS337
01:24:42,00 --> 01:24:47,50
takes a seat. SOMEONE<Jim> stands hunched over the table. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS338
01:24:47,00 --> 01:24:52,50
Shadows mask SOMEONE's<Sarah's> troubled face. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS339
01:25:33,00 --> 01:25:39,50
Later in the dark, men flee past SOMEONE<Jim>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS340
01:25:39,00 --> 01:25:44,50
He moves through an array of crowded shacks. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS341
01:25:45,00 --> 01:25:51,50
Words appear. Hooverville. Central Park, New York City. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS342
01:25:50,00 --> 01:25:57,50
SOMEONE<Jim> eyes a poster of Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS343
01:25:56,00 --> 01:26:01,50
A man hurls a bottle. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS344
01:26:01,00 --> 01:26:06,50
A resident vomits. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS345
01:26:04,00 --> 01:26:11,50
SOMEONE<Jim> turns, looking all around. Three men eye him coldly. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS346
01:26:12,00 --> 01:26:17,50
SOMEONE<Jim> wanders between the shanties. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS347
01:26:19,00 --> 01:26:26,50
Seeing a group of cops beating a man with clubs, SOMEONE<Jim> hides back against a wall. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS348
01:26:35,00 --> 01:26:39,50
Policemen hold back a crowd. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS349
01:26:39,00 --> 01:26:45,50
Beyond an overturned wagon, men try to put out a fire. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS350
01:26:45,00 --> 01:26:51,50
SOMEONE<Jim> watches medics carry a body away on a stretcher. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS351
01:26:51,00 --> 01:26:56,50
A man lies on the ground, his chest heaving. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS353
01:26:59,00 --> 01:27:04,50
The boxer kneels to him. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS354
01:27:13,00 --> 01:27:22,50
Two ambulance workers fold SOMEONE's<Mike's> arms across his chest and hoist him onto a stretcher. Fire glows on SOMEONE's<Jim's> face

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS355
01:27:20,00 --> 01:27:25,50
as he watches them carry SOMEONE<Mike> away. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS356
01:27:28,00 --> 01:27:34,50
SOMEONE<Jim> stands in the open pit, wiping his hands. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS357
01:27:36,00 --> 01:27:41,50
SOMEONE<Mae>, SOMEONE<Rosie>, SOMEONE<Jay>, and SOMEONE<Howard> stand with other mourners. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS358
01:27:39,00 --> 01:27:53,50
Behind the priest, gravediggers idle near a truck filled with several more of the simple wood caskets. SOMEONE<Jim> and another worker climb out from the grave which is filled with a long row of coffins. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS359
01:27:51,00 --> 01:27:57,50
Wearing a black vest and tie, the boxer joins his family. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS360
01:27:57,00 --> 01:28:03,50
SOMEONE<Sarah> holds onto her black shawl as it billows in the wind. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS361
01:28:02,00 --> 01:28:06,50
SOMEONE<Mae> watches her sadly. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS362
01:28:11,00 --> 01:28:18,50
SOMEONE's<Jim's> wife looks down at SOMEONE's<Mike's> plain pine coffin. Now at a press conference, 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS363
01:28:22,00 --> 01:28:27,50
SOMEONE<Mae> and SOMEONE<Jim> strain to keep smiles on their faces. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS364
01:28:25,00 --> 01:28:29,50
SOMEONE<Joe> sits next to them. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS365
01:28:45,00 --> 01:28:51,50
The boxer leans into a row of radio station microphones. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS366
01:28:57,00 --> 01:29:01,50
His wife watches closely. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS367
01:29:19,00 --> 01:29:24,50
SOMEONE<Jim> leans closer to the bank of microphones. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS368
01:31:02,00 --> 01:31:06,50
SOMEONE<Mae> gapes. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS369
01:31:19,00 --> 01:31:26,50
Later, a woman shows SOMEONE<Joe> and SOMEONE<Jim> into an office. They wear their suits from the press conference. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS370
01:31:28,00 --> 01:31:33,50
SOMEONE<Johnston> picks up a newspaper. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS371
01:31:31,00 --> 01:31:36,50
He sets it down on the corner of his desk for SOMEONE<Joe>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS372
01:31:50,00 --> 01:31:54,50
He closes the window blinds. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS373
01:32:03,00 --> 01:32:09,50
Furrowing his brow, SOMEONE<Joe> trades look with his fighter. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS374
01:32:16,00 --> 01:32:22,50
Scowling, SOMEONE's<Jim's> manager watches Mills cross the room. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS375
01:32:26,00 --> 01:32:30,50
He closes the drapes. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS376
01:32:31,00 --> 01:32:40,50
SOMEONE<Johnston> starts a film projector. On a screen, black and white footage of a fight flickers in and out of focus. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS377
01:32:44,00 --> 01:32:49,50
He fights, hunched forward. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS378
01:32:48,00 --> 01:32:52,50
SOMEONE<Jim> looks over at SOMEONE<Johnston>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS379
01:32:55,00 --> 01:33:02,50
In the film, Baer hits Campbell repeatedly in the head, knocking him to a corner. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS380
01:33:01,00 --> 01:33:09,50
Light flickers on SOMEONE's<Jim's> sober face. Baer nails Campbell with series of hooks. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS381
01:33:11,00 --> 01:33:16,50
Baer knocks his opponent down. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS382
01:33:16,00 --> 01:33:25,50
The referee checks Campbell and waves frantically at the officials. The fighter's corner men rush to his side. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS383
01:33:25,00 --> 01:33:34,50
SOMEONE<Johnston> stops the projector. SOMEONE<Jim> keeps his eyes glued to the screen as the promoter rewinds the reel. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS384
01:33:37,00 --> 01:33:42,50
Campbell rises up from the canvas. SOMEONE<Jim> rises from his seat. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS386
01:33:47,00 --> 01:34:20,50
SOMEONE<Johnston> and SOMEONE<Joe> give him surprised looks. The promoter starts the projector again, playing the reel forward. As the two fighters square off, SOMEONE<Jim> steps closer, studying the footage intently. Baer hits Campbell repeatedly in the head, knocking him to a corner. SOMEONE<Jim> shifts his jaw as the giant slugger nails his opponent with a series of hooks. A quick color drained flash takes us into the fight. As Campbell leans over against the ropes, Baer winds up his right arm and knocks the fighter down with a haymaker. His body rolls back with a lifeless gaze. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS387
01:34:24,00 --> 01:34:50,50
The footage shows the referee checking the downed fighter and his corner men rushing in. As Baer towers over them, SOMEONE<Jim> swallows. Back in the ring, Baer adjusts his gloves as he looks at us. The projector's light flickers on SOMEONE's<Jim's> face. Now Baer approaches with a vacant trance-like stare. One side of SOMEONE's<Jim's> face twitches. The footage shows Baer's trainer throwing a towel over the slugger's shoulder. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS388
01:34:47,00 --> 01:34:52,50
The film stops. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS389
01:34:57,00 --> 01:35:01,50
He opens the drapes. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS390
01:35:07,00 --> 01:35:13,50
SOMEONE<Jim> looks at his manager who gives him a grim look. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS391
01:35:11,00 --> 01:35:15,50
Blinking, he faces SOMEONE<Johnston>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS392
01:35:21,00 --> 01:35:26,50
Squinting, SOMEONE<Jim> shifts on his feet. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS393
01:35:31,00 --> 01:35:36,50
a smile, SOMEONE<Joe> looks at SOMEONE<Johnston>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS394
01:35:37,00 --> 01:35:41,50
The promoter stands near a window. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS395
01:35:58,00 --> 01:36:05,50
Bathed in sunlight, SOMEONE<Johnston> looks down at his lawyer who nods. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS396
01:36:19,00 --> 01:36:25,50
Now, a waiter carries a covered silver tray into an elegant club. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS397
01:36:23,00 --> 01:36:28,50
formal wear dance at the center of the dining area. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS398
01:36:26,00 --> 01:36:31,50
follows Mrs. Gould to their table. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS399
01:37:02,00 --> 01:37:06,50
SOMEONE<Joe> holds a cigar as he reads. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS400
01:37:24,00 --> 01:37:29,50
A waiter starts to clear the table. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS401
01:37:43,00 --> 01:37:47,50
wraps the rest of her steak in her napkin. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS402
01:37:46,00 --> 01:37:52,50
Baer arrives and shakes hands with the SOMEONE<maitre>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS403
01:37:51,00 --> 01:37:59,50
The Cinderella Man follows his wife's gaze. As a waiter removes Baer's fur coat. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS404
01:37:58,00 --> 01:38:04,50
SOMEONE<Jim> turns in his seat, facing the large man fully. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS405
01:38:03,00 --> 01:38:10,50
winks as he crosses the room with a group of well-dressed friends. The Braddock’s and Gould’s watch 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS406
01:38:12,00 --> 01:38:16,50
SOMEONE<watch> cocks an eyebrow. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS407
01:38:19,00 --> 01:38:23,50
SOMEONE<Alfonse> brings a bottle of champagne. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS408
01:38:26,00 --> 01:38:32,50
waiter sets out glasses. SOMEONE<Joe> straightens his suit jacket. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS409
01:38:39,00 --> 01:38:49,50
As his fighter crosses the room, SOMEONE<Joe> gives SOMEONE<Mae> a reassuring gesture. At the bar, Baer stands and shakes SOMEONE's<Jim's> hand. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS410
01:39:18,00 --> 01:39:23,50
He cocks his head and nods. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS411
01:39:22,00 --> 01:39:28,50
As the photographers crowd before them, Baer poses. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS412
01:40:12,00 --> 01:40:18,50
She slams the glass down and stomps off. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS413
01:40:23,00 --> 01:40:30,50
Jaw tensed, SOMEONE<Jim> shifts on his feet. A smile crosses his face. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS414
01:40:37,00 --> 01:40:41,50
nears the exit. His smile fades. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS415
01:40:39,00 --> 01:40:45,50
Now in the apartment, SOMEONE<Mae> cleans a skillet. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS419
01:41:45,00 --> 01:41:52,50
Staring fearfully, the children nod. SOMEONE<Mae> yanks off her apron and marches out. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS420
01:41:51,00 --> 01:41:55,50
SOMEONE<Jim> leans to his children. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS422
01:42:02,00 --> 01:42:07,50
SOMEONE<Jim> closes the apartment door behind him. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS423
01:42:10,00 --> 01:42:15,50
Light shines down on the couple standing close together. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS424
01:43:39,00 --> 01:43:44,50
The overhead lamp highlights SOMEONE's<Mae's> pained face. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS425
01:43:51,00 --> 01:43:56,50
SOMEONE sits on the ring's edge with a towel draped over his neck. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS426
01:43:54,00 --> 01:44:00,50
At a railing above the ring, Jeanette frowns. SOMEONE<Joe> joins him. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS427
01:44:07,00 --> 01:44:11,50
A man whispers up to them. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS429
01:44:28,00 --> 01:44:32,50
appear. Day of the fight, June 1935. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS430
01:44:35,00 --> 01:44:40,50
SOMEONE packs a book-sized kit into a bag 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS431
01:44:43,00 --> 01:44:49,50
She meets his gaze. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS432
01:44:54,00 --> 01:45:04,50
Later, outside the rundown tenement, a man hurries to a railing overlooking the alley. SOMEONE<Jim> and his family walk to the curb. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS433
01:45:01,00 --> 01:45:05,50
As the fighter reaches for a car door stops. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS434
01:45:04,00 --> 01:45:11,50
Other families watch from the sidewalk. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS435
01:45:09,00 --> 01:45:13,50
Standing by the car's open door, SOMEONE<Jim> looks back at his wife. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS436
01:45:13,00 --> 01:45:17,50
hat cocked stylishly on her. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS437
01:45:15,00 --> 01:45:23,50
His shoulders shift beneath his crisp blue suit as he takes a few steps toward her and kisses her pale cheek. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS438
01:45:22,00 --> 01:45:30,50
As she closes her eyes, SOMEONE<Jim> regards his three children standing in a row. He smooths SOMEONE's hair and kisses her. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS439
01:45:30,00 --> 01:45:34,50
His daughter looks up at him seriously. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS440
01:45:34,00 --> 01:45:38,50
SOMEONE<Jim> kisses SOMEONE's<Howard's> forehead. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS441
01:45:37,00 --> 01:45:46,50
Stepping before SOMEONE<Jay>, SOMEONE<Jim> extends his hand. The young boy gives it a firm shake and his father proudly pats his cheek. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS442
01:45:45,00 --> 01:45:49,50
SOMEONE<Jim> extends his hand. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS443
01:45:48,00 --> 01:45:53,50
it, arching his brow and smiling. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS444
01:45:54,00 --> 01:45:59,50
His smile fades as he notices SOMEONE<Mae>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS445
01:45:57,00 --> 01:46:07,50
She presses her lips into a tight smile and nods slightly. SOMEONE's<Jim's> lip part and they share a long look between shallow breaths. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS446
01:46:04,00 --> 01:46:09,50
SOMEONE's<Jim's> jaw clenches shut. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS447
01:46:08,00 --> 01:46:12,50
SOMEONE<Mae> ushers her children away. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS448
01:46:19,00 --> 01:46:23,50
SOMEONE leans on the car's door as he 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS449
01:46:22,00 --> 01:46:28,50
Another family and four women huddled in a doorway. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS450
01:46:26,00 --> 01:46:38,50
Now, SOMEONE<Jim> jostles slightly in a taxi's back seat as it passes a sign advertising the fight. Arriving patrons wave to him. The men and women 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS451
01:46:36,00 --> 01:46:42,50
stadium, some dressed in suits, others in everyday clothes. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS452
01:46:48,00 --> 01:46:55,50
SOMEONE<Jim> waves back. Elsewhere, a woman opens a door for SOMEONE<Mae> and her children. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS453
01:47:05,00 --> 01:47:15,50
As SOMEONE<Mae> walks off, the children wander into their aunt’s house. SOMEONE<Howard> eyes a boxy wooden radio as an older man waves to SOMEONE<Rosie>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS454
01:47:15,00 --> 01:47:19,50
makes the sign of the cross and 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS455
01:47:19,00 --> 01:47:24,50
then steps beside their priest. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS456
01:47:30,00 --> 01:47:34,50
He nods then looks forward. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS457
01:47:36,00 --> 01:47:41,50
SOMEONE<Mae> turns her stunned gaze from the priest. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS458
01:47:39,00 --> 01:47:45,50
Our view follows to the many pews filled with working class families. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS459
01:47:49,00 --> 01:47:55,50
The priest smiles brightly. SOMEONE<Mae> stares thoughtfully. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS460
01:47:54,00 --> 01:47:59,50
An overhead view shows people crowding through the stadium entryway. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS461
01:47:58,00 --> 01:48:13,50
Madison Square Garden Bowl, Long Island City, New York. Our view lifts over the rim of the stadium to the rows of sparsely filled seats surrounding the brightly lit boxing ring. The New York skyline looms in the distance. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS462
01:48:13,00 --> 01:48:19,50
In the locker room, SOMEONE drops some cash on his bag.  He sets down his wedding ring by his pocket watch. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS464
01:48:22,00 --> 01:48:31,50
SOMEONE<Joe> lies on a bench nearby tapping his fingers on his chest and whistling at the ceiling. SOMEONE<Jim> slides down his suspenders. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS466
01:48:37,00 --> 01:48:42,50
He peels off his dress shirt and grabs a coat hanger. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS467
01:48:40,00 --> 01:48:46,50
SOMEONE briefly lifts his head off a bunch of towels serving as a pillow 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS468
01:48:44,00 --> 01:48:48,50
He again gazes at the ceiling. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS469
01:48:56,00 --> 01:49:00,50
SOMEONE saunters around the room 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS470
01:49:26,00 --> 01:49:30,50
finds a rolls of tape in SOMEONE's<Joe's> mouth. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS471
01:49:29,00 --> 01:49:33,50
As SOMEONE<Joe> stands, SOMEONE<Jim> bounces on his feet. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS472
01:49:31,00 --> 01:49:37,50
He sits on the empty bench and SOMEONE<Joe> feels his outstretched hand. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS473
01:49:41,00 --> 01:49:45,50
SOMEONE<Mae> rounds a corner. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS474
01:49:44,00 --> 01:49:48,50
Both men look up and stare. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS476
01:49:51,00 --> 01:49:55,50
As SOMEONE<Jim> goes to address his manager, halts his open mouth with his palm. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS477
01:49:57,00 --> 01:50:01,50
then walks out past SOMEONE<Mae>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS478
01:50:01,00 --> 01:50:06,50
They share a smile and SOMEONE<Joe> exits. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS479
01:50:07,00 --> 01:50:12,50
his feet, SOMEONE<Jim> leans on the wall. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS480
01:50:13,00 --> 01:50:17,50
SOMEONE<Jim> shrugs his brow. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS481
01:50:17,00 --> 01:50:27,50
She nods, smiling broadly. SOMEONE<Jim> crosses to her and she meets him halfway. She grips his shoulders and looks into his eyes. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS482
01:51:22,00 --> 01:51:27,50
Her strained grin fades to a misty 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS483
01:51:25,00 --> 01:51:29,50
as she pats his chest. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS485
01:51:44,00 --> 01:51:50,50
She gently strokes his face then pulls back with a weak smile. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS486
01:51:48,00 --> 01:51:54,50
As SOMEONE's<Jim's> gaze lowers, she turns around and walks out. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS487
01:51:54,00 --> 01:52:00,50
Now, filaments in a vacuum tube glow to life. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS488
01:52:00,00 --> 01:52:05,50
In the church, the Father tunes in a radio. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS489
01:52:14,00 --> 01:52:29,50
Reaching the aisle, SOMEONE<Jim> wears a silky blue robe, his name printed across the back arcs above a bulldog emblem. With SOMEONE<Joe> just behind him, the fighter passes two guards and looks around the packed arena. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS490
01:52:31,00 --> 01:52:38,50
Seated fans crane for a look. A man points. SOMEONE<Jim> takes a deep breath. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS491
01:52:38,00 --> 01:52:46,50
SOMEONE<Jim> eyes the staring crowd. With a nervous look, he glances back at SOMEONE<Joe> then starts toward the ring. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS492
01:52:56,00 --> 01:53:00,50
A few cameras flash. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS493
01:53:00,00 --> 01:53:27,50
Following his manager, SOMEONE<Jim> climbs the stairs to the ring. As SOMEONE<Joe> stretches the top rope high, he winks. Our view tilts and sidles under the rope into the ring where a referee and several gentlemen wait. A tall balding man removes his hat and SOMEONE<Jim> nods. As SOMEONE<Joe> faces the crowd, his wife grins in a bright red hat and waves. The manager smiles at her. SOMEONE<Jim> jogs in place. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS494
01:53:44,00 --> 01:53:51,50
Now inside her dark house, SOMEONE<Alice> heads down a hallway and opens a door. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS495
01:53:50,00 --> 01:53:57,50
Standing on the basement stairs with the radio, SOMEONE<Jay>, SOMEONE<Howard>, and SOMEONE<Rosie> look up innocently. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS497
01:54:12,00 --> 01:54:16,50
The defending champion lingers in the hallway. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS498
01:55:16,00 --> 01:55:22,50
Smiling, SOMEONE<Baer> looks at the packed stands. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS499
01:55:21,00 --> 01:55:31,50
SOMEONE<Baer> waves an arm over the rope. Now Mr. SOMEONE<Johnston> takes a seat. As the timekeeper raises a mallet, Sporty looks toward SOMEONE's<Jim's> corner. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS500
01:55:36,00 --> 01:55:43,50
As SOMEONE<Baer> glares fiercely at SOMEONE<Jim>, the timekeeper hits the bell. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS501
01:55:43,00 --> 01:55:52,50
The fighters move to the center and shuffle around each other. SOMEONE's<Baer's> face grows smug and he winks at SOMEONE<Jim>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS502
01:56:00,00 --> 01:56:05,50
He hits SOMEONE's chest. They clinch and punches SOMEONE<Baer> in the face.  

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS506
01:56:36,00 --> 01:56:39,50
The opponent rams his stomach. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS508
01:57:19,00 --> 01:57:24,50
A needle on a timer ticks around. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS509
01:57:47,00 --> 01:57:52,50
As SOMEONE jabs SOMEONE flat on the nose, 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS511
01:59:41,00 --> 01:59:46,50
SOMEONE<Jim> glares at his opponent. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS513
01:59:58,00 --> 02:00:04,50
As the boxers face off, SOMEONE<Baer> hits below the waist. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS514
02:00:18,00 --> 02:00:22,50
SOMEONE<Jim> rushes his opponent. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS515
02:00:27,00 --> 02:00:31,50
the champ's ribs. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS516
02:01:03,00 --> 02:01:09,50
SOMEONE's<Baer's> manager sponges water on him. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS517
02:01:15,00 --> 02:01:23,50
As SOMEONE<Baer> drinks, he sees men and women in the crowd eyeing him dubiously. The timekeeper slaps the mat. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS518
02:01:23,00 --> 02:01:36,50
SOMEONE<Baer> stands and glares, his brow hard set over a vengeful gaze. In the opposite corner, SOMEONE<Jim> rolls his neck. The champ eyeballs SOMEONE<Jim> with a vacant trance-like stare. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS519
02:02:07,00 --> 02:02:11,50
SOMEONE's<Jim's> right hook hits SOMEONE's<Baer's> chin. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS520
02:02:09,00 --> 02:02:13,50
SOMEONE<Baer> returns two jabs. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS521
02:02:12,00 --> 02:02:17,50
SOMEONE's<Jim's> view turns blurry. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS522
02:02:22,00 --> 02:02:28,50
SOMEONE<Jim> dodges three hooks. As they clinch. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS523
02:02:43,00 --> 02:02:51,50
SOMEONE's<Jim's> right hand winds up. SOMEONE's<Baer's> jaw takes the hit. His upper body torques. Sneering through blood, 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS524
02:03:35,00 --> 02:03:39,50
lets bloody water dribble out his mouth. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS525
02:03:39,00 --> 02:03:45,50
At Alice's, several ladies listen to the radio. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS526
02:03:44,00 --> 02:03:49,50
SOMEONE<Mae> arrives. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS527
02:03:48,00 --> 02:03:54,50
SOMEONE<Jay> looks to his sibling and SOMEONE<Rosie> frowns. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS528
02:03:52,00 --> 02:03:56,50
SOMEONE<Mae> approaches. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS529
02:03:57,00 --> 02:04:04,50
Reaching the basement doorway, she eyes her huddled children, then SOMEONE<Alice>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS530
02:04:10,00 --> 02:04:16,50
Her children peer earnestly up at her. SOMEONE<Mae> leaves the gathering. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS532
02:04:20,00 --> 02:04:31,50
Listening, SOMEONE<Mae> covers her mouth. At the fight, SOMEONE<Baer> pounds SOMEONE's<Jim's> side. SOMEONE<Mae> shuts her eyes and presses her knuckles to her lips. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS533
02:04:31,00 --> 02:04:36,50
SOMEONE<Baer> moves in, swinging wildly. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS534
02:04:46,00 --> 02:04:52,50
Dozens listen intently at the bar, at the church, and Aunt SOMEONE's<Alice's>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS535
02:04:57,00 --> 02:05:03,50
As SOMEONE<Mae> stands alone, SOMEONE<Joe> faces SOMEONE<Jim> in his corner. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS536
02:05:34,00 --> 02:05:39,50
assails SOMEONE with three jabs and a right hook then ducks 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS538
02:06:54,00 --> 02:06:58,50
At Alice's, SOMEONE<Mae> frowns sadly. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS539
02:06:58,00 --> 02:07:04,50
At the arena, a spectator shouts through his cupped hand. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS540
02:07:05,00 --> 02:07:10,50
Ref SOMEONE<McAvoy> circles past SOMEONE's<Jim's> corner. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS542
02:07:45,00 --> 02:07:52,50
The corner men insert each fighter's mouthpieces. SOMEONE<Baer> sways and huffs in his corner. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS543
02:07:53,00 --> 02:08:01,50
As SOMEONE<Jim> stands, he leans over with his mitts propped on his knees. He lifts his gaze to SOMEONE<Baer>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS544
02:08:06,00 --> 02:08:17,50
In a grainy blurred focused view from SOMEONE's<Jim's> corner, SOMEONE<Baer> rubs his head and shakes his arms down. SOMEONE<Jim> loosens his ankles with a little footwork. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS545
02:08:20,00 --> 02:08:26,50
Ringside, the timekeeper raises his mallet. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS546
02:08:24,00 --> 02:08:34,50
The fighters move to the center of the ring. SOMEONE<Baer> seethes his head and shoulders hunched forward. SOMEONE's<Jim's> thoughtful gaze

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS547
02:08:44,00 --> 02:08:48,50
mitts come together. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS549
02:09:13,00 --> 02:09:18,50
SOMEONE<Jim> lands a right hook right and wallops him. SOMEONE<Jim> punches SOMEONE's<Baer's> face. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS550
02:09:22,00 --> 02:09:27,50
Now SOMEONE<Baer> pounds at SOMEONE's<Jim's> rib cage. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS552
02:09:45,00 --> 02:09:49,50
SOMEONE<Mae> joins the others near the radio. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS553
02:10:04,00 --> 02:10:09,50
SOMEONE<Jim> delivers a left jab. As SOMEONE<Baer> swings

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS554
02:10:11,00 --> 02:10:15,50
and slugs him hard. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS555
02:10:16,00 --> 02:10:27,50
As SOMEONE<Mae> gapes, SOMEONE<Jim> staggers into the ropes. SOMEONE<Joe> and Mrs. Gould stare fretfully. Dozens of spectators stand, craning for a look. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS556
02:10:26,00 --> 02:10:44,50
At Alice's, SOMEONE<Jay> looks to his mother. At SOMEONE's<Quincy's> Bar, SOMEONE<Jake> hangs his head. In the ring, SOMEONE<Jim> hunches forward. With a sidelong gaze, he squints toward SOMEONE<Baer>. As the defending champ closes in, SOMEONE<Jim> envisions a hazy blanched view of Campbell crumbling under SOMEONE's<Baer's>

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS557
02:10:42,00 --> 02:10:51,50
blow. The fallen fighter's gaze drains of life. Back in the actual arena, SOMEONE<Jim> stays doubled over as

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS558
02:10:49,00 --> 02:10:53,50
SOMEONE<Baer> cock his arm back. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS559
02:10:54,00 --> 02:10:59,50
lands a left punch to SOMEONE's midriff and a hook 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS560
02:11:20,00 --> 02:11:24,50
SOMEONE<Jim> into a clinch. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS561
02:11:58,00 --> 02:12:03,50
with left and right hooks followed by an uppercut. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS562
02:12:02,00 --> 02:12:08,50
SOMEONE<Baer> reels then resumes his stance. Facing SOMEONE<Alice>. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS563
02:12:54,00 --> 02:13:01,50
In the arena, SOMEONE<Joe> hugs SOMEONE<Jim>. Jeanette puts a towel around the fighter's neck. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS564
02:13:08,00 --> 02:13:12,50
SOMEONE<Baer> eyes the crowd. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS565
02:13:14,00 --> 02:13:19,50
man unlaces SOMEONE's<Jim's> gloves. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS566
02:13:21,00 --> 02:13:26,50
As SOMEONE<Mae> sobs, SOMEONE<Alice> comforts her. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS568
02:13:42,00 --> 02:13:47,50
crosses toward the judges, SOMEONE<Joe> faces Jeanette. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS569
02:13:48,00 --> 02:13:53,50
They watch the judges confer with the ref. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS570
02:13:54,00 --> 02:14:00,50
A white mustached judge gestures adamantly. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS571
02:14:07,00 --> 02:14:11,50
The radio. In the ring, SOMEONE<Baer> looks around. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS572
02:14:27,00 --> 02:14:33,50
Women pray over their rosaries. In the arena, 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS573
02:14:34,00 --> 02:14:39,50
into the center of the ring. As the fighters in their corners 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS574
02:14:38,00 --> 02:14:45,50
The microphone lowers. The announcer removes his hat and lifts his face toward the mic. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS576
02:16:26,00 --> 02:16:31,50
turns and shakes hands with a gentleman in a suit. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS577
02:16:31,00 --> 02:16:35,50
It shows a packed arena. 

CINDERELLA_MAN_DVS578
02:16:35,00 --> 02:16:39,50
They join the champion.
