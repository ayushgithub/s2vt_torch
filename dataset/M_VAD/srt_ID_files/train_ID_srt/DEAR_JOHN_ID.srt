DEAR_JOHN_DVS25
00:02:44,00 --> 00:02:55,50
The bare-chested soldier watches the students halt at the end of the SOMEONE<pier>. A live young woman with wavy, corn silk hair, sets her purse on the railing. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS26
00:02:56,00 --> 00:03:02,50
A boyish guy sits on the railings, sending her purse plunging into the water. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS27
00:03:10,00 --> 00:03:32,50
As SOMEONE<Randy> jogs up the SOMEONE<pier> toward the beach, the soldier jumps off the railing and plummets 15 feet into the water. The blonde's jaw drops. Underwater, the soldier swims down along the SOMEONE's<pier's> barnacled supports. The purse stirs in the current, on the SOMEONE<debris> strewn ocean floor. The soldier seizes it, then kicks off the bottom and shoots back to the surface. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS28
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:39,50
The soldier swims toward the beach. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS29
00:03:36,00 --> 00:03:44,50
On the sand, SOMEONE<Randy> kicks off his flip-flops, and trots into the water, meeting the soldier in the surf. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS30
00:03:50,00 --> 00:03:54,50
The soldier delivers it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS31
00:03:53,00 --> 00:03:58,50
The smiling woman shakes her drenched bag. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS32
00:04:14,00 --> 00:04:18,50
SOMEONE<John> ambles off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS33
00:04:21,00 --> 00:04:25,50
SOMEONE<John> halts and walks back toward them. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS34
00:04:47,00 --> 00:04:51,50
He grabs his surfboard. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS35
00:04:54,00 --> 00:05:01,50
As SOMEONE<John> stares at SOMEONE<Savannah>, he accidentally bangs his board on the SOMEONE<pier>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS36
00:04:58,00 --> 00:05:03,50
They head off side by side. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS37
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:06,50
The setting sun casts long shadows over the sand. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS38
00:05:04,00 --> 00:05:08,50
Dear SOMEONE<John>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS39
00:05:05,00 --> 00:05:12,50
SOMEONE<Davi>, SOMEONE<Andrews>, SOMEONE<Scott> Porter, and SOMEONE<Richard> Jenkins. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS40
00:05:09,00 --> 00:05:15,50
Now a date appears. Spring 2001. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS41
00:05:13,00 --> 00:05:22,50
Guests mill about a SOMEONE<summer> beach house's natural un-landscaped yard. SOMEONE<Randy> and SOMEONE<John> sit in an unlit fire pit. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS42
00:05:35,00 --> 00:05:40,50
SOMEONE<Randy> notices a bulky ring on SOMEONE's<John's> finger. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS43
00:05:43,00 --> 00:05:47,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> brings SOMEONE<John> a beer. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS44
00:05:56,00 --> 00:06:01,50
SOMEONE<Randy> mimes throwing punches. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS45
00:06:01,00 --> 00:06:05,50
SOMEONE<John> eyes him, coolly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS46
00:06:04,00 --> 00:06:08,50
SOMEONE<Randy> salutes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS47
00:06:07,00 --> 00:06:11,50
He leaves. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS48
00:06:08,00 --> 00:06:14,50
SOMEONE<John> hangs his head with a subdued smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS49
00:06:22,00 --> 00:06:28,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> regards SOMEONE<John> candidly. Then allows a smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS50
00:06:25,00 --> 00:06:29,50
He looks away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS51
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:37,50
A tow-headed boy hugs her from behind. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS52
00:06:39,00 --> 00:06:44,50
The young boy beams. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS53
00:06:46,00 --> 00:06:51,50
SOMEONE<Alan> peers downward. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS54
00:06:54,00 --> 00:06:58,50
A bearded man joins them. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS55
00:07:06,00 --> 00:07:10,50
SOMEONE<Alan> plays with some driftwood. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS56
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:24,50
SOMEONE<John> glances at SOMEONE<Savannah>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS57
00:07:28,00 --> 00:07:34,50
SOMEONE<Alan> climbs over a log bench, and heads off with his father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS58
00:07:32,00 --> 00:07:36,50
He looks over his shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS59
00:07:37,00 --> 00:07:44,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> gapes, and SOMEONE<Tim> gives a stunned smirk. SOMEONE<Savannah> and SOMEONE<John> sit back down. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS60
00:07:55,00 --> 00:08:02,50
SOMEONE<John> drops his gaze, and SOMEONE<Savannah> studies him with a warm smile. They lock eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS62
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> and SOMEONE<John> ramble toward the water. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS63
00:08:20,00 --> 00:08:26,50
They halt among tufted beach grass, and gaze up at the moon. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS64
00:08:41,00 --> 00:08:46,50
As he demonstrates, she copies him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS65
00:08:46,00 --> 00:08:51,50
She covers the moon with her thumb. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS66
00:08:48,00 --> 00:08:53,50
SOMEONE<Randy> watches enviously from the fire pit. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS67
00:08:56,00 --> 00:09:05,50
Later, SOMEONE<John> whacks a striker bar against a magnesium strip key-chain, instantly igniting a small campfire. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS69
00:09:12,00 --> 00:09:18,50
Holding a hotdog on a stick, SOMEONE<John> grins. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS70
00:09:39,00 --> 00:09:46,50
SOMEONE<John> bashfully glances at the fire and turns away. Then faces SOMEONE<Savannah>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS71
00:09:57,00 --> 00:10:02,50
She nods, beaming. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS72
00:10:07,00 --> 00:10:13,50
He missteps, almost tripping into the fire. Then affects a cool recovery. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS73
00:10:17,00 --> 00:10:25,50
Later, SOMEONE<John> hobbles down a deserted road in his flip-flops, carrying his surfboard under one arm. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS74
00:10:22,00 --> 00:10:29,50
A pickup slows beside him. It's SOMEONE<Tim>. SOMEONE<Alan> ride shotgun. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS75
00:10:35,00 --> 00:10:39,50
He stumbles. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS76
00:10:46,00 --> 00:10:52,50
SOMEONE<John> loads his board into the bed of the truck. Later they drive. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS77
00:11:19,00 --> 00:11:24,50
SOMEONE<Tim> points at SOMEONE<Alan> with a nod. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS78
00:11:27,00 --> 00:11:38,50
SOMEONE<Alan> sways capriciously and tickles the men's necks. Now the truck stops before a modest home with a bushy tree in the front yard. SOMEONE<John> climbs out. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS79
00:12:16,00 --> 00:12:20,50
SOMEONE<John> heads off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS80
00:12:26,00 --> 00:12:30,50
He carries his board toward the house. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS81
00:12:30,00 --> 00:12:36,50
Now, SOMEONE<John> opens the front door and enters a room veiled in shadow. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS82
00:12:36,00 --> 00:12:50,50
In a study, a balding man wearing a single white glove examines a coin under a magnifying glass. SOMEONE<John> lifts the edge of a window shade covering the room's French door, and peeks inside at his father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS83
00:12:47,00 --> 00:12:53,50
The oblivious man's gaze remains locked on his coin. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS84
00:12:51,00 --> 00:12:56,50
SOMEONE<John> lets go of the shade and walks away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS85
00:12:53,00 --> 00:12:59,50
His father glances over his shoulder, then stares off glumly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS86
00:12:57,00 --> 00:13:01,50
SOMEONE<John> heads into his room. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS88
00:12:59,00 --> 00:13:05,50
Outside, laundry whips on a line in the wind. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS89
00:13:05,00 --> 00:13:09,50
In the kitchen. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS90
00:13:19,00 --> 00:13:30,50
SOMEONE's<John's> father purses his lips into a thoughtful frown, and digs in his pocket. He pulls out a set of keys and hands them to SOMEONE<John>, who ambles toward the door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS91
00:13:29,00 --> 00:13:36,50
Later, a sign on a shabby seaside building reads, Bowens Island Restaurant. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS92
00:13:45,00 --> 00:13:52,50
Loitering men spot SOMEONE<John> and swap looks. A goateed guy speaks up. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS93
00:13:50,00 --> 00:13:54,50
SOMEONE<John> inches over to him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS94
00:14:05,00 --> 00:14:11,50
SOMEONE<John> joins a puzzled SOMEONE<Savannah> a few steps ahead of him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS95
00:14:08,00 --> 00:14:12,50
Later in the restaurant. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS96
00:14:19,00 --> 00:14:24,50
SOMEONE<John> stares at SOMEONE<Savannah> blankly, and offers a fleeting grin. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS97
00:14:23,00 --> 00:14:27,50
She smiles back. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS98
00:14:26,00 --> 00:14:33,50
At twilight, two men fish on the dock outside the restaurant. Back inside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS99
00:14:59,00 --> 00:15:03,50
She smiles quizzically. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS100
00:15:07,00 --> 00:15:14,50
He munches some food. Eyes the rosy-cheeked young woman, then shyly bows his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS101
00:15:16,00 --> 00:15:22,50
SOMEONE<John> locks her in his sudden sobered gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS102
00:15:19,00 --> 00:15:24,50
Later, they stroll toward his front door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS103
00:15:28,00 --> 00:15:32,50
They head inside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS104
00:15:32,00 --> 00:15:37,50
SOMEONE's<John's> father looks up from his desk. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS105
00:15:36,00 --> 00:15:40,50
He stands to greet them. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS106
00:15:41,00 --> 00:15:45,50
She extends a hand. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS107
00:15:43,00 --> 00:15:48,50
He bashfully shakes it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS108
00:15:46,00 --> 00:15:50,50
She notices a coin collection. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS109
00:16:05,00 --> 00:16:09,50
He takes a coin from her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS110
00:16:11,00 --> 00:16:17,50
He rubs it vigorously on his shirt. Then peers at her through his glasses. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS111
00:16:23,00 --> 00:16:27,50
He gives her a white cotton glove. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS112
00:16:47,00 --> 00:16:52,50
He covers a wheel printed on the coin with a silver dollar. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS113
00:17:07,00 --> 00:17:11,50
He brings out more. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS114
00:17:20,00 --> 00:17:28,50
Now the SOMEONE<Tyree> family car pulls up in front of SOMEONE's<Savannah's> house. Riding with SOMEONE<John>, she beams. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS115
00:17:37,00 --> 00:17:45,50
SOMEONE<John> chews his pursed lips. Leaning over, SOMEONE<Savannah> gives him a kiss on the cheek. Then gets out of the car. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS116
00:17:51,00 --> 00:17:57,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> grins at him and shuts the door. He happily gazes after her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS118
00:17:56,00 --> 00:18:05,50
At the beach, SOMEONE<John> paddles his surfboard out over the breaking waves. He crests one, then swims farther out. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS119
00:18:03,00 --> 00:18:17,50
Later, he paddles with a flow of a swelling wave, as its foaming crest reaches his board, he gets to his feet and surfs it until it breaks. Later, he sits straddling his board, gazing at the houses along the shore. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS120
00:18:16,00 --> 00:18:22,50
Later still, he paddles out past a stone jetty. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS121
00:18:19,00 --> 00:18:26,50
At her house, SOMEONE<Savannah> steps out on her screened-in porch, and gazes toward the beach. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS122
00:18:23,00 --> 00:18:29,50
Now she walks with SOMEONE<John>, as he carries his board from the water. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS123
00:18:40,00 --> 00:18:44,50
They stroll toward her home. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS124
00:18:43,00 --> 00:18:49,50
Now they approach a partially constructed house. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS126
00:20:07,00 --> 00:20:13,50
Later, she leads him through the house's framework. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS127
00:20:32,00 --> 00:20:36,50
It starts to rain. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS128
00:20:40,00 --> 00:20:45,50
She leads him under a cluster of boards supported by a beam. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS129
00:20:49,00 --> 00:20:54,50
They stand close together. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS130
00:20:55,00 --> 00:20:59,50
She strokes his eyebrow. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS131
00:20:57,00 --> 00:21:02,50
Looking away, SOMEONE<John> works his mouth. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS132
00:21:06,00 --> 00:21:10,50
SOMEONE<John> shrugs. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS133
00:21:24,00 --> 00:21:30,50
SOMEONE<John> rests his cheek against the side of the beam. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS134
00:21:56,00 --> 00:22:04,50
SOMEONE<John> gazes tenderly at SOMEONE<Savannah>. He leans his face closer to her, and she smiles. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS135
00:22:01,00 --> 00:22:07,50
She lifts her chin and her nose brushes against his. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS136
00:22:04,00 --> 00:22:09,50
Opening her mouth, she kisses him hungrily. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS137
00:22:09,00 --> 00:22:21,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> drapes her arms around his neck, as they passionately make out. He lifts her up, and she wraps her legs around him. As SOMEONE<John> lowers himself to the floor, she straddles his lap. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS138
00:22:28,00 --> 00:22:41,50
Now, as they walk down a sidewalk, SOMEONE<John> clasps SOMEONE's<Savannah's> hand to his chest. At the sun dappled construction site, SOMEONE<Savannah> arrives to find him working at the top of a ladder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS139
00:22:38,00 --> 00:22:43,50
She stops, watching him appreciatively. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS140
00:22:41,00 --> 00:22:46,50
He spots her, and they share a warm smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS141
00:22:46,00 --> 00:22:58,50
Now, SOMEONE<John> holds his surfboard, tucked under his arm as they trod into the ocean. Later a wet-suit clad SOMEONE<Savannah>, crouches low on the board as she awkwardly rides a wave. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS142
00:22:55,00 --> 00:23:10,50
Tumbling into the shallow water, she grins. From the shore, her female friend pouts beside SOMEONE<Randy>, who sullenly watches the couple. Trying another wave, SOMEONE<Savannah> manages to stand briefly as SOMEONE<John> cheers her on. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS143
00:23:07,00 --> 00:23:17,50
Now, she hugs his arm as they walk hand in hand past a cafe. At the SOMEONE<Tyree> house, the young couple enjoys a meal with SOMEONE's<John's> father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS144
00:23:15,00 --> 00:23:24,50
Later, silhouetted by a dusky sky, SOMEONE<Savannah> frolics on the beach, playfully evading SOMEONE's<John's> grasp. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS145
00:23:21,00 --> 00:23:34,50
He finally catches her in his arms. Lifts her and spins. At the construction site, the couple adds a plywood board to a wall. She swats her hand in front of him, as he hammers it in place. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS146
00:23:46,00 --> 00:23:52,50
In a living room, SOMEONE<Savannah> sings and plays guitar for SOMEONE<John>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS147
00:23:55,00 --> 00:24:04,50
In a hallway, SOMEONE<John> sneaks up on her as she shuts a door. He turns her to face him, and they share a tender kiss. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS148
00:24:01,00 --> 00:24:06,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> peeks around a corner. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS149
00:24:06,00 --> 00:24:14,50
As his father paces in the living room, SOMEONE<John> carries his girlfriend upstairs. Now they tumble unto his bed. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS151
00:24:15,00 --> 00:24:20,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> slows, blinking. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS152
00:24:20,00 --> 00:24:26,50
He gives a startled turn, then stares off. His brow knitted. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS153
00:24:23,00 --> 00:24:31,50
Upstairs SOMEONE<Savannah> rolls off the bed, then scrambles to a closet and shuts herself in. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS154
00:24:31,00 --> 00:24:36,50
She pulls at the door knobs, but he yanks the doors open. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS155
00:24:34,00 --> 00:24:38,50
Pouncing at her side, he tickles her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS156
00:24:35,00 --> 00:24:43,50
As our view drifts upward, his armed uniform obscures them from view. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS157
00:24:42,00 --> 00:24:49,50
Back in the living room, SOMEONE<Savannah> smiles as she plays the guitar. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS158
00:24:49,00 --> 00:24:54,50
Reclining beside her, SOMEONE<John> beams appreciatively. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS159
00:24:51,00 --> 00:25:05,50
Now, tall reeds wave in a breeze as the young man hikes into view, and gazes ahead. On the beach, a small group plays volleyball amidst a boisterous party. Near a grill, SOMEONE<Tim> pats SOMEONE's<Alan's> shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS160
00:25:06,00 --> 00:25:12,50
Another group sits around two young men playing acoustic guitars. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS161
00:25:10,00 --> 00:25:16,50
SOMEONE<John> hangs back, pensively taking in the cheerful scene. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS162
00:25:13,00 --> 00:25:20,50
Turning, he spots a solitary figure sitting alone at the base of a grassy dune. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS163
00:25:20,00 --> 00:25:29,50
At the volleyball net, SOMEONE<Randy> pauses. He watches his rival cross to the dune, then turns back to his game. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS164
00:25:26,00 --> 00:25:36,50
SOMEONE<John> hikes along a grassy ridge towards SOMEONE<Savannah>, and sneaks down behind her. He playfully grabs her side, startling the live young beauty. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS165
00:25:55,00 --> 00:26:00,50
She smiles contentedly in his arms. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS166
00:26:29,00 --> 00:26:34,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> lowers her troubled gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS167
00:26:31,00 --> 00:26:36,50
Pulling her closer, SOMEONE<John> kisses her brow. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS168
00:26:38,00 --> 00:26:43,50
He rocks her in his arms. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS169
00:26:50,00 --> 00:26:56,50
Her lips creep into a faint smile, and he kisses her brow again. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS170
00:26:55,00 --> 00:27:01,50
Turning, SOMEONE<Savannah> wraps her arms around him and lays him back against the dune. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS171
00:27:01,00 --> 00:27:06,50
Later, they stroll toward the party. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS172
00:27:03,00 --> 00:27:14,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> trots ahead a few paces and bends to pick up a seashell. As she straightens and pockets it, SOMEONE<John> drapes a loving arm around her shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS173
00:27:42,00 --> 00:27:47,50
He stops and faces her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS174
00:28:03,00 --> 00:28:08,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> lowers her gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS175
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:44,50
SOMEONE<John> starts to speak, then turns away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS176
00:28:43,00 --> 00:28:48,50
He sulks off, leaving his girlfriend behind. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS177
00:28:45,00 --> 00:28:50,50
Reaching the party, he heads up a boardwalk. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS178
00:28:51,00 --> 00:28:55,50
SOMEONE<Randy> tosses him a can. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS179
00:28:54,00 --> 00:28:58,50
SOMEONE<John> chucks it aside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS180
00:29:00,00 --> 00:29:04,50
SOMEONE<Randy> pulls him aside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS181
00:29:09,00 --> 00:29:18,50
He touches SOMEONE's<John's> chest. The soldier flings him to the ground. His buddy runs over, and SOMEONE<John> punches him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS182
00:29:15,00 --> 00:29:22,50
SOMEONE<Tim> rushes up behind the soldier. SOMEONE<John> elbows him in the face. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS183
00:29:19,00 --> 00:29:29,50
Glaring lividly, SOMEONE<Savannah> smacks his arm. SOMEONE<John> faces her briefly, then leaves. SOMEONE<Tim> cups a hand over his nose. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS184
00:29:27,00 --> 00:29:32,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> crouches to him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS185
00:29:29,00 --> 00:29:40,50
At dusk, SOMEONE<John> hikes along a dirt road. His feature obscured by shadow. An SUV rounds a turn, pulls up beside him, and continues on. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS186
00:29:37,00 --> 00:29:44,50
Silhouetted against the gray sky, SOMEONE<John> bows his head. His stride unbroken. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS188
00:29:45,00 --> 00:29:52,50
Daytime, SOMEONE<John> stands on SOMEONE's<Savannah's> porch, knocking on the screen door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS189
00:29:49,00 --> 00:29:56,50
In the next yard, SOMEONE<Tim> takes out the trash, sporting a black eye and a swollen nose. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS190
00:29:59,00 --> 00:30:03,50
SOMEONE<John> approaches him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS191
00:30:05,00 --> 00:30:10,50
SOMEONE<Tim> shrugs his hand and steps forward. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS192
00:30:07,00 --> 00:30:12,50
Getting a look at his face, SOMEONE<John> slows. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS193
00:30:44,00 --> 00:30:50,50
SOMEONE<Tim> fishes a scrap of paper from the trash bin. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS194
00:30:48,00 --> 00:30:54,50
SOMEONE<John> meets the kind man who hands him the paper with a pen. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS195
00:30:55,00 --> 00:30:59,50
SOMEONE<Tim> nods, and steps away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS196
00:30:58,00 --> 00:31:04,50
Now an oven door opens, revealing two pans of lasagna. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS197
00:31:01,00 --> 00:31:09,50
A pair of hands and oven mitts take them out and sets them on a stove. SOMEONE<John> wanders into the kitchen. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS198
00:31:15,00 --> 00:31:33,50
SOMEONE<John> shuffles into the dining room. His father closes the oven door, crosses to an island counter and watches him. The young man clears one of three place settings from the dining room table. Taking it into the kitchen, he sets the plate, place mat and glass on the island. His father looks on as he starts to put the silverware away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS199
00:31:40,00 --> 00:31:45,50
SOMEONE<John> puts the silverware back down. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS200
00:31:44,00 --> 00:31:50,50
As he steps away, Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> methodically sets the silverware aside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS201
00:31:49,00 --> 00:31:58,50
He picks up the plate in both hands. Sets it at a precise angle in a wooden case, and slides a glass door close in front of it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS202
00:31:55,00 --> 00:32:05,50
Later, we watch through a doorway, as father and son eat at the dining room table. SOMEONE<John> gazes off as he chews, then looks down at his plate. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS203
00:32:07,00 --> 00:32:12,50
His father picks at his food. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS204
00:32:12,00 --> 00:32:17,50
SOMEONE<John> watches him with a concerned expression. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS205
00:32:14,00 --> 00:32:22,50
With a melancholy stare, Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> scoops a large fork full of lasagna into his mouth and chews. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS206
00:32:22,00 --> 00:32:32,50
He turns, facing a window. SOMEONE<John> follows his gaze to find SOMEONE's<Savannah's> car pulling up outside. Standing, he leaves the table. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS207
00:32:32,00 --> 00:32:41,50
He goes outside and jogs down off the porch. Getting out of her car, SOMEONE<Savannah> faces him with an affectionate smirk. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS208
00:32:44,00 --> 00:32:47,50
They embrace. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS209
00:33:11,00 --> 00:33:15,50
He caresses her corn silk hair. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS210
00:33:14,00 --> 00:33:19,50
He kisses her smooth forehead. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS211
00:33:17,00 --> 00:33:21,50
She warps her arms around him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS212
00:33:23,00 --> 00:33:29,50
She gives him an envelope and he starts to open it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS213
00:33:46,00 --> 00:33:52,50
He drapes an arm around her shoulder and she hugs his waist as they head inside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS214
00:33:57,00 --> 00:34:01,50
Now they eat dinner with SOMEONE's<John's> father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS215
00:34:02,00 --> 00:34:09,50
Later as SOMEONE<Savannah> sits in her car, SOMEONE<John> leans through the window and playfully grapples with her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS216
00:34:07,00 --> 00:34:17,50
She turns her face toward his and kisses him. In the house, Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> looks up from his coins. A window shows SOMEONE's<Savannah's> car pulling away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS217
00:34:18,00 --> 00:34:23,50
SOMEONE<John> gazes after her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS218
00:34:23,00 --> 00:34:29,50
His image recedes as she drives away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS219
00:34:26,00 --> 00:34:32,50
With glistening eyes, SOMEONE<Savannah> watches him through her rear-view mirror. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS220
00:34:29,00 --> 00:34:34,50
She tearfully looks away, and watches the road. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS221
00:34:32,00 --> 00:34:36,50
Now at a bus station. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS222
00:34:40,00 --> 00:34:44,50
He takes two bags from his father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS223
00:34:46,00 --> 00:34:50,50
The young man boards a waiting bus. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS224
00:34:48,00 --> 00:34:58,50
Its long side window shows Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> lingering on the spot, staring off as he stuffs his hands into his pockets. The bus pulls away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS225
00:35:07,00 --> 00:35:12,50
On the bus, SOMEONE<John> reads SOMEONE's<Savannah's> letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS226
00:35:17,00 --> 00:35:23,50
Now amongst sleeping soldiers, SOMEONE<John> reads by flashlight. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS227
00:35:24,00 --> 00:35:28,50
Daytime at an airfield. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS228
00:35:30,00 --> 00:35:37,50
The soldiers file off a plane in their camouflaged uniforms. Each carrying a duffel. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS229
00:35:34,00 --> 00:35:41,50
SOMEONE<John> exits the aircraft, squinting in the sun and proceeds across the tarmac. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS231
00:35:50,00 --> 00:35:55,50
He eyes one of his peers. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS232
00:35:54,00 --> 00:35:59,50
The dark-haired soldier stares defeatedly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS233
00:36:12,00 --> 00:36:24,50
Their mustached superior leaves. SOMEONE<John> lowers his gaze. At dusk, the platoon crosses the airfield and climbs the boarding steps of a cargo plane. On board, SOMEONE<John> writes a letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS234
00:36:32,00 --> 00:36:38,50
Now a helicopter descends. SOMEONE<John> rides on board among the others. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS235
00:36:39,00 --> 00:36:43,50
He gazes at passing trees. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS236
00:36:43,00 --> 00:36:53,50
The soldiers hop out of the landed chopper, one by one. Now they enter a crude village where a calf drinks from ruts of sitting water. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS237
00:37:02,00 --> 00:37:06,50
He hands a letter to a pilot. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS238
00:37:07,00 --> 00:37:12,50
SOMEONE<John> watches the helicopter take off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS239
00:37:25,00 --> 00:37:50,50
Now multiple letters travel along four conveyor belts. One of them addressed to SOMEONE<Savannah> Curtis. Letters flip vertically through a machine. A bin of bundled letters slides down a track, and a postal worker sorts the letters into cubbies. On a college campus, a mailman takes a few letters from his satchel and places them into one of many PO boxes. From inside the PO box, we see SOMEONE<Savannah> take out her mail. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS240
00:37:48,00 --> 00:37:54,50
On finding SOMEONE's<John's> letter, she smiles.  

DEAR_JOHN_DVS241
00:37:57,00 --> 00:38:02,50
She reads on her way to class. SOMEONE<John> instructs African troops.  

DEAR_JOHN_DVS242
00:38:14,00 --> 00:38:19,50
In a lecture, SOMEONE<Randy> sees SOMEONE<Savannah> reading. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS243
00:38:17,00 --> 00:38:23,50
SOMEONE's<John's> dark-haired buddy goes through the newly receive mail. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS244
00:38:32,00 --> 00:38:36,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> reads. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS245
00:38:34,00 --> 00:38:49,50
Now, African women play drums and dance. Soldiers walk among merchants set up along a dirt road. A soldier in sunglasses chats with two local men. Another soldier exits a house and pats SOMEONE<John>, who sits on a porch reading. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS246
00:38:56,00 --> 00:39:02,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> leaves a horse and runs across the front yard to greet SOMEONE<Alan>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS247
00:39:01,00 --> 00:39:05,50
She picks him up and twirls. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS248
00:39:05,00 --> 00:39:08,50
Now they ride horses. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS252
00:39:13,00 --> 00:39:17,50
She grins at the boy. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS253
00:39:36,00 --> 00:39:42,50
Leaning on a fence, SOMEONE<Tim> and SOMEONE<Savannah> watch SOMEONE<Alan> feed a horse. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS254
00:39:53,00 --> 00:39:57,50
SOMEONE<John> writes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS255
00:39:57,00 --> 00:40:03,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> reads attentively. Nighttime in a tent. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS256
00:40:07,00 --> 00:40:14,50
SOMEONE<John> grabs the letter from him. Now SOMEONE<Savannah> receives another. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS257
00:40:37,00 --> 00:40:41,50
She gazes at the moon. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS258
00:40:45,00 --> 00:40:50,50
She covers the moon with her thumb. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS259
00:40:52,00 --> 00:40:57,50
Her cheeks flushed. She holds her gaze steady. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS260
00:40:54,00 --> 00:40:59,50
Now at Mr. SOMEONE's<Tyree's> house. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS261
00:40:58,00 --> 00:41:02,50
He hesitates at the door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS262
00:41:36,00 --> 00:41:42,50
He retrieves a small case from a lower drawer. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS263
00:41:39,00 --> 00:41:45,50
Then takes out a coin, which he holds under a magnifying glass. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS264
00:41:42,00 --> 00:41:48,50
Flipping the nickel over, he reveals the back of a penny. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS265
00:42:07,00 --> 00:42:14,50
He glances around the desk, and finds another coin. SOMEONE<Savannah> smiles. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS266
00:42:17,00 --> 00:42:22,50
Riding in the bed of a transport truck, SOMEONE reads "What's the story?". 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS268
00:42:21,00 --> 00:42:25,50
He stares off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS269
00:42:26,00 --> 00:42:33,50
In a flashback, a boy receives a handful of change from an ice-cream vendor. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS270
00:42:33,00 --> 00:42:38,50
Leaving the van, the boy studies his change. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS271
00:42:39,00 --> 00:42:44,50
Young SOMEONE<John> licks his ice-cream cone. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS272
00:42:41,00 --> 00:42:47,50
Later his dad's fingers rinse the peculiar coin under the faucet. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS273
00:42:44,00 --> 00:42:51,50
In the kitchen, a younger Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> studies the coin and shakes his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS274
00:42:54,00 --> 00:42:58,50
He glances at the boy. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS275
00:42:59,00 --> 00:43:03,50
Now at a pawn shop. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS276
00:43:28,00 --> 00:43:34,50
SOMEONE<John> brightens, his grin missing a couple baby teeth. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS277
00:43:34,00 --> 00:43:40,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> collects the coin and tugs his son away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS278
00:43:39,00 --> 00:43:46,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> hurries down a sidewalk and briefly stops for SOMEONE<John> to catch up. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS279
00:43:43,00 --> 00:43:47,50
In another store. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS280
00:43:49,00 --> 00:43:59,50
The clerk sets the coin on a square napkin. Bends down and digs under his counter to retrieve a pamphlet titled, The Four Thousand Dollar Mule. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS281
00:44:21,00 --> 00:44:25,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> looks at his son. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS282
00:44:26,00 --> 00:44:30,50
SOMEONE<John> nods. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS283
00:44:28,00 --> 00:44:32,50
The clerk grins. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS284
00:44:31,00 --> 00:44:35,50
Now at another coin shop. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS285
00:44:40,00 --> 00:44:45,50
They view coins on display. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS286
00:44:45,00 --> 00:44:49,50
We tour a collection. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS287
00:44:51,00 --> 00:44:57,50
Now older SOMEONE<John> takes milk out of the fridge. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS288
00:44:56,00 --> 00:45:00,50
He drinks from the carton. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS289
00:45:05,00 --> 00:45:11,50
He tosses the carton back inside and shuts the door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS290
00:45:08,00 --> 00:45:14,50
His father opens the door and stands the carton upright. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS291
00:45:11,00 --> 00:45:16,50
Now Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> studies a coin. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS292
00:45:17,00 --> 00:45:22,50
SOMEONE<John> goes to a stereo in the living room. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS293
00:45:22,00 --> 00:45:31,50
His father looks up from a coin. Seen distantly through the doorway, SOMEONE<John> leaves the stereo and walks out of sight. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS294
00:45:31,00 --> 00:45:36,50
His dad glances over his shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS295
00:45:36,00 --> 00:45:52,50
On campus, a passing student bumps into SOMEONE<Savannah> as she reads. At the bottom of a staircase, she reaches a walkway where frantic peers gather and talk on cellphones. A confused SOMEONE<Savannah> holds SOMEONE's<John's> letter with both hands as she observes the anxious activity. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS296
00:45:55,00 --> 00:46:24,50
As SOMEONE<Savannah> remains frozen, our view is sent to take in a bird's eye view of the chaos. Now wearing plain clothes, SOMEONE<John> walks alone on a busy street in an eastern European town. A horse-drawn cart, a woman on a bicycle, and a man on a scooter crosses path. SOMEONE<John> approaches a cafe, where pedestrians gather outside. Reaching the entrance, SOMEONE<John> joins his dark-haired buddy to watch television news coverage. Black smoke billows from one of New York City's Twin Towers. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS297
00:46:21,00 --> 00:46:27,50
SOMEONE<John> breathes heavily as he watches SOMEONE<debris> falling off the building. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS298
00:46:25,00 --> 00:46:28,50
Fade to black. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS299
00:46:26,00 --> 00:46:32,50
Now in a hanger, the soldier’s superior approaches. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS300
00:46:36,00 --> 00:46:40,50
SOMEONE<John> packs. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS301
00:46:40,00 --> 00:46:44,50
SOMEONE's<John's> friend rises. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS302
00:47:09,00 --> 00:47:15,50
SOMEONE<John>, the only one left seated, lowers his gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS303
00:47:12,00 --> 00:47:19,50
Later in a conference room, he shakes hands with two soldiers then grabs his bag. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS304
00:47:36,00 --> 00:47:41,50
He eyes his dark-haired friend. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS305
00:47:45,00 --> 00:47:50,50
Now a gray cargo plane lands on an airstrip. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS306
00:47:48,00 --> 00:47:55,50
Inside a crowded airport, SOMEONE<Savannah> sees SOMEONE<John> on the other side of a security gate. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS307
00:47:55,00 --> 00:48:06,50
She ducks under a dividing rope, and hurries around to the other side. SOMEONE<John> notices her and beams. She runs to him and leaps into his arms. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS308
00:48:03,00 --> 00:48:08,50
As he spins her around, they kiss. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS309
00:48:05,00 --> 00:48:11,50
A heavy-set traveler eyes them as he takes off his belt. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS310
00:48:08,00 --> 00:48:14,50
Another man eyes them, holding out his arms for a guard. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS311
00:48:12,00 --> 00:48:25,50
Later while SOMEONE<Savannah> drives, SOMEONE<John> raises her free hand to his lips. He rubs her hand with his chin, then she strokes the back of his head, fondle his ear, and caresses his cheek. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS312
00:48:23,00 --> 00:48:34,50
SOMEONE<John> brushes her long blonde hair behind her shoulder. As he gazes at her, thumbing her hair around her ear, she meets his gaze and smiles. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS313
00:48:31,00 --> 00:48:36,50
Now, outside his father's house. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS314
00:48:40,00 --> 00:48:44,50
They approach the front door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS315
00:48:47,00 --> 00:48:53,50
Inside, Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> sits on a chair and buttons a suit jacket. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS316
00:48:50,00 --> 00:48:56,50
Behind him, the front door opens, and the couple enters. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS317
00:48:57,00 --> 00:49:02,50
SOMEONE<John> walks off, then returns to the sitting room. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS319
00:49:19,00 --> 00:49:24,50
They follow him into the kitchen. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS320
00:49:29,00 --> 00:49:33,50
He takes out the pan. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS321
00:49:33,00 --> 00:49:46,50
Now Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> sits in the back seat of SOMEONE's<Savannah's> blue Volkswagen, as they drive away. On a country road, he nervously stares at the foiled wrapped meatloaf nestled in a cardboard box on his lap. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS323
00:50:07,00 --> 00:50:13,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> glances at SOMEONE<John>. Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> squeezes his brow. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS324
00:50:18,00 --> 00:50:30,50
Grimacing, he grabs at the door. SOMEONE<John> reaches back. The car stops and Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> gets out. A disheartened SOMEONE<John> remains in the passenger seat, and rests his elbow on the window sill. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS325
00:50:27,00 --> 00:50:33,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> slouches at the side of the road. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS326
00:50:41,00 --> 00:50:46,50
She touches his back, and he walks off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS327
00:50:47,00 --> 00:50:54,50
He walks a few paces away, then halts and hunches forward, catching his breath. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS328
00:50:52,00 --> 00:50:57,50
Now at the SOMEONE<Tyree> house, they get out of the car. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS329
00:51:03,00 --> 00:51:07,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> goes to the front door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS330
00:51:07,00 --> 00:51:11,50
His father pauses. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS331
00:51:15,00 --> 00:51:19,50
He enters the house. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS332
00:51:18,00 --> 00:51:25,50
SOMEONE<John> glances at SOMEONE<Savannah>, rolls his eyes, then returns to the car. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS333
00:51:22,00 --> 00:51:26,50
Later on the road. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS334
00:51:25,00 --> 00:51:30,50
SOMEONE<John> meets her gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS335
00:51:30,00 --> 00:51:35,50
They both stare ahead somberly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS336
00:51:33,00 --> 00:51:39,50
Now SOMEONE's<Savannah's> car pulls onto a private road. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS337
00:51:37,00 --> 00:51:47,50
A stylish brunette woman in a white dress, crosses the front porch of a colonial plantation home, and greets arriving guests as she passes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS338
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:52,50
She hugs SOMEONE<Savannah>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS339
00:52:01,00 --> 00:52:09,50
Well over a dozen cars sit parked on the front lawn. Inside, guests mingle over drinks and hor d'oeuvres. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS340
00:52:22,00 --> 00:52:27,50
SOMEONE<Randy> offers his hand. SOMEONE<John> ignores him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS341
00:52:44,00 --> 00:52:49,50
SOMEONE<Randy> returns and offers SOMEONE<John> a drink. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS342
00:52:52,00 --> 00:52:57,50
SOMEONE<John> takes the drink and averts his gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS343
00:53:08,00 --> 00:53:12,50
SOMEONE<John> nods. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS344
00:53:16,00 --> 00:53:21,50
A cigar-smoking man approaches SOMEONE<John>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS345
00:53:47,00 --> 00:53:52,50
As her father leaves, SOMEONE<Tim> joins them. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS346
00:53:52,00 --> 00:53:56,50
A blonde woman joins them. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS347
00:54:05,00 --> 00:54:09,50
The woman and SOMEONE<Savannah> leave. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS348
00:54:09,00 --> 00:54:14,50
The boy collects hor d'oeuvres on a plate. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS349
00:54:15,00 --> 00:54:20,50
SOMEONE<Tim> looks around self-consciously. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS350
00:54:20,00 --> 00:54:24,50
SOMEONE<Tim> sips his bourbon. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS351
00:54:58,00 --> 00:55:02,50
SOMEONE<Tim> nods and glances off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS352
00:55:11,00 --> 00:55:15,50
SOMEONE<Tim> nods. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS353
00:55:40,00 --> 00:55:45,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> eyes him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS354
00:55:43,00 --> 00:55:47,50
SOMEONE<John> deflates. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS355
00:55:46,00 --> 00:55:52,50
Now on the porch, SOMEONE<John> paces behind SOMEONE<Savannah>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS356
00:55:49,00 --> 00:55:59,50
She leans on the railing, gazing out over the lawn as departing guests find their cars. He stands behind her, and she lowers her gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS357
00:55:57,00 --> 00:56:02,50
She flinches and shifts away from him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS358
00:55:59,00 --> 00:56:04,50
SOMEONE<John> bows his head and faces her from the side. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS359
00:56:15,00 --> 00:56:20,50
She looks at him ascant, then faces him fully. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS360
00:56:29,00 --> 00:56:35,50
She grimaces, agonizing and SOMEONE<John> lowers his gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS361
00:56:41,00 --> 00:56:51,50
She storms past him and disappears down the front steps, leaving him alone on the porch. SOMEONE<John> watches her go, then swallows hard and hangs his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS362
00:56:53,00 --> 00:57:05,50
Now as guests stroll around the Curtis' expansive grounds, SOMEONE<John> finds SOMEONE<Savannah> siting alone on a bench overlooking a marsh. His pace slows as he draws closer. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS363
00:57:05,00 --> 00:57:10,50
He gazes out at the wetlands as he waits a few feet away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS364
00:58:10,00 --> 00:58:22,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> clasps SOMEONE's<John's> head in her hands, then wraps her arms around his neck and pulls him into a tight embrace. She rests her chin on his shoulder as he holds her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS365
00:58:22,00 --> 00:58:29,50
She meets his gaze, then draws his face closer and kisses his forehead. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS366
00:58:30,00 --> 00:58:41,50
Leading him by the hand, SOMEONE<Savannah> takes SOMEONE<John> to her family's stables. Inside, she leans back against a wall as she unbuttons his dress shirt. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS367
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:44,50
He caresses her hair, then lovingly kisses her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS368
00:58:46,00 --> 00:58:52,50
Dim blue light outlines SOMEONE's<Savannah's> corn silk hair. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS369
00:58:54,00 --> 00:59:02,50
SOMEONE<John> nuzzles the top of her head, as he sweeps her long blonde locks behind her back. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS370
00:58:59,00 --> 00:59:08,50
She parts his shirt, and slips it off his shoulders. Then wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him hungrily. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS371
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:19,50
As SOMEONE<John> kisses SOMEONE's<Savannah's> neck, she lowers her dress and presses her body against his. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS372
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:25,50
Now, SOMEONE's<John's> toned upper body hovers above SOMEONE<Savannah>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS373
00:59:23,00 --> 00:59:29,50
Propped up by his arms, as she pulls his undershirt over his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS374
00:59:27,00 --> 00:59:31,50
She then removes her bra. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS375
00:59:31,00 --> 00:59:38,50
He lowers himself on top of her, and meets her lips with a passionate kiss. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS376
00:59:37,00 --> 00:59:43,50
The muscles in his shoulders ripple as he and SOMEONE<Savannah> make love. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS377
00:59:44,00 --> 00:59:53,50
He kisses her shoulder, then trails his lips from the tip of her chin, down her neck, and gently caresses her hair. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS379
00:59:53,00 --> 01:00:02,50
He lies beside her, his arm reaching across her body, to stroke her corn silk tresses with his fingertips. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS380
00:59:59,00 --> 01:00:03,50
They kiss sweetly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS381
01:00:03,00 --> 01:00:10,50
She stares distantly. Her hand clasping SOMEONE's<John's> smooth freckled shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS383
01:00:09,00 --> 01:00:13,50
With a wistful look, she closes her eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS384
01:00:11,00 --> 01:00:16,50
A tear slides out. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS385
01:00:13,00 --> 01:00:17,50
Glistening in the light. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS386
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:19,50
And rests at the corner of her eye. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS387
01:00:18,00 --> 01:00:26,50
Now SOMEONE<Savannah> and SOMEONE<John> hold hands as they stroll outside the stable into the daylight. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS388
01:00:25,00 --> 01:00:32,50
SOMEONE<John> carries her heels, and she wears his jacket over her dress. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS389
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:39,50
A wider view shows warm sunlight glinting through Spanish moss on a tree, as the couple embraces in front of the stables. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS390
01:00:38,00 --> 01:00:45,50
Now wearing his fatigues, SOMEONE<John> enters the airport with SOMEONE<Savannah> by his side. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS391
01:00:42,00 --> 01:00:48,50
He spots his father waiting at a security checkpoint. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS392
01:00:45,00 --> 01:00:51,50
As the couple draws closer, a grin crosses SOMEONE's<John's> face. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS393
01:00:53,00 --> 01:00:58,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> smiles briefly, but avoids his gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS394
01:00:56,00 --> 01:01:02,50
SOMEONE<John> glances at SOMEONE<Savannah>, who grins at Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS395
01:01:04,00 --> 01:01:10,50
SOMEONE<John> shares a quick look with SOMEONE<Savannah>, who turns away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS396
01:01:07,00 --> 01:01:11,50
He faces his father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS397
01:01:16,00 --> 01:01:20,50
They exchange smiles. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS398
01:01:18,00 --> 01:01:23,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> shifts his gaze uneasily. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS399
01:01:28,00 --> 01:01:35,50
SOMEONE<John> extends his hand. With his eyes averted, Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> shakes it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS400
01:01:32,00 --> 01:01:47,50
The soldier awkwardly watches his father, then turns to SOMEONE<Savannah>, who waits a few steps away. As she faces SOMEONE<John>, Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> walks past them and exits the airport. SOMEONE<John> bends down and wraps his arms around SOMEONE's<Savannah's> waist. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS401
01:01:44,00 --> 01:01:49,50
They embrace tightly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS402
01:01:50,00 --> 01:01:54,50
SOMEONE<John> straightens. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS403
01:01:57,00 --> 01:02:04,50
Clasping his neck, SOMEONE<Savannah> kisses SOMEONE<John>, then rests her forehead against his. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS404
01:02:02,00 --> 01:02:07,50
He lifts his lips and kisses the top of her head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS405
01:02:05,00 --> 01:02:09,50
She looks up at him, tearfully. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS406
01:02:21,00 --> 01:02:26,50
Tears shine in her red rimmed eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS407
01:02:24,00 --> 01:02:30,50
The corner of SOMEONE's<John's> mouth twitches into a tiny smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS408
01:02:28,00 --> 01:02:32,50
He and SOMEONE<Savannah> kiss desperately. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS409
01:02:31,00 --> 01:02:40,50
She cups SOMEONE's<John's> face in her hands as she kisses him one last time, then turns away and strides out of the airport. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS410
01:02:38,00 --> 01:02:43,50
SOMEONE<John> clenches his jaw as he watches her leave. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS411
01:02:40,00 --> 01:02:48,50
Outside, she glances over her shoulder and smiles at him, then continues away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS412
01:02:45,00 --> 01:02:53,50
Now in a military plane, SOMEONE<John> lies on some cargo netting as it takes off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS413
01:02:53,00 --> 01:02:58,50
Later in the hanger on base. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS414
01:03:02,00 --> 01:03:06,50
The captain observes his men. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS415
01:03:05,00 --> 01:03:11,50
Sitting on a crate, SOMEONE<John> furrows his brow thoughtfully. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS416
01:03:09,00 --> 01:03:15,50
He rises and stands at attention, joining the rest of his team. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS417
01:03:12,00 --> 01:03:16,50
The captain nods. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS418
01:03:23,00 --> 01:03:31,50
As the captain heads off, our bird's eye view of his men swings down to watch them collect their belongings. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS419
01:03:31,00 --> 01:03:39,50
Now, an image of SOMEONE's<Savannah's> address handwritten on an envelope, drifts into view. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS420
01:03:36,00 --> 01:03:42,50
In Afghanistan, SOMEONE<John> patrols a bustling street. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS421
01:03:39,00 --> 01:03:44,50
He pauses to talk to a young boy. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS422
01:03:42,00 --> 01:03:48,50
In a close-up of SOMEONE's<John's> letter, we glimpse fragments of sentences. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS424
01:03:47,00 --> 01:03:54,50
Just not the same without you. Rises and sets for both of us, is what helps me survive day to day. Love SOMEONE<John>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS426
01:03:53,00 --> 01:03:58,50
In a college classroom SOMEONE<Savannah> writes thoughtfully. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS427
01:03:56,00 --> 01:04:03,50
A close-up shows her pen gracefully filling a page with elegant cursive. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS428
01:04:01,00 --> 01:04:08,50
Back in Afghanistan, a pallet drops from a plane, and a parachute opens above it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS429
01:04:10,00 --> 01:04:18,50
Later, two soldiers approach the fallen crate. SOMEONE<John> heads over and receives a mailbag. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS430
01:04:18,00 --> 01:04:24,50
At the army camp, he distributes letters to soldiers. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS431
01:04:26,00 --> 01:04:31,50
With a letter in his hand, SOMEONE<John> sits on a cot. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS432
01:04:29,00 --> 01:04:35,50
Now, a close-up shows a smooth cursive signature. Always SOMEONE<Savannah>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS434
01:04:33,00 --> 01:04:47,50
SOMEONE<John> drops some letters on top of others in a metal box. Then closes the lid. He kicks it under his cot as he begins to write a reply on a pad of paper. In Charleston, SOMEONE<Savannah> and SOMEONE<Alan> ride horses together. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS435
01:04:45,00 --> 01:04:50,50
Back in Afghanistan, SOMEONE<John> trains another soldier. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS437
01:04:55,00 --> 01:04:59,50
The soldier fires at a target. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS438
01:04:56,00 --> 01:05:01,50
SOMEONE<John> pats him on the back. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS439
01:04:58,00 --> 01:05:05,50
Close-ups of a pen show him writing the dates on more letters to SOMEONE<Savannah>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS440
01:05:02,00 --> 01:05:07,50
June, September, December. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS441
01:05:09,00 --> 01:05:19,50
In Charleston, moonlight shines across SOMEONE's<Savannah's> face as she lies awake in bed. Our view of the moon morphs into the blazing sun. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS442
01:05:16,00 --> 01:05:25,50
In Afghanistan, SOMEONE<John> riffles through a pile of letters. With a disappointed look, he turns away from the mailbag. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS443
01:05:23,00 --> 01:05:27,50
Now he cleans a gun. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS444
01:05:24,00 --> 01:05:31,50
Glancing up, he notices a soldier reclined on a cot, and reading a letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS445
01:05:29,00 --> 01:05:36,50
In Charleston, SOMEONE<Savannah> sits alone on the beach. She closes her eyes regretfully. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS446
01:05:33,00 --> 01:05:40,50
In Afghanistan, SOMEONE's<John's> dark-haired buddy, passes him with a mailbag. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS447
01:05:43,00 --> 01:05:48,50
SOMEONE<John> hangs his head as the soldier walks away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS448
01:05:45,00 --> 01:05:52,50
Now, SOMEONE<John> cautiously glances around as he steps into a tent. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS449
01:05:49,00 --> 01:05:59,50
He finds a cellphone on a desk, and reaches for it. Sitting down, he dials, then lifts the phone to his ear. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS450
01:06:08,00 --> 01:06:18,50
Now dust billows as a bundled pallet parachutes to the ground. Later, a soldier opens a mailbag and searches its contents. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS451
01:06:15,00 --> 01:06:25,50
Now, SOMEONE's<John's> dark-haired buddy carries a letter in one hand, and the mailbag in the other, as he enters the fenced-in base camp. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS452
01:06:23,00 --> 01:06:32,50
Passing a group of soldiers playing football, he approaches other lounging on picnic tables outside a tent. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS453
01:06:36,00 --> 01:06:40,50
He heads into the tent. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS454
01:06:38,00 --> 01:06:43,50
SOMEONE<John> sits at a weight machine. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS455
01:06:45,00 --> 01:06:49,50
He hands SOMEONE<John> the thin envelope. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS456
01:06:47,00 --> 01:06:53,50
SOMEONE<John> thoughtfully runs his thumb over it. Gauging its weight. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS457
01:06:50,00 --> 01:06:55,50
Later, he sits outside and reads the letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS458
01:07:33,00 --> 01:07:38,50
SOMEONE<John> trudges into his tent with the letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS459
01:07:38,00 --> 01:07:42,50
He sits on his cot. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS460
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:45,50
SOMEONE<John> glances at the other soldiers. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS461
01:07:47,00 --> 01:07:52,50
He lowers his miserable gaze to the handwritten pages. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS462
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:56,50
SOMEONE<John> lifts his head into the sunlight, and bites his lip resolutely. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS463
01:07:58,00 --> 01:08:03,50
Reaching under his cot, 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS464
01:08:00,00 --> 01:08:09,50
he extracts the metal box and carries it outside. As he pries off its cover, he fumbles it, and it falls to the ground. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS465
01:08:09,00 --> 01:08:15,50
As SOMEONE<John> retrieves his spilled letters, a soldier passes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS466
01:08:15,00 --> 01:08:20,50
Now, flames dance inside a trash can. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS467
01:08:18,00 --> 01:08:27,50
SOMEONE<John> tosses a stack of letters onto the fire. As he adds more from his box, his dark-haired buddy walks up. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS468
01:08:26,00 --> 01:08:35,50
Clenching his jaw, SOMEONE<John> shakes his head, as he continues to toss letters into the flames. His friend eyes him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS470
01:08:43,00 --> 01:08:50,50
SOMEONE<John> dumps the remainder of the box into the trash can. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS471
01:09:22,00 --> 01:09:27,50
He heads off, leaving SOMEONE<John> staring at the fire. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS472
01:09:25,00 --> 01:09:32,50
Later, a convoy of military vehicles trundles down a dirt road. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS473
01:09:29,00 --> 01:09:38,50
Dust churns from their wheels. A Humvee passes a man leading a camel and maneuvers unto a busier road. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS474
01:09:35,00 --> 01:09:39,50
SOMEONE<John> rides inside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS475
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:09,50
A man runs in front of their Humvee with his arms raised over his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS476
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:17,50
The Humvee stops, and the soldiers climb out with their guns drawn. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS477
01:10:29,00 --> 01:10:33,50
SOMEONE<John> heads away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS478
01:10:37,00 --> 01:10:45,50
SOMEONE's<John's> dark-haired friend joins him. With their guns at the ready, they creep around the parameter of a decrepit factory. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS479
01:10:44,00 --> 01:10:55,50
The captain gestures to the rest of the team. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<John> and Noodles round the corner of a deteriorating cement wall. Noodles glances at SOMEONE<John>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS480
01:10:57,00 --> 01:11:05,50
A man on a balcony shoots Noodles. SOMEONE<John> fires back, then talks into his radio. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS481
01:11:03,00 --> 01:11:12,50
He grabs Noodles by the vest and drags him out of harm’s way. Then inspects the soldier's chest. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS482
01:11:14,00 --> 01:11:19,50
SOMEONE<John> extracts a bullet from Noodles' tactical vest. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS483
01:11:22,00 --> 01:11:28,50
As SOMEONE<John> helps Noodles stand, four bullets rip through him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS484
01:11:26,00 --> 01:11:31,50
SOMEONE<John> falls back in slow motion. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS485
01:11:30,00 --> 01:11:35,50
Soldiers fire at his shooter, who collapses. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS486
01:11:35,00 --> 01:11:41,50
Kneeling beside SOMEONE<John>, Noodles props him against a wall. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS487
01:11:44,00 --> 01:11:48,50
SOMEONE's<John's> vision blurs. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS488
01:11:49,00 --> 01:11:54,50
SOMEONE<John> glances drowsily at Noodles. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS489
01:11:54,00 --> 01:11:58,50
He gently slaps SOMEONE's<John's> cheek. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS490
01:11:59,00 --> 01:12:05,50
Our view of the soldiers tilts upside down, then drifts to the ground. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS492
01:12:05,00 --> 01:12:12,50
Now pale light shines through Venetian blinds, as SOMEONE<John> lies in a bed. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS493
01:12:09,00 --> 01:12:16,50
A hand adjusts the slats on the blinds and bright sunlight pours into the room. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS494
01:12:14,00 --> 01:12:21,50
SOMEONE's<John's> head shifts, and his hazy vision finds a nurse at his bedside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS495
01:12:18,00 --> 01:12:23,50
She smiles down at the groggy soldier. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS496
01:12:29,00 --> 01:12:37,50
As helooks at the nurse's kind expression, SOMEONE's vision gets blurrier, and he closes his eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS497
01:12:34,00 --> 01:12:38,50
Fade to black. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS498
01:12:39,00 --> 01:12:50,50
Now, SOMEONE<John> sits on the side of his bed, with his arm in a sling. Struggling, he manages to lift the strap over his head. He drops the sling on the floor. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS499
01:12:49,00 --> 01:12:57,50
Eyeing his reflection in a mirror, he unsnaps the top of his hospital gown, to reveal his bandaged shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS500
01:12:54,00 --> 01:13:00,50
He winces as he tears the tape and gauze from his skin. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS502
01:13:02,00 --> 01:13:11,50
As SOMEONE<John> slips one arm into a t-shirt, sunlight gleams on the scarred flesh of two bullet wounds on his back. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS503
01:13:09,00 --> 01:13:19,50
Later, he straightens the collar of his army fatigues. Standing in front of the mirror in his uniform, he pulls his belt tight around his waist. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS504
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:24,50
Now, he enters a military building, and turns down a hallway. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS505
01:13:23,00 --> 01:13:29,50
He finds the captain writing at a desk in his office. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS506
01:13:27,00 --> 01:13:32,50
The captain looks up, as SOMEONE<John> walks in. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS507
01:13:51,00 --> 01:13:55,50
SOMEONE<John> doesn't budge. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS508
01:13:56,00 --> 01:14:02,50
He sullenly lowers himself into a chair, across from the captain. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS509
01:14:12,00 --> 01:14:16,50
The captain grins. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS510
01:14:35,00 --> 01:14:39,50
SOMEONE<John> holds the captain's gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS511
01:14:37,00 --> 01:14:42,50
Now, a helicopter sweeps over a desert. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS512
01:14:42,00 --> 01:14:48,50
Inside, SOMEONE<John> shifts his gaze away from the open side door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS513
01:14:46,00 --> 01:14:54,50
Now, a smoke grenade billows on an Afghan street, as soldier’s race across it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS514
01:14:52,00 --> 01:14:57,50
SOMEONE<John> searches an abandon building, his gun drawn. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS515
01:14:56,00 --> 01:15:02,50
Outside of a village, three explosions burst from the ground. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS516
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:05,50
SOMEONE<John> leads a group of soldiers down a rocky hill. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS517
01:15:05,00 --> 01:15:10,50
He directs his team as they race away from a hut. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS518
01:15:09,00 --> 01:15:15,50
It explodes and flames shoot into the sky. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS519
01:15:12,00 --> 01:15:18,50
Now, words appear. Special forces base, Qatar. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS521
01:15:17,00 --> 01:15:22,50
SOMEONE<John> strolls into his room, and reclines on his bed. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS522
01:15:25,00 --> 01:15:30,50
A soldier stops in the doorway. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS523
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:34,50
SOMEONE<John> sits up with an alarmed look. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS524
01:15:34,00 --> 01:15:39,50
He lowers his gaze from the soldier. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS525
01:15:36,00 --> 01:15:44,50
Now, he stares out an airplane window. His eyes narrowing as sunlight rises across his face. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS526
01:15:42,00 --> 01:15:49,50
Later in a hospital hallway, SOMEONE<John> watches his father through a window. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS527
01:15:46,00 --> 01:15:52,50
Tubes trail from Mr. SOMEONE's<Tyree's> mouth to a nearby ventilator. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS528
01:15:50,00 --> 01:15:54,50
A doctor stops beside SOMEONE<John>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS529
01:16:17,00 --> 01:16:22,50
SOMEONE<John> bows his head slightly and nods. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS531
01:16:22,00 --> 01:16:30,50
Wearing his army uniform, and carrying two bags, SOMEONE<John> mounts the steps to his dad's house. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS532
01:16:28,00 --> 01:16:34,50
He sets one bag down, opens the screen door and heads inside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS533
01:16:32,00 --> 01:16:37,50
Dim light bathes his face as he steps into the kitchen. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS534
01:16:35,00 --> 01:16:42,50
Dirty dishes, bottles, and jars clutter the counter top and stove. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS535
01:16:39,00 --> 01:16:45,50
SOMEONE's<John's> haunted stare holds steady on the mess. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS537
01:16:44,00 --> 01:16:52,50
He treads down a hall to his father's shadowy study, and lingers in the doorway. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS538
01:16:51,00 --> 01:16:59,50
Now, he pulls open a drawer and finds a jumble of dozens of coins in small boxes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS539
01:16:57,00 --> 01:17:02,50
He takes out a blue velvet box and opens it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS540
01:16:59,00 --> 01:17:06,50
With a sober stare, he turns over the Jefferson Mule in his fingers. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS541
01:17:04,00 --> 01:17:08,50
Seated at his father's desk. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS542
01:17:05,00 --> 01:17:11,50
He lifts his head and gazes out a window. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS543
01:17:10,00 --> 01:17:16,50
SOMEONE<John> sets the coin aside, and takes out a blank sheet of paper. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS544
01:17:14,00 --> 01:17:22,50
He lays it on the desk, then takes a pen from a holder and writes the word, Dear in the upper left hand corner. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS545
01:17:20,00 --> 01:17:28,50
Now in the hospital, SOMEONE<John> strides up to his father's room. But finds his bed empty. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS546
01:17:25,00 --> 01:17:30,50
He glances around, uneasily. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS547
01:17:31,00 --> 01:17:36,50
Doctors and nurses bustle past. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS548
01:17:33,00 --> 01:17:42,50
His brow furrowed, SOMEONE<John> spots a cot in the corridor, and strides toward it to find his father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS549
01:17:39,00 --> 01:17:46,50
The ailing man wears an oxygen mask. An IV bag hangs above his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS550
01:17:51,00 --> 01:17:56,50
A doctor reading a file, continues on her way. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS551
01:17:57,00 --> 01:18:02,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> gives a weary blink. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS552
01:17:59,00 --> 01:18:04,50
SOMEONE<John> stares at him uncomfortably. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS553
01:18:03,00 --> 01:18:08,50
He takes an envelope from his back pocket. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS555
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:18,50
Glides his finger along its edge, then reluctantly hands it to his father. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS556
01:18:15,00 --> 01:18:20,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> lifts the flap. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS559
01:18:23,00 --> 01:18:32,50
With palsied hands, Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> closes the envelope’s flap, and tucks the letter against the side of his body. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS560
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:33,50
SOMEONE<John> sways awkwardly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS561
01:18:37,00 --> 01:18:42,50
He scoots a wheeled stool over, and takes a seat. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS562
01:18:39,00 --> 01:18:46,50
As doctors and nurses stride past, he slides the letter out of the envelope. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS563
01:18:49,00 --> 01:18:54,50
His father watches through heavy lidded eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS564
01:19:41,00 --> 01:19:47,50
His ailing father offers a series of slow nods. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS565
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:33,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> gazes at his son tenderly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS566
01:20:30,00 --> 01:20:36,50
His right hand trembles against his chest. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS567
01:20:48,00 --> 01:20:55,50
SOMEONE's<John's> smoothly shaven jaw quivers as his eyes remain locked on his letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS568
01:20:52,00 --> 01:20:57,50
He resolutely shakes his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS569
01:21:02,00 --> 01:21:09,50
His father limply raises one hand and rests it against SOMEONE's<John's> shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS570
01:21:06,00 --> 01:21:14,50
As it slides off, SOMEONE<John> catches it, and lovingly touches his chin to his father's frail fingers. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS571
01:21:17,00 --> 01:21:24,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> pulls his hand away and places his palm against SOMEONE's<John's> cheek. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS572
01:21:21,00 --> 01:21:26,50
SOMEONE<John> holds it in place with his own hand. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS573
01:21:25,00 --> 01:21:31,50
Sliding his father's hand to cup the back of his neck. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS574
01:21:28,00 --> 01:21:35,50
SOMEONE<John> hunches down and hides his face in the crook of the man's frail arm. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS575
01:21:32,00 --> 01:21:38,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Tyree> raises his other hand to his son. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS576
01:21:38,00 --> 01:21:42,50
The soldier lifts his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS577
01:21:39,00 --> 01:21:44,50
And his father strokes his short hair. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS578
01:21:42,00 --> 01:21:50,50
SOMEONE<John> gently collapses unto the man's chest. And the coin collector cradles him as best he can. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS579
01:21:49,00 --> 01:21:55,50
Now, as misty rain pours down on an otherwise empty beach. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS580
01:21:52,00 --> 01:21:59,50
SOMEONE<John> sits beside his surfboard with his knees pulled up, and his head bowed. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS582
01:21:59,00 --> 01:22:06,50
Later, lying belly down on his surfboard, he paddles out in the steel gray sea. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS583
01:22:04,00 --> 01:22:10,50
Cloudy rain sheets down, as the waves buck and toss beneath him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS584
01:22:08,00 --> 01:22:15,50
He swings his legs into the water, and drops his unhooked ankle leash onto his board. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS585
01:22:13,00 --> 01:22:17,50
Releasing his grip on the board. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS586
01:22:14,00 --> 01:22:19,50
He lets himself drift away from it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS587
01:22:17,00 --> 01:22:21,50
As he floats on his back, 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS588
01:22:18,00 --> 01:22:23,50
a foamy wave breaks nearby. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS589
01:22:20,00 --> 01:22:26,50
Water laps at his face, and flows over his mouth. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS590
01:22:24,00 --> 01:22:32,50
His head sinks beneath the surface and he vanishes. His board gently bobs on the waves. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS591
01:22:29,00 --> 01:22:37,50
A few feet under water, SOMEONE<John> hovers vertically. His arms raised limply over his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS592
01:22:34,00 --> 01:22:40,50
Bubbles stream out of his mouth, as he tips his head back. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS593
01:22:38,00 --> 01:22:49,50
Later, still submerged, the grieving son buries his face in his hands. Then runs his fingers back into his hair, and covers his eyes with his palms. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS595
01:22:48,00 --> 01:22:55,50
SOMEONE<John> sits alone in a vacant church. A coffin stands in front of the alter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS596
01:22:52,00 --> 01:22:56,50
A pastor creeps in. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS597
01:23:02,00 --> 01:23:07,50
The pastor nods, sympathetically. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS598
01:23:04,00 --> 01:23:10,50
Then glances at the coffin and paces out. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS599
01:23:07,00 --> 01:23:14,50
Wearing his dress uniform, SOMEONE<John> stares off beneath his knitted brow. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS600
01:23:12,00 --> 01:23:17,50
His gaze shifts and he blinks sadly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS601
01:23:15,00 --> 01:23:22,50
The pastor disappears through a doorway, leaving SOMEONE<John> alone once again. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS602
01:23:19,00 --> 01:23:26,50
Now, the soldier drives his car with a stoic frown. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS603
01:23:23,00 --> 01:23:29,50
The images of passing trees reflect faintly on his windshield. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS604
01:23:27,00 --> 01:23:36,50
The car pulls through the gate of SOMEONE's<Savannah's> family home. And follows the winding drive around a knarled tree. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS605
01:23:33,00 --> 01:23:40,50
Slowing, the car pulls up alongside the corral beside the modest stables. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS606
01:23:38,00 --> 01:23:45,50
Inside, SOMEONE's<Savannah's> slender long-legged silhouette stands, petting a horse. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS607
01:23:42,00 --> 01:23:48,50
SOMEONE<John> stops the car and takes out his keys. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS608
01:23:45,00 --> 01:23:51,50
Her features lost in shadows, SOMEONE<Savannah> looks toward him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS609
01:23:48,00 --> 01:23:55,50
SOMEONE<John> gets out and faces the stables. Nervously pursing his lips. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS610
01:23:52,00 --> 01:23:57,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> quickly locks the horse into its stall. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS611
01:23:58,00 --> 01:24:06,50
Her form still silhouetted against the stables rear open doorway. SOMEONE<Savannah> treads towards SOMEONE<John>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS612
01:24:03,00 --> 01:24:08,50
He moves across the corral. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS613
01:24:05,00 --> 01:24:12,50
His mouth twitches uneasily above his neatly pressed uniform shirt. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS614
01:24:09,00 --> 01:24:17,50
The shadows hiding SOMEONE's<Savannah's> face fade, as she steps outside into the gentle sunlight. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS615
01:24:14,00 --> 01:24:20,50
It bathes her doe-like eyes and rosy cheeks. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS616
01:24:17,00 --> 01:24:22,50
SOMEONE<John> moves faster. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS617
01:24:19,00 --> 01:24:26,50
A pain smile fades from his former lover's rosebud lips. She halts. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS618
01:24:24,00 --> 01:24:30,50
SOMEONE<John> continues toward her, then stops a few yards away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS619
01:24:27,00 --> 01:24:37,50
SOMEONE's<Savannah's> corn silk hair lies captured in a tight braid, and she wears slim-fitting breaches and riding boots. She allows a smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS620
01:24:39,00 --> 01:24:46,50
A brief grin flickers over the corner of his mouth, as he stares at SOMEONE<Savannah> intensely. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS621
01:24:44,00 --> 01:24:49,50
Gazing back at him, she summons a deep breath. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS622
01:24:47,00 --> 01:24:54,50
SOMEONE<John> uncomfortably shoves a hand into his pocket. His lips parting sadly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS623
01:25:05,00 --> 01:25:12,50
SOMEONE<John> swallows, dropping his gaze, then shakes his head and locks eyes with SOMEONE<Savannah>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS624
01:25:10,00 --> 01:25:14,50
Her jaw drops. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS625
01:25:13,00 --> 01:25:18,50
She clutches both hands to her mouth and arches her brow. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS626
01:25:34,00 --> 01:25:39,50
She studies SOMEONE<John> sympathetically. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS627
01:25:36,00 --> 01:25:42,50
He bows his head and shifts awkwardly from foot to foot. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS628
01:25:47,00 --> 01:25:52,50
He reads a sign above the barn door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS629
01:26:07,00 --> 01:26:12,50
She forces a smile and gives a high shrug. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS630
01:26:12,00 --> 01:26:19,50
SOMEONE<John> lowers his stare and swallows. Swaying on his feet. Then looks back up at her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS631
01:26:16,00 --> 01:26:22,50
She tearfully meets his gaze before glancing away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS632
01:26:26,00 --> 01:26:30,50
SOMEONE<John> offers a faint nod. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS633
01:26:27,00 --> 01:26:32,50
Later in SOMEONE's<Savannah's> dining room. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS634
01:26:35,00 --> 01:26:41,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> nods, then sorrowfully shakes her head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS635
01:26:38,00 --> 01:26:43,50
SOMEONE<John> stares down at the table. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS636
01:26:54,00 --> 01:26:59,50
Smiling, SOMEONE<John> drops his gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS637
01:27:00,00 --> 01:27:05,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> offers a candid grin. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS638
01:27:02,00 --> 01:27:06,50
SOMEONE<John> nods. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS639
01:27:07,00 --> 01:27:12,50
She hurries away, and he idly looks around. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS640
01:27:17,00 --> 01:27:23,50
The soldier gets up and ambles towards a mantle. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS641
01:27:20,00 --> 01:27:25,50
Where several framed photographs stand. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS642
01:27:22,00 --> 01:27:27,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> glances at him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS643
01:27:28,00 --> 01:27:32,50
She presses her lips together. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS644
01:27:33,00 --> 01:27:38,50
One photograph shows SOMEONE<Savannah> in a wedding dress. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS645
01:27:37,00 --> 01:27:42,50
She poses with SOMEONE<Tim>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS646
01:27:45,00 --> 01:27:51,50
SOMEONE<John> stares at the wedding photo. His brow knit. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS647
01:27:48,00 --> 01:27:53,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> summons a breath and eyes him uneasily. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS648
01:27:56,00 --> 01:28:01,50
SOMEONE<John> swallows hard. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS649
01:28:01,00 --> 01:28:07,50
In the photo, SOMEONE<Savannah> beams beside her bearded groom. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS650
01:28:04,00 --> 01:28:10,50
Later, SOMEONE<John> and SOMEONE<Savannah> stroll through a sunny park. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS651
01:28:27,00 --> 01:28:32,50
Later in a hospital, they head into an atrium. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS652
01:28:36,00 --> 01:28:42,50
They find a beardless SOMEONE<Tim> sitting in a wheelchair. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS653
01:28:39,00 --> 01:28:43,50
He musters a smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS654
01:28:40,00 --> 01:28:45,50
A teenage SOMEONE<Alan> jogs up. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS655
01:28:51,00 --> 01:28:55,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> faces her husband. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS656
01:28:54,00 --> 01:28:58,50
She kisses him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS657
01:29:04,00 --> 01:29:08,50
SOMEONE<Alan> skips off after SOMEONE<Savannah>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS658
01:29:06,00 --> 01:29:12,50
SOMEONE<John> stands awkwardly in front of the cancer patient. Clasping his hands. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS659
01:29:15,00 --> 01:29:21,50
SOMEONE<John> takes a seat and the ailing father studies him wryly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS660
01:29:25,00 --> 01:29:29,50
Nodding, the two men lock gazes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS661
01:29:27,00 --> 01:29:31,50
SOMEONE<Tim> earnestly lifts his brow. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS662
01:29:30,00 --> 01:29:34,50
SOMEONE<John> drops his eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS663
01:29:43,00 --> 01:29:48,50
SOMEONE<Tim> gives a long weary blink. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS664
01:30:05,00 --> 01:30:11,50
The soldier's gaze drifts thoughtfully. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS665
01:30:10,00 --> 01:30:15,50
SOMEONE<Tim> stares off. His eyes bleary. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS666
01:30:13,00 --> 01:30:19,50
SOMEONE<John> tucks his lips into his mouth and bites them gently. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS667
01:30:16,00 --> 01:30:23,50
SOMEONE<Tim> watches SOMEONE<Savannah> as she stands with SOMEONE<Alan> at a snack kiosk. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS668
01:30:30,00 --> 01:30:35,50
SOMEONE<John> bows his head, avoiding SOMEONE's<Tim's> gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS669
01:30:38,00 --> 01:30:44,50
The patient's lips twitch into a wincing smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS670
01:30:41,00 --> 01:30:46,50
SOMEONE's<John's> eyes remain downcast. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS671
01:30:44,00 --> 01:30:50,50
He lifts his head and glances at SOMEONE<Tim>, blinking pensively. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS672
01:30:48,00 --> 01:30:55,50
Later, SOMEONE's<Savannah's> SUV parks in front of her plantation style home. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS673
01:30:52,00 --> 01:30:57,50
SOMEONE<Alan> gets out and races away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS674
01:30:57,00 --> 01:31:04,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> and SOMEONE<John> linger in the vehicle. Their seat-belts fastened. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS675
01:31:05,00 --> 01:31:09,50
SOMEONE<John> unbuckles. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS676
01:31:06,00 --> 01:31:11,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> shakes her head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS677
01:31:44,00 --> 01:31:49,50
Staring off despondently. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS678
01:31:46,00 --> 01:31:53,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> tightens her rosebud lips, then locks eyes with her former lover. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS679
01:31:55,00 --> 01:32:00,50
SOMEONE<John> manages a smile and looks away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS681
01:31:58,00 --> 01:32:04,50
In a dining room, SOMEONE<Savannah> pours herself a glass of wine. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS682
01:32:01,00 --> 01:32:05,50
SOMEONE<John> glowers. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS683
01:32:10,00 --> 01:32:14,50
She uncomfortably shifts her gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS684
01:32:12,00 --> 01:32:19,50
As SOMEONE<John> studies her inscrutably out of the corner of his eye, she rubs her lips together. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS685
01:32:32,00 --> 01:32:38,50
Her wounded smile fades, and she looks to the ceiling. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS686
01:32:40,00 --> 01:32:46,50
SOMEONE<John> taps his fork against his plate and sets it down. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS687
01:32:52,00 --> 01:32:58,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> stares with doe-like eyes, then lowers her dark lashes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS688
01:33:04,00 --> 01:33:09,50
SOMEONE<John> glares, shifting his jaw. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS689
01:33:06,00 --> 01:33:10,50
His mouth opens as if to speak. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS690
01:33:08,00 --> 01:33:12,50
But he shuts it and looks away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS691
01:33:09,00 --> 01:33:13,50
He shakes his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS692
01:33:12,00 --> 01:33:17,50
His intense gaze grows tearful. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS693
01:33:37,00 --> 01:33:41,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> hangs her head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS694
01:33:39,00 --> 01:33:43,50
Bobbing it equivocatingly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS695
01:33:40,00 --> 01:33:44,50
She stares at the table. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS696
01:33:53,00 --> 01:33:57,50
She looks up imploringly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS697
01:34:02,00 --> 01:34:06,50
SOMEONE<John> gapes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS698
01:34:03,00 --> 01:34:10,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> rises and starts out of the room, then whirls around. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS699
01:34:54,00 --> 01:34:59,50
SOMEONE<John> pulls her into his arms. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS700
01:34:56,00 --> 01:35:01,50
She buries her face against his chest. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS701
01:35:03,00 --> 01:35:09,50
Cupping SOMEONE's<Savannah's> head in his hand, he gently rocks her back and forth. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS702
01:35:07,00 --> 01:35:11,50
Later in the sitting room. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS703
01:35:08,00 --> 01:35:14,50
She removes a rubber band from a stack of SOMEONE's<John's> letters. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS704
01:35:11,00 --> 01:35:15,50
He takes an envelope. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS705
01:35:21,00 --> 01:35:26,50
SOMEONE<John> slides out the letter inside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS706
01:35:33,00 --> 01:35:38,50
It reads, I love you, SOMEONE<John>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS707
01:35:36,00 --> 01:35:43,50
As she reaches for the stack of letters, she knocks over a glass of wine. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS708
01:35:44,00 --> 01:35:49,50
Liquid drips from SOMEONE's<Savannah's> sleeve. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS709
01:35:50,00 --> 01:35:56,50
SOMEONE<John> unbuttons his wet sleeve as he heads into a bathroom. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS710
01:35:57,00 --> 01:36:04,50
Behind him, SOMEONE<Savannah> stands just inside a bedroom with a door half open. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS711
01:36:01,00 --> 01:36:05,50
She removes her blouse. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS712
01:36:02,00 --> 01:36:10,50
As SOMEONE<John> scrubs his sleeve, he glimpses a reflection of her bare back in the bathroom mirror. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS713
01:36:07,00 --> 01:36:12,50
He eyes her longingly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS714
01:36:09,00 --> 01:36:16,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> brushes her hair back and turns, catching SOMEONE's<John's> gaze in the mirror. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS715
01:36:13,00 --> 01:36:18,50
The former lovers lock eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS716
01:36:15,00 --> 01:36:23,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> turns away pulls a flannel shirt over her shoulders. SOMEONE<John> bows his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS717
01:36:20,00 --> 01:36:25,50
Now they head downstairs. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS718
01:36:26,00 --> 01:36:32,50
She heads into the kitchen, but SOMEONE<John> strides past the doorway. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS719
01:36:29,00 --> 01:36:36,50
She glances back at him, then leans heavily on a counter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS720
01:36:33,00 --> 01:36:40,50
In the hall, SOMEONE<John> shifts his weight uneasily, then treads toward the kitchen. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS721
01:36:37,00 --> 01:36:46,50
As SOMEONE<Savannah> turns to face him, he halts in the doorway and stares at her resolutely. One hand shoved in his pocket. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS722
01:36:44,00 --> 01:36:49,50
She tearfully locks eyes with him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS723
01:36:49,00 --> 01:36:53,50
Clenching his jaw. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS724
01:36:50,00 --> 01:36:57,50
He holds SOMEONE's<Savannah's> gaze. Then turns from the doorway and strides off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS725
01:36:55,00 --> 01:37:02,50
He walks into the dining room, and retrieves his jacket from the back of his chair. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS726
01:37:00,00 --> 01:37:06,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> joins him, her dark-lashed eyes blinking forlornly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS727
01:37:06,00 --> 01:37:11,50
She looks to SOMEONE<John>, then shyly shifts her gaze. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS728
01:37:09,00 --> 01:37:14,50
He grinds his jaw as he watches her. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS729
01:37:11,00 --> 01:37:15,50
She beams at him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS730
01:37:14,00 --> 01:37:18,50
SOMEONE<John> looks away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS731
01:37:22,00 --> 01:37:27,50
His gaze downcast, he backs away. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS732
01:37:24,00 --> 01:37:29,50
Then heads to the front door. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS733
01:37:28,00 --> 01:37:31,50
He halts. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS734
01:37:29,00 --> 01:37:33,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> stares at the floor. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS735
01:37:33,00 --> 01:37:39,50
She takes a few steps toward him and raises her tearful eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS736
01:37:36,00 --> 01:37:44,50
As SOMEONE<John> turns, she lifts her brow expectantly and offers a faint smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS737
01:37:41,00 --> 01:37:46,50
He meets her pleading stare, then bows his head. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS739
01:37:46,00 --> 01:37:51,50
He opens the screen door and steps outside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS740
01:37:49,00 --> 01:37:55,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> swallows, cringing as tears well in her eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS741
01:37:52,00 --> 01:37:57,50
She shakes her head disbelievingly. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS742
01:37:55,00 --> 01:38:02,50
Outside, SOMEONE<John> trudges to his car. His jacket slung over his shoulder. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS743
01:37:59,00 --> 01:38:05,50
Inside, tears stream down SOMEONE's<Savannah's> face. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS745
01:38:07,00 --> 01:38:12,50
SOMEONE's<John's> car trundles down the driveway. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS746
01:38:10,00 --> 01:38:15,50
Inside, SOMEONE<John> rests his head against his hand. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS747
01:38:13,00 --> 01:38:17,50
Tears shine on his face. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS748
01:38:17,00 --> 01:38:22,50
His face seizes. His chin trembling. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS749
01:38:19,00 --> 01:38:25,50
He rubs his brow, then pounds his hand on the steering wheel. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS751
01:38:25,00 --> 01:38:32,50
He accidentally turns on his wipers and they glide across the windshield. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS752
01:38:29,00 --> 01:38:33,50
He flips them off. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS753
01:38:31,00 --> 01:38:38,50
Later at his house, he stands in his father's study with his hands in his pockets. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS754
01:38:35,00 --> 01:38:43,50
He thoughtfully eyes the boxes of coins stored under a glass counter. Then pulls them out. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS755
01:38:41,00 --> 01:38:46,50
Now at the Honest Coin dealer shop. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS756
01:39:13,00 --> 01:39:19,50
Outside, SOMEONE<John> opens his trunk to reveal the collection. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS757
01:39:33,00 --> 01:39:40,50
Now in a desert, SOMEONE<John> holds out his Jefferson Mule. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS758
01:39:42,00 --> 01:39:48,50
SOMEONE<John> flips the coin into the sand. The soldier inspects it. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS759
01:39:49,00 --> 01:39:54,50
As SOMEONE<John> leads the group, a soldier approaches him. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS760
01:39:53,00 --> 01:39:57,50
He hands over an envelope. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS761
01:39:56,00 --> 01:40:00,50
SOMEONE<John> studies the envelope. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS762
01:39:57,00 --> 01:40:04,50
Later, soldiers load cargo into vehicles as SOMEONE<John> reads his letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS763
01:40:30,00 --> 01:40:36,50
In a flashback, guests greet SOMEONE<Tim> at a casual party. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS764
01:40:34,00 --> 01:40:39,50
He laughs with SOMEONE<Alan>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS765
01:40:42,00 --> 01:40:48,50
In another flashback, SOMEONE<Savannah> writes the letter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS766
01:40:57,00 --> 01:41:04,50
Nighttime, SOMEONE<Savannah> stands on her porch and gazes into the sky. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS767
01:41:08,00 --> 01:41:14,50
Tears glisten in her eyes as she stares at the moon. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS768
01:41:18,00 --> 01:41:24,50
Now, SOMEONE<John> wheels a bike down a busy street. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS769
01:41:23,00 --> 01:41:29,50
He wears a button down shirt and a neatly trimmed goatee. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS770
01:41:26,00 --> 01:41:33,50
A view through a cafe window shows SOMEONE<Savannah> seated at a table by herself. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS771
01:41:31,00 --> 01:41:38,50
SOMEONE's<John's> reflection appears on an adjoining window, as he bends to lock his bike to a parking meter. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS772
01:41:36,00 --> 01:41:41,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Savannah> notices SOMEONE<John>. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS773
01:41:38,00 --> 01:41:43,50
Noticing her, he does a double take, 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS774
01:41:40,00 --> 01:41:44,50
and they share a smile. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS775
01:41:46,00 --> 01:41:51,50
SOMEONE<Savannah> rises and heads outside. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS776
01:41:49,00 --> 01:41:54,50
Grinning, she wraps her arms around SOMEONE's<John's> neck. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS777
01:41:51,00 --> 01:41:56,50
And blissfully closes her eyes. 

DEAR_JOHN_DVS778
01:41:53,00 --> 01:41:59,50
SOMEONE<John> holds her tightly. His face buried against her shoulder.
