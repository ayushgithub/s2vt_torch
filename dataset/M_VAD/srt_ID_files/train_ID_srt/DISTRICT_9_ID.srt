DISTRICT_9_DVS87
00:10:16,00 --> 00:10:34,50
Now from a helicopter we gaze over a soldier's rifle at the convoy of MNU trucks. Words appear - 12 kilometers to District 9. 8:48 AM. In one of the trucks, the mercenaries raise masks over their mouths and prepare their weapons.

In the slum, an alien clubs an unseen figure on the ground. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS97
00:11:54,00 --> 00:12:03,50
Looks on, dangling from its mouth. By a shack, a rifle-wielding alien wears a helmet with SOMEONE<Wikus>.

00:14:28,00 --> 00:14:33,50
The alien obeys, and SOMEONE<Wikus> sets the can down.

00:14:32,00 --> 00:14:40,50
The can, the alien crams it in his molar. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS124
00:14:40,00 --> 00:14:49,50

DISTRICT_9_DVS155
00:18:02,00 --> 00:18:14,50
Alien vomits at their feet. Now they approach another. They find an alien gun under some weeds. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS157
00:18:17,00 --> 00:18:31,50
An agent inventories the contraband. Now a human boy speaks. Some of the guns are small, but if it shoot you, it make a big mess. Now an armed alien fires an alien rifle. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS160
00:19:01,00 --> 00:19:05,50
Alien graffiti. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS162
00:19:10,00 --> 00:19:15,50
Now an alien in a pink bra

Helicopter, the sniper fires warning shots in the air. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS166
00:19:30,00 --> 00:19:35,50
The helicopter flies off. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS168
00:19:39,00 --> 00:19:48,50
Wearing a vest, searches through a trash pile, tossing aside unwanted items. A child-sized alien scavenges nearby. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS169
00:19:48,00 --> 00:19:57,50
As the vest-clad alien crosses to another pile, a yellow patterned alien adult holds up a piece of trash. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS170
00:19:56,00 --> 00:20:00,50
The first alien rises. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS174
00:20:12,00 --> 00:20:17,50
The little alien approaches him with a canister.  

DISTRICT_9_DVS176
00:20:20,00 --> 00:20:24,50
The vest-clad alien taps the youngster on the head. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS177
00:20:32,00 --> 00:20:40,50
Now inside their shack, the two adult aliens mix a concoction over a makeshift laboratory. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS181
00:20:52,00 --> 00:21:08,50
by tiny alligator clips holds a gelatinous puddle. From a pipette, a droplet falls onto the jelly which ripples and bubbles up. Another black drop falls through the mesh into a metallic canister, which electronically seals itself. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS183
00:21:15,00 --> 00:21:25,50
A helicopter view outside shows SOMEONE's<Wikus's> team approaching their shack.  

DISTRICT_9_DVS184
00:21:27,00 --> 00:21:31,50
Inside, the vest-clad alien takes out the canister and hands it to his partner. The yellow alien hands it back. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS185
00:21:32,00 --> 00:21:37,50
Clippings on the shack's wall. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS192
00:22:04,00 --> 00:22:12,50
Pointing his rifle, SOMEONE kicks open the door and the Yellow alien steps out 

DISTRICT_9_DVS199
00:22:43,00 --> 00:22:47,50
Sprangs the panel back with his baton. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS200
00:22:46,00 --> 00:22:50,50
That SOMEONE<will> reveal the alien lab. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS202
00:22:53,00 --> 00:22:58,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> rifles through cabinets. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS204
00:22:58,00 --> 00:23:03,50
Now he finds a rusty metal box. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS205
00:23:04,00 --> 00:23:09,50
The alien slender metallic canister inside. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS207
00:23:20,00 --> 00:23:32,50
Black fluid sprays him in the face. Gagging, SOMEONE<Wikus> hunches forward. He waves the camera and ran off, and takes out a tissue to wipe his face. He palms the camera. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS208
00:23:33,00 --> 00:23:37,50
When he appears cleaned-up, 

DISTRICT_9_DVS209
00:23:48,00 --> 00:23:52,50
he bags the canister. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS212
00:24:04,00 --> 00:24:11,50
Now SOMEONE<Wikus> leads SOMEONE<Fundiswa> into a room of weapons. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS215
00:24:24,00 --> 00:24:28,50
In the shack, SOMEONE<Wikus> studies an alien rifle. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS223
00:25:02,00 --> 00:25:09,50
An incoming chopper. The alien knocks SOMEONE's gun hits SOMEONE with it. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS224
00:25:10,00 --> 00:25:16,50
As the hiding alien watches, the helicopter descends. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS225
00:25:19,00 --> 00:25:23,50
Fires a shot into the alien's back. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS226
00:25:27,00 --> 00:25:32,50
Lies on the ground, riving.  

DISTRICT_9_DVS228
00:25:38,00 --> 00:25:44,50
SOMEONE<Fundiswa> helps SOMEONE<Wikus> sit up. SOMEONE<Wikus> backs the camera away. As the yellow alien crawl. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS230
00:25:49,00 --> 00:25:53,50
SOMEONE<Koobus> shoots it in the head. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS231
00:25:52,00 --> 00:25:58,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> and SOMEONE<Fundiswa> look on. The hiding alien backs around the corner. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS232
00:25:57,00 --> 00:26:02,50
The surviving alien moves off. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS238
00:26:29,00 --> 00:26:33,50
Now medics bandage SOMEONE's<Wikus's> arm. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS239
00:26:36,00 --> 00:26:45,50
Inside another shack, the little alien stands at a table where device displays a hologram of the solar system. His father enters. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS243
00:26:54,00 --> 00:27:00,50
Watch for humans. He opens the door for the little one to go out. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS244
00:27:00,00 --> 00:27:06,50
The child exits and the father shuts the door. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS246
00:27:16,00 --> 00:27:25,50
Outside their doorway, the little alien plays with an empty cat food can. The agents approach. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS249
00:27:44,00 --> 00:27:49,50
He throws the alien child a candy. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS250
00:27:48,00 --> 00:27:55,50
The child throws it back in his face. SOMEONE<Thomas> aims his shotgun at the kid. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS254
00:28:07,00 --> 00:28:11,50
Moves out and drops to his knees. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS261
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:43,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> confers with SOMEONE<Thomas> and SOMEONE<Fundiswa>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS265
00:29:10,00 --> 00:29:14,50
The alien blocks SOMEONE<Wikus> from approaching the shack. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS267
00:29:24,00 --> 00:29:29,50
He kneels at the door. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS268
00:29:28,00 --> 00:29:35,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> steps inside and finds the walls covered with computer parts. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS270
00:29:52,00 --> 00:29:59,50
The little alien hides under a table. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS272
00:30:02,00 --> 00:30:07,50
Looking queasy, SOMEONE<Wikus> runs out, outside. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS273
00:30:05,00 --> 00:30:14,50
The alien looks over. SOMEONE<Wikus> waves off SOMEONE<Fundiswa>, accidentally flinging puke. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS274
00:30:13,00 --> 00:30:25,50
Again, then braces himself on the shack. He faces his assistant. Embarrassed, SOMEONE<Wikus> backs the camera away. Now they rejoin SOMEONE<Thomas>. The alien, SOMEONE<Christopher> Johnson. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS276
00:30:32,00 --> 00:30:42,50
Now in the MNU transport, a piqued SOMEONE<Wikus> rubs his brow, seated opposite SOMEONE<Fundiswa> and SOMEONE<Thomas>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS279
00:30:48,00 --> 00:31:00,50
At a restaurant named Gunther's, workers serve up fish and chips. As SOMEONE<Wikus> eats happily, his nose leaks black fluid. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS281
00:31:12,00 --> 00:31:23,50
A droplet lands on his thumb. Startled, SOMEONE<Wikus> glances at his companions and wipes it with a napkin. Now, the truck enters the MNU facility. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS282
00:31:25,00 --> 00:31:34,50
In the headquarters, SOMEONE<Wikus> leans back in a cubicle holding his head. He coughs into a napkin, and starts filling out a form. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS283
00:31:37,00 --> 00:31:47,50
He flips to another page then stares at his fingernail. A security camera captures the moment. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS284
00:31:48,00 --> 00:31:55,50
As SOMEONE<Wikus> trembles, his fingernail comes off. He sets it down on the desk. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS285
00:31:53,00 --> 00:32:13,50
Now he crosses the office floor. He passes a co-worker at a water cooler and enters the bathroom. Inside, he scans the room. Then standing in front of a mirror, nips at his other fingernails. The first couple hold, but his thumbnail easily comes off. SOMEONE<Wikus> recoils. He spits out the thumbnail. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS287
00:32:21,00 --> 00:32:26,50
He and his child brood around. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS289
00:32:26,00 --> 00:32:31,50
Find it, it contains the fluid. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS290
00:32:30,00 --> 00:32:35,50
It’s not here. It has to be, keep looking. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS293
00:32:39,00 --> 00:32:44,50
Two aliens, one armed, stand in front of them. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS296
00:32:51,00 --> 00:32:55,50
While people watch, robot's chest opens  

DISTRICT_9_DVS298
00:33:01,00 --> 00:33:07,50
A thug hold up his index finger. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS305
00:33:39,00 --> 00:33:48,50
Two men unwrap an alien body part. You cut it here, this is the heart. It cures high blood pressure when you boil it. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS306
00:33:46,00 --> 00:33:51,50
Diabetes, all diseases. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS307
00:33:48,00 --> 00:33:54,50
The gang leader watches the witch raise an alien arm in a ritual. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS310
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:18,50
To the yard. Night time, SOMEONE<Wikus> drives in traffic. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS311
00:34:18,00 --> 00:34:29,50
Van De Merwe Residence, 8:22 PM. SOMEONE<Wikus> pulls into the driveway and gets out of the car. SOMEONE<Tania> greets him as he enters the darkened house. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS313
00:34:32,00 --> 00:34:39,50
The lights go on in the house. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS314
00:34:38,00 --> 00:34:44,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> faces SOMEONE<Tania>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS315
00:34:43,00 --> 00:34:47,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> hugs his parents. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS317
00:34:53,00 --> 00:34:59,50
SOMEONE<Tania> notices SOMEONE<his>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS323
00:35:31,00 --> 00:35:37,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> goes off. SOMEONE<Smit> faces SOMEONE's<Wikus's> parents. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS324
00:35:36,00 --> 00:35:40,50
SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE's cheek. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS327
00:35:47,00 --> 00:36:00,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> rises from the sink. Later he blows out candles on a cake. Pale and sickly, he briefly turns away from the surrounding guests, wipes his mouth then grabs a knife. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS329
00:36:01,00 --> 00:36:06,50
Cuts the cake, his eyes widen. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS330
00:36:09,00 --> 00:36:16,50
A sweaty SOMEONE<Wikus> cuts a small piece for his mother. He hold his hand to his mouth. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS331
00:36:17,00 --> 00:36:28,50
Black fluid across the cake and hors d'oeuvres. He grabs a napkin and starts to mop it up, but collapses onto the table and rolls to the floor. Cut to black. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS332
00:36:30,00 --> 00:36:42,50
Admission to a hospital, 10 PM. SOMEONE<Tania> sits in the waiting room. In an examination wing, a doctor snips the blood soaked bandage from SOMEONE's<Wikus's> left arm. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS335
00:37:10,00 --> 00:37:14,50
Now in the waiting room. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS336
00:37:15,00 --> 00:37:20,50
Masked guards storm past SOMEONE<Tania>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS338
00:37:20,00 --> 00:37:27,50
confused. In the exam area, they seize a struggling SOMEONE<Wikus>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS339
00:37:26,00 --> 00:37:31,50
Noticing the commotion across the room. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS340
00:37:32,00 --> 00:37:37,50
The guards zip SOMEONE<Wikus> into a body bag. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS345
00:37:59,00 --> 00:38:08,50
Stares upward under the body bag's clear front panel. Two doctors in coveralls wheel him down a corridor, then unzip the bag. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS346
00:38:09,00 --> 00:38:20,50
Outside the door, a guard peers through a small eye-level window. Later, doctors work on the ragged bleeding flesh of his mutating arm. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS347
00:38:25,00 --> 00:38:36,50
Wearing an oxygen mask, SOMEONE<Wikus> glances up. Doctors study x-rays. Another tech finds the confiscated alien canister in SOMEONE's<Wikus's> jacket. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS350
00:38:42,00 --> 00:38:56,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> peers at the canister, watching the doctors study it through the plastic bag. Later, two doctors host on SOMEONE<Wikus>, who's strapped to an exam table. Four security cameras show fast-motion footage of SOMEONE<Wikus> getting worked on. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS351
00:38:58,00 --> 00:39:03,50
16 hours after exposure. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS352
00:39:01,00 --> 00:39:08,50
A doctor wheels SOMEONE<Wikus> into a laboratory. They pass a tech stretching an alien 

DISTRICT_9_DVS353
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:14,50
membrane over his hands. Rows of stainless steel tables hold various alien body parts. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS354
00:39:13,00 --> 00:39:20,50
Later in a live recording, a doctor holds a surgical drill. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS355
00:39:20,00 --> 00:39:27,50
SOMEONE<Smit> and another man watch on a monitor as he drills into SOMEONE's<Wikus's> arm. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS358
00:39:37,00 --> 00:39:47,50
Now a doctor holds up a slate. He shows a machine gun-like alien weapon. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS359
00:39:45,00 --> 00:39:56,50
Two techs hurry from the opposite side of the room where a dead pig hangs upside down. The head doctor places SOMEONE's<Wikus's> alien hand on the gun. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS360
00:39:57,00 --> 00:40:02,50
They curl his tentacles through the handle. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS361
00:40:04,00 --> 00:40:08,50
The head doctor zaps SOMEONE's 

DISTRICT_9_DVS362
00:40:06,00 --> 00:40:10,50
arm with a cattle prod. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS363
00:40:09,00 --> 00:40:14,50
Bits of light burst from the gun as it fires into the pig. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS368
00:40:41,00 --> 00:40:45,50
The gun fires, blowing a hole in the wall. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS371
00:40:52,00 --> 00:40:55,50
Shoot from the weapon's barrel. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS372
00:40:57,00 --> 00:41:04,50
Setting off another weapon. The captive trembles and his eyes widen. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS374
00:41:08,00 --> 00:41:13,50
An alien marked with a red X to the wall. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS377
00:41:20,00 --> 00:41:25,50
SOMEONE's<Wikus’s> right hand around the gun. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS382
00:41:45,00 --> 00:41:50,50
The executive smiles at the monitors. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS383
00:41:49,00 --> 00:41:55,50
Streaked with the alien's blood, SOMEONE<Wikus> jerks back and forth numbly. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS384
00:41:56,00 --> 00:42:01,50
Stands over him in an operating room. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS385
00:42:22,00 --> 00:42:27,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> lies strapped to a table. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS386
00:42:56,00 --> 00:43:00,50
MNU executive nods. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS387
00:43:01,00 --> 00:43:14,50
The head doctor hurries off with the executive close behind. SOMEONE<Smit> glances down at his son-in-law's extended arm, then exits as well. Now at the Van De Merwe House, SOMEONE<Smit> pours two drinks. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS388
00:43:19,00 --> 00:43:24,50
SOMEONE<Tania> looks up tearfully from the couch. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS389
00:43:23,00 --> 00:43:27,50
He sits beside her. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS390
00:43:26,00 --> 00:43:32,50
Meanwhile, the head doctor talks into a camera. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS398
00:44:15,00 --> 00:44:19,50
into a surgical cart. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS399
00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:22,50
The doctor hits a large button on the wall. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS400
00:44:21,00 --> 00:44:26,50
Holds a scalpel to the head doctor's neck. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS401
00:44:25,00 --> 00:44:32,50
A guard rushes over, his gun pointed at SOMEONE<Wikus>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS404
00:44:35,00 --> 00:44:41,50
Lowers his gun, SOMEONE<Wikus> swipes an ID through a card reader. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS406
00:44:44,00 --> 00:44:50,50
Scampering down a hallway. He hurries up a flight of stairs and burst out 

DISTRICT_9_DVS407
00:44:47,00 --> 00:44:52,50
in the street. Back at the house, 

DISTRICT_9_DVS408
00:44:51,00 --> 00:44:58,50
SOMEONE's<Tania's> face crumples. SOMEONE<Smit> wraps an arm around her shoulders. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS409
00:45:02,00 --> 00:45:08,50
SOMEONE<Tania> watches her father rise from the couch and answer his phone. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS410
00:45:09,00 --> 00:45:15,50
Listens, his face slackens and his eyes widen. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS411
00:45:13,00 --> 00:45:18,50
He watches attentively. SOMEONE<Smit> glances back at her. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS412
00:45:26,00 --> 00:45:36,50
Prawn SOMEONE<Wikus> wears a hospital gown and scrub bottoms as he races over a hill beside the highway, and darts behind the backs of two guards. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS413
00:45:35,00 --> 00:45:41,50
Some garbage, finds a trash bag and eats a piece of thrown out food. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS414
00:45:41,00 --> 00:45:45,50
He sneaks up behind a pedestrian and snatches his phone. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS416
00:45:46,00 --> 00:45:52,50
His neighborhood. He hides behind a car, then cautiously peeks over 

DISTRICT_9_DVS417
00:45:52,00 --> 00:45:57,50
the guard patrolling his front yard. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS418
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:06,50
He makes a call. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS422
00:46:38,00 --> 00:46:44,50
The tall grass behind him, a German shepherd leads a group of soldiers. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS424
00:46:46,00 --> 00:46:52,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> steals garments off a clothesline. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS426
00:47:00,00 --> 00:47:10,50
Later, SOMEONE<Wikus> wears the stolen clothes with a blanket over them like a hooded cloak. A surveillance camera records him at the counter at Gunther's. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS430
00:47:27,00 --> 00:47:33,50
A Gunther's employee eyes SOMEONE<Wikus> nervously. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS433
00:47:46,00 --> 00:47:50,50
SOMEONE fights  

DISTRICT_9_DVS436
00:48:02,00 --> 00:48:08,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> stands on a hill, using the stolen phone. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS437
00:48:17,00 --> 00:48:22,50
He hangs up with a frustrated look. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS438
00:48:20,00 --> 00:48:31,50
He turns abruptly and lowers himself into the grass. An MNU vehicle pulls into a nearby clearing. It's blue and white lights flashing. A soldier steps out. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS439
00:48:34,00 --> 00:48:41,50
He sweeps his gaze over the area, then climbs back into his vehicle. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS440
00:48:40,00 --> 00:48:56,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> turns his head toward the sky, his eyes tracking the helicopter above, then looks back at the MNU vehicle. He ducks lower into the grass as the truck pulls out of the clearing. He stands, gazes out of the city, then hurries away. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS443
00:49:29,00 --> 00:49:57,50
Across the bleak grounds of District 9. He reaches a run-downed shack, peers through the window, then removes orange and white caution tape from across the door. With a glance at the dismal slum, he shuffles backward into the shanty. SOMEONE<Wikus> lies on the floor using a thin cushion of foam as a mattress, and pulls a wide sheet of cardboard over himself like a blanket. He settles newspaper around his alien arm, then lets his head fall back onto the foam. Morning. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS444
00:49:56,00 --> 00:50:01,50
Two aliens pick through the garbage. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS445
00:50:01,00 --> 00:50:08,50
A white hen and her chicks peck at the ground, while a rooster struts nearby. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS446
00:50:09,00 --> 00:50:14,50
40 hours after exposure. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS447
00:50:12,00 --> 00:50:20,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> jerks awake, glancing around with wide fearful eyes. Later, he squints as he snips a plastic container. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS448
00:50:18,00 --> 00:50:40,50
He finds a can of cat food and turns it upside down over his tilted back head. Milky white mush falls into his open mouth. Now, he exits the shack, his left arm hidden inside his coat. With his human arm, he lifts his collar to shield his face from nearby aliens. He stands in line at a meat seller's stall. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS450
00:50:53,00 --> 00:50:59,50
Meat seller smiles at his associates. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS453
00:51:15,00 --> 00:51:23,50
Sitting in the dirt, SOMEONE<Wikus> rips the lid off a can. Using two fingers, he shovels the moist cat food into his mouth. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS454
00:51:22,00 --> 00:51:30,50
His cheeks bulge as he chews hastily. He rocks forward and raises a shaking hand to his lips. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS455
00:51:33,00 --> 00:51:38,50
He chucks the can. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS456
00:51:36,00 --> 00:51:45,50
He spits something into his hand, then stares at it. Reaching into the back of his mouth, he rips out something else. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS457
00:51:45,00 --> 00:51:52,50
With a horrified look, he examines the two bloody molars in his hand. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS458
00:51:55,00 --> 00:51:59,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> takes out his phone. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS460
00:53:14,00 --> 00:53:18,50
Lowers the phone from his ear. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS461
00:53:22,00 --> 00:53:29,50
Now he races back to the meat seller's stall and steals an ax off a table. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS463
00:53:30,00 --> 00:53:45,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> races away and ducks behind some shrubbery. He drags a cinder block out of the rubble and sets it on the ground in front of him. Rolling up his sleeve, he places his alien arm on the block and raises the ax. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS464
00:53:45,00 --> 00:53:53,50
He lowers, adjusts his hand on the block, then determinedly raises the ax above his head. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS465
00:53:52,00 --> 00:53:58,50
His hand trembles as he grits his teeth and licks his lips. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS466
00:53:56,00 --> 00:54:02,50
He swings down the ax. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS467
00:54:01,00 --> 00:54:07,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> sits back and muffles his mouth with his human arm. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS468
00:54:07,00 --> 00:54:12,50
His attention drifts to the sky. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS469
00:54:11,00 --> 00:54:24,50
He stands and watches several helicopters approach. SOMEONE<Koobus> scans the area from one chopper. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS470
00:54:23,00 --> 00:54:34,50
A soldier cocks a machine gun aimed at the camp. On the ground, SOMEONE<Wikus> races through a trash laden area behind a roll of shacks. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS471
00:54:35,00 --> 00:54:46,50
As an MNU chopper passes overhead, he opens the door to one shanty and enters. Inside, SOMEONE<Christopher> Johnson looks up and sees him. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS472
00:54:45,00 --> 00:54:50,50
Subtitles. You, what do you want? 

DISTRICT_9_DVS473
00:54:49,00 --> 00:54:56,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> peers out a window at the retreating helicopters. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS474
00:55:00,00 --> 00:55:04,50
He leans toward SOMEONE's<Christopher's> son. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS478
00:55:24,00 --> 00:55:35,50
His eyes widen, as data appears on the multitude of computer monitors stacked around the room. His gaze follows their electrical cords through a hole in the floor. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS480
00:55:45,00 --> 00:55:58,50
He grabs the refugee with his alien hand, then collapses. SOMEONE's<Christopher's> antenna twitch as he stares at SOMEONE's<Wikus's> left arm. The alien nervously looks around, the tendrils on his mouth swinging back and forth. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS482
00:56:05,00 --> 00:56:10,50
Now you, get down there. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS483
00:56:11,00 --> 00:56:18,50
Now SOMEONE<Wikus> lie supine on the ground. He slowly wakes and sits up. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS484
00:56:18,00 --> 00:56:23,50
He presses his hand to his head. SOMEONE<Christopher> approaches. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS486
00:56:48,00 --> 00:57:04,50
SOMEONE<Christopher> stomps his foot and turns his back to SOMEONE<Wikus>. As the human stands, he surveys the tangles of wires crisscrossing out of electronics and over the walls. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS487
00:57:03,00 --> 00:57:14,50
SOMEONE<and> turns. You ruined everything. SOMEONE<Wikus> stares through a hatch in the ceiling, which leads to the hole in the shack's floor. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS488
00:57:30,00 --> 00:57:36,50
SOMEONE's<Christopher's> son points to a hole in a small metal tank. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS503
00:59:01,00 --> 00:59:13,50
SOMEONE's<Christopher's> son stands beside SOMEONE<Wikus>. He looks at the man's alien arm and holds out his own arm next to it. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS504
00:59:13,00 --> 00:59:17,50
We're the same. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS505
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:27,50
His eyes glisten as he glances at SOMEONE's<Christopher's> son. He rubs his stubble chin with his thumb. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS506
00:59:28,00 --> 00:59:33,50
We get the fluid back from MNU. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS511
00:59:42,00 --> 00:59:48,50
He hangs his head and massages his temple with his thumb. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS512
00:59:47,00 --> 00:59:52,50
The transformation is accelerating, you do not have much time. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS514
00:59:53,00 --> 01:00:00,50
his pant leg onto his shoes. He stares at the dark spatters, then stands. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS515
01:00:02,00 --> 01:00:07,50
The setting sun burns orange beyond the shadowed urban home. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS516
01:00:06,00 --> 01:00:14,50
The image dissolves to night time, where an alien tosses a blanket onto a bonfire. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS517
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:26,50
Inside the shack, SOMEONE<Wikus> packs a garbage bag. 56 hours after exposure. He tears some of the bandages from his arm and stuffs them in the bag. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS518
01:00:25,00 --> 01:00:42,50
Noticing his reddened chest, SOMEONE<Wikus> grabs a broken mirror. He takes off his shirt and inspects the wound. Twisting around, he seizes back. On the left side, sections of alien exoskeleton protrude from his torn flesh. He touches it. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS521
01:00:48,00 --> 01:00:58,50
He pulls hard on a bloody flap of human skin on his love handle, then lets it hang loose. SOMEONE<Wikus> sits and hangs his head over his fist. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS522
01:01:01,00 --> 01:01:07,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> looks around and finds the cellphone on the bag. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS525
01:02:33,00 --> 01:02:38,50
SOMEONE<Smit> listens in. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS526
01:02:36,00 --> 01:02:41,50
SOMEONE<Koobus> stops headphones. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS527
01:02:40,00 --> 01:02:47,50
Now a helicopter passes in the distance beyond SOMEONE<Christopher> Johnson's shack. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS529
01:02:52,00 --> 01:02:57,50
Reaches behind an old computer monitor. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS530
01:02:55,00 --> 01:03:00,50
He grabs a pamphlet. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS532
01:03:02,00 --> 01:03:07,50
Kneels at the child's side. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS538
01:03:20,00 --> 01:03:26,50
Arrives in the doorway. He watches SOMEONE<Christopher> show his son the MNU. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS542
01:03:36,00 --> 01:03:41,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> knocks, startling the aliens. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS544
01:03:57,00 --> 01:04:01,50
We go up to the mothership. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS545
01:04:02,00 --> 01:04:06,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> sits across from them. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS546
01:04:07,00 --> 01:04:13,50
He glances from his alien arm to the open door. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS548
01:04:39,00 --> 01:04:44,50
Daytime. SOMEONE<Wikus> crosses a dirt road. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS549
01:04:44,00 --> 01:04:52,50
A group of Nigerians, two of them sit on a couch. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS552
01:04:59,00 --> 01:05:03,50
He shows SOMEONE with the alien. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS553
01:05:05,00 --> 01:05:10,50
With a demon. You're one brave white man. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS556
01:05:27,00 --> 01:05:33,50
The thug forces SOMEONE<Wikus> into a shallow ditch, then steps away. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS557
01:05:33,00 --> 01:05:44,50
Another thug opens a curtain, and the bald one wheels SOMEONE<Obesandjo> out. The gangsters keep their guns on SOMEONE<Wikus>, situated low in the ditch before their leader. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS559
01:06:10,00 --> 01:06:14,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> takes out some cash. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS560
01:06:13,00 --> 01:06:19,50
SOMEONE<Obesandjo> grabs SOMEONE<Wikus> and studies his face. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS561
01:06:24,00 --> 01:06:29,50
They pull SOMEONE's<Wikus's> jacket off. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS562
01:06:29,00 --> 01:06:39,50
SOMEONE<Obesandjo> takes SOMEONE's<Wikus's> alien arm in his hand. SOMEONE<Wikus> glances around. The gang leader pulls out a knife and pricks the alien flesh. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS569
01:07:09,00 --> 01:07:15,50
Powers up, as the thug grabs a machete. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS573
01:07:44,00 --> 01:07:50,50
He aims at SOMEONE<Obesandjo>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS574
01:07:51,00 --> 01:07:58,50
SOMEONE<Obesandjo> stares fearlessly into the strange gun's blazing barrel. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS575
01:07:58,00 --> 01:08:04,50
Get that hand. The bald thug brings out a bag of weapons. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS576
01:08:04,00 --> 01:08:13,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> grabs the bag. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS579
01:08:18,00 --> 01:08:24,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Wikus> holds off the others with the alien gun. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS580
01:08:22,00 --> 01:08:27,50
Now an eight-wheeled armored transport sits parked outside 

DISTRICT_9_DVS581
01:08:25,00 --> 01:08:31,50
MNU headquarters. Inside, SOMEONE<Smit> paces in front of SOMEONE<Koobus>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS588
01:09:15,00 --> 01:09:31,50
A ponderous explosion rips into the building's facade. Inside, office workers flee their desks. On the ground, SOMEONE<Wikus> leads the way into the building, armed with an alien blaster. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS590
01:09:34,00 --> 01:09:40,50
To a stairwell and face panicked office workers fleeing downstairs. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS591
01:09:39,00 --> 01:09:45,50
They descend. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS595
01:10:00,00 --> 01:10:07,50
SOMEONE<Koobus> loads his gun. On a lower floor, SOMEONE<Wikus> wearing a gas mask

DISTRICT_9_DVS597
01:10:16,00 --> 01:10:22,50
And the guard shoots him in the chest. SOMEONE<Wikus> fires. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS601
01:10:38,00 --> 01:10:54,50
In a code on a security keypad. Now with their guns aimed, SOMEONE<Koobus> heads down a stairwell with a few other soldiers. They open an elevator. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Wikus> and SOMEONE<Christopher> enter the bio lab. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS602
01:10:55,00 --> 01:11:01,50
Group of doctors. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS604
01:11:04,00 --> 01:11:07,50
They cross the lab. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS606
01:11:15,00 --> 01:11:22,50
SOMEONE<Christopher> tips over another cart. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS607
01:11:20,00 --> 01:11:27,50
Now an elevator door opens, and the soldiers enter a bombed out floor. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS608
01:11:25,00 --> 01:11:33,50
In the bio lab, SOMEONE<Wikus> peers into a windowed case and seize the canister. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS609
01:11:36,00 --> 01:11:41,50
The glassing grabs the canister. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS610
01:11:40,00 --> 01:11:45,50
It’s the mutilated body of a fellow alien. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS611
01:11:44,00 --> 01:11:48,50
Grip on his weapon wearily drop. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS612
01:11:48,00 --> 01:11:53,50
SOMEONE<Christopher> drops his gun completely. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS615
01:12:09,00 --> 01:12:17,50
Electronic doors open, and the focused soldiers pass through the chamber. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS616
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:20,50
He ducks out of the way. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS617
01:12:20,00 --> 01:12:25,50
Position themselves. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS622
01:12:40,00 --> 01:12:56,50
As SOMEONE<Koobus> re-positions himself, SOMEONE<Wikus> peers at SOMEONE<Christopher> through the dust and smoke. SOMEONE<Christopher> snaps out of his trance and joins SOMEONE<Wikus>, who fires again at the humans. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS624
01:13:08,00 --> 01:13:12,50
Fires again. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS627
01:13:27,00 --> 01:13:36,50
Making a bomb. SOMEONE<Christopher> pieces together various weapons parts at a table, then leads SOMEONE<Wikus> through another chamber. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS628
01:13:37,00 --> 01:13:45,50
The breach opens onto a motor pool containing dozens of armored MNU pickups. SOMEONE<Wikus> climbs the car. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS629
01:13:44,00 --> 01:13:52,50
and SOMEONE<Christopher> gets in next to him. Go, drive. SOMEONE<Wikus> pulls out and speeds through the garage. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS631
01:13:55,00 --> 01:14:00,50
A guard fires at their vehicle. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS632
01:14:02,00 --> 01:14:12,50
city reads - Terrorist bombing in downtown JHB. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS633
01:14:13,00 --> 01:14:20,50
A helicopter flies over District 9. SOMEONE<Koobus> rides on board. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS634
01:14:20,00 --> 01:14:27,50
SOMEONE<Koobus> fires at the renegade truck. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS636
01:14:41,00 --> 01:14:48,50
He hurries down a hill. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS638
01:15:02,00 --> 01:15:06,50
Outside, the helicopter flies over 

DISTRICT_9_DVS644
01:15:29,00 --> 01:15:33,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> glares at him. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS650
01:16:10,00 --> 01:16:33,50
The plank, and SOMEONE<Christopher> hits the floor unconscious. SOMEONE<Wikus> wipes his mouth, then picks up the canister. He climbs down through the trap door. Now, the helicopter lands and SOMEONE<Koobus> hops off with a masked soldier. Under the shack, SOMEONE<Wikus> shuts a hatch below the open trapdoor and climbs down. SOMEONE<Koobus> enters the upper level and finds SOMEONE<Christopher> at the opened trapdoor. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS651
01:16:33,00 --> 01:16:38,50
SOMEONE<Christopher> cowers under SOMEONE's<Koobus's> aimed gun. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS652
01:16:37,00 --> 01:16:42,50
He throws SOMEONE<Christopher>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS653
01:16:40,00 --> 01:16:45,50
The alien child points, Father. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS658
01:17:12,00 --> 01:17:18,50
In the ship, SOMEONE<Wikus> approaches a chamber where a pilot seat pops out. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS659
01:17:16,00 --> 01:17:32,50
He takes off his jacket. SOMEONE<Wikus> sits in the chair and pulls down a harness, which engages the seat to move forward to a control station. SOMEONE<Wikus> studies the equipment. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS662
01:17:35,00 --> 01:17:38,50
up at the hatch. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS663
01:17:37,00 --> 01:17:46,50
As SOMEONE<Christopher> struggles on his back, SOMEONE<Koobus> loads his gun and steps on the alien's throat. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS666
01:17:54,00 --> 01:17:58,50
A confused SOMEONE<Wikus> fidgets. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS667
01:17:57,00 --> 01:18:11,50
Next to each of his knees, he finds two angled cylinders filled with greenish jelly. He inserts his alien hand into one, and a holographic screen appears before his eyes. Behind him, the little alien eyes the hatch. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS669
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:16,50
The structure wrecks. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS675
01:19:10,00 --> 01:19:14,50
Fire at the ship, the first misses. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS677
01:19:19,00 --> 01:19:23,50
Now with SOMEONE<Obesandjo>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS678
01:19:23,00 --> 01:19:28,50
Watching the spinning ship on television. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS679
01:19:34,00 --> 01:19:44,50
Drops to his knees, devastated. SOMEONE<Koobus> gazes toward the crash site. My son. SOMEONE<Christopher> stands. My son's in there. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS681
01:19:50,00 --> 01:19:54,50
Crew films the downed ship. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS682
01:19:52,00 --> 01:20:07,50
On the ground, the crashed ship smokes and sparks. The MNU transport arrives, followed by an armored pickup. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS683
01:20:06,00 --> 01:20:11,50
A soldier hops out and shuts the door. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS684
01:20:12,00 --> 01:20:19,50
SOMEONE<Koobus>, aiming a rifle, cautiously approaches an open hatchway to the ship. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS685
01:20:20,00 --> 01:20:28,50
On board, SOMEONE<Wikus> crawls on the floor. SOMEONE<Koobus> stands in the doorway where sunlight floods into the vessel. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS686
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:38,50
Off to the side, the little alien hides behind bundled wiring. SOMEONE<Koobus> enters the ship and turns to find SOMEONE<Wikus> crawling away from him. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS687
01:20:37,00 --> 01:20:45,50
The commander lowers his rifle. Grabbing SOMEONE's<Wikus's> shirt, SOMEONE<Koobus> lifts his captive to his feet. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS688
01:20:44,00 --> 01:20:50,50
He turns SOMEONE<Wikus> around and marches him outside. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS689
01:20:50,00 --> 01:21:00,50
Still unnoticed, the little alien watches them pass. Outside, SOMEONE<Koobus> brings SOMEONE<Wikus> to the pickup and forces him into the backseat. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS693
01:21:18,00 --> 01:21:40,50
As SOMEONE<Christopher> watches from the transport, a rear door shuts, blocking his view. In the pickup, SOMEONE<Wikus> rides with a blank stare. 72 hours after exposure. In the passenger's seat, SOMEONE<Koobus> reloads his handgun. In the transport, a soldier aims a pistol at SOMEONE<Christopher>. In the pickup, SOMEONE<Wikus> remains entranced. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS695
01:21:47,00 --> 01:21:51,50
A gangster aims an RPG. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS696
01:21:51,00 --> 01:21:56,50
The pickup's tail gate trapping them. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS700
01:22:17,00 --> 01:22:21,50
And SOMEONE<Christopher> from the transport. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS701
01:22:22,00 --> 01:22:28,50
As SOMEONE's<Koobus's> men fall back, SOMEONE<Wikus> watches from the truck. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS702
01:22:26,00 --> 01:22:30,50
SOMEONE<Koobus> ducks behind a corner. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS703
01:22:29,00 --> 01:22:34,50
Men advance on the overturned pickup. A man crawls in. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS704
01:22:40,00 --> 01:22:44,50
A light shines on SOMEONE's<Wikus's> SOMEONE<grimace>, as the gangsters haul him out. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS708
01:23:05,00 --> 01:23:17,50
As SOMEONE<Wikus> trenches, his captors maintain their grip on his limbs. In the transport, SOMEONE<Christopher> stands with his arms bound behind him, and peers out a cracked window at the abduction. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS709
01:23:17,00 --> 01:23:23,50
To another window, watching the gangsters dragging SOMEONE away. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS710
01:23:24,00 --> 01:23:38,50
Now aboard the crashed command module, the little alien types and manipulates schematics on the screen. A metal stripe projects a paper-thin panel made of light. The energy panel expands and displays the mothership. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS711
01:23:39,00 --> 01:23:44,50
Now SOMEONE<Wikus> is brought before SOMEONE<Obesandjo>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS714
01:24:08,00 --> 01:24:15,50
A new chopper lands in District 9 and drops off a handful of reinforcements. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS716
01:24:28,00 --> 01:24:40,50
Affords an MNU gunman a wide aerial view. As his peers on the ground take up positions, SOMEONE's<Obesandjo's> men hustle. Above, gangster barks, Kill them, kill all of them. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS719
01:25:00,00 --> 01:25:10,50
SOMEONE<Obesandjo> continues. Once I have that power, no one SOMEONE<will> stop me. It was your turn, now it's mine. As SOMEONE<Koobus> shoots a gangster. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS722
01:25:16,00 --> 01:25:21,50
The gunfight outside continues. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS723
01:25:19,00 --> 01:25:26,50
The gangster missing several teeth accepts a machete. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS724
01:25:36,00 --> 01:25:47,50
Now, the little alien manipulates projected diagrams and activates sections of the mothership. Outside, the real mothership still hovers. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS725
01:25:46,00 --> 01:25:57,50
As the sonic wave sweeps over Johannesburg, hundreds of windows shatter, block after block. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS727
01:25:58,00 --> 01:26:02,50
Up a cut with the machete. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS731
01:26:23,00 --> 01:26:30,50
The robot unleashes the collected bullets in a single blast, and 

DISTRICT_9_DVS732
01:26:29,00 --> 01:26:36,50
it shoots SOMEONE<Obesandjo>. A projectile the size of a soda can launches. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS733
01:26:35,00 --> 01:26:39,50
Cranium swells and explodes. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS734
01:26:39,00 --> 01:26:48,50
Blood and cerebral spinal fluid. Now on the command module, the little alien manipulates more diagrams. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS737
01:27:00,00 --> 01:27:06,50
The robot's arms lower, and its chest cavity opens before him. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS739
01:27:07,00 --> 01:27:28,50
Outside, choppers fly toward the mothership. Aboard one, a mercenary peers at the elaborate technology covering the sunny hall. The choppers appear puny, like hornets before an elephant. On the ground, one of SOMEONE's<Obesandjo's> scorpion-like fighting creatures nibbles on a dead thug lying slumped over the penned fence. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS741
01:27:27,00 --> 01:27:47,50
An alien opens its shaft door and joins a group of five others outside. They gaze into the sky at the drifting mother ship. SOMEONE<Koobus> crouches with his men between two shacks. In the MNU transport, SOMEONE<Christopher> moves to the window and peers out. He watches as the mother ship makes its way across the sky. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS742
01:27:46,00 --> 01:27:50,50
Back with SOMEONE<Koobus>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS743
01:28:01,00 --> 01:28:11,50
SOMEONE<Pienaar> signals, then heads towards the transport. SOMEONE<Wikus> peeks out of the hideout's window and spots the advancing mercenaries. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS744
01:28:10,00 --> 01:28:14,50
On a news report. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS745
01:28:18,00 --> 01:28:22,50
SOMEONE sidesteps into the open area. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS747
01:28:24,00 --> 01:28:30,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> watches from the window as SOMEONE<Pienaar> beats SOMEONE<Christopher> with a baton. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS748
01:28:32,00 --> 01:28:40,50
A mercenary pulls the pin from a smoke grenade and tosses it. SOMEONE<Koobus> signals. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS749
01:28:39,00 --> 01:28:58,50
Mercenaries close-in on the hideout. Inside, the smoke grenade lands on the floor, a few feet from SOMEONE<Wikus>. As it releases a burst of smoke, SOMEONE<Wikus> crouches and covers his mouth. He flinches as another grenade lands in the shack and deploys. With a hard stare, SOMEONE<Wikus> eyes the robot. Outside. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS750
01:28:58,00 --> 01:29:02,50
SOMEONE<Pienaar> points. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS751
01:29:00,00 --> 01:29:09,50
Now, SOMEONE<Wikus> sits inside the robot. A helmet lowers. It secures itself to his head. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS752
01:29:09,00 --> 01:29:13,50
Robot's chest closes. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS754
01:29:18,00 --> 01:29:26,50
In the control seat, data forms a sphere around SOMEONE's<Wikus's> head. SOMEONE<Koobus> steps back. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS758
01:29:40,00 --> 01:29:45,50
SOMEONE<Koobus> moves closer. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS759
01:29:43,00 --> 01:29:59,50
The robot turns to face him. It shifts its shoulders, then tilts its head to look at SOMEONE<Christopher>, who kneels in front of him held at gunpoint by a mercenary. From the control seat, SOMEONE<Wikus> stares sadly. The robot takes a step back. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS760
01:30:09,00 --> 01:30:15,50
As SOMEONE<Wikus> retreats in the robot, SOMEONE<Koobus> talks into his radio. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS762
01:30:18,00 --> 01:30:24,50
SOMEONE<Pienaar> leans toward SOMEONE<Koobus>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS763
01:30:27,00 --> 01:30:33,50
SOMEONE<Koobus> glances at SOMEONE<Christopher>, then heads off. The alien turn 

DISTRICT_9_DVS764
01:30:32,00 --> 01:30:39,50
to the gun-wielding mercenary. Meanwhile, the robot stops across the dry ground. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS765
01:30:38,00 --> 01:30:45,50
Turns its face to the mother ship. In the control seat, SOMEONE<Wikus> cringes. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS768
01:30:50,00 --> 01:31:05,50
The robot turns. Back by the transport, the mercenary aims his gun at SOMEONE's<Christopher's> head. A volt of electricity hits the gun-wielding mercenary dead-on, exploding him and takes off 

DISTRICT_9_DVS769
01:31:03,00 --> 01:31:13,50
SOMEONE's<Pienaar's> arm. SOMEONE<Christopher> looks up to see the robot shooting as it charges over. SOMEONE<Koobus> returns fire, then runs away. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS773
01:31:27,00 --> 01:31:39,50
200 yards away, a cloud of dust and smoke billows from the crashed command module. The little alien steps out. Meanwhile, the robot jumps over a car. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS775
01:31:43,00 --> 01:31:47,50
As the mercenaries fire, SOMEONE<Christopher> uses a piece of metal as a shield. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS777
01:31:55,00 --> 01:31:59,50
Mercenaries' bodies go limp,  

DISTRICT_9_DVS778
01:31:59,00 --> 01:32:12,50
SOMEONE<Koobus> and his men hustle to new positions. A sniper sets up beyond a low concrete barrier. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS779
01:32:18,00 --> 01:32:28,50
The sniper cocks his rifle and steers fixedly into its sight. As SOMEONE<Wikus> and SOMEONE<Christopher> pass, he fires. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS780
01:32:26,00 --> 01:32:34,50
Hits SOMEONE<Wikus>. The sniper aims again. As the robot stands, the sniper fires. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS781
01:32:32,00 --> 01:32:37,50
The robot races away. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS784
01:32:46,00 --> 01:32:51,50
it knocks it off balance. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS787
01:32:59,00 --> 01:33:04,50
Revealing new space. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS790
01:33:29,00 --> 01:33:41,50
Limps away, shielding himself against an onslaught of bullets. Abandoning the metal hatch, he races up a narrow path. Gunfire blast the dirt surrounding him. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS792
01:33:52,00 --> 01:33:56,50
Continuing their assault. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS793
01:34:00,00 --> 01:34:06,50
Mercenaries. Elsewhere, SOMEONE runs at a full sprint after another. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS795
01:34:11,00 --> 01:34:16,50
A machine gunner kicks a sheet metal barrier from a guard top. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS796
01:34:19,00 --> 01:34:24,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Christopher> arrives at the command module's door. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS797
01:34:30,00 --> 01:34:41,50
They fly through a sheet metal wall. SOMEONE<Wikus> turns on the others. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Christopher> enters the command module, his son in his arms. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS798
01:34:38,00 --> 01:34:46,50
Puts the little alien down. The mother ship hovers directly above their craft, rotating slowly. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS800
01:34:50,00 --> 01:34:54,50
A rifle as he advances on SOMEONE<Wikus>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS803
01:35:07,00 --> 01:35:13,50
Thunder side flare. On the news. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS805
01:35:15,00 --> 01:35:22,50
Leaning against the command module's wall, SOMEONE<Christopher> sinks to the floor and draws his son. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS808
01:35:28,00 --> 01:35:32,50
It's deflect off the robot's shell. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS809
01:35:30,00 --> 01:35:34,50
Fire rockets launch. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS811
01:35:37,00 --> 01:35:46,50
From inside, our point of view rolls chaotically. Yards away, the command module lifts off the ground. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS812
01:35:44,00 --> 01:35:54,50
Inside, SOMEONE look wearily. The robot glances toward the rising craft, then fires. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS813
01:35:55,00 --> 01:35:59,50
Outside, the dust clears. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS814
01:35:57,00 --> 01:36:06,50
Several fallen men. Scrambling to his feet, SOMEONE<Koobus> faces a soldier. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS817
01:36:19,00 --> 01:36:24,50
Kneeling, SOMEONE fires a rocket 

DISTRICT_9_DVS820
01:36:38,00 --> 01:36:43,50
He looks its remaining arm, knocking it over. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS822
01:36:48,00 --> 01:36:58,50
Lying back in the control seat, SOMEONE<Wikus> convulses. The machine spurts clear fluid past his face, while the screen flickers behind him. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS823
01:36:59,00 --> 01:37:04,50
He watches the module approach the mother ship. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS824
01:37:06,00 --> 01:37:17,50
He bites his lower lip, SOMEONE coolly steps away. The truck door opens. Its driver climbs out and fires at SOMEONE<Wikus>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS826
01:37:23,00 --> 01:37:39,50
Hundreds of feet above, the command module continues its steady ascent. Inside, SOMEONE's<Christopher's> son clings to him, gazing upward. On the ground, the robot takes a few faltering steps, then falls. As it gets to its feet again,  

DISTRICT_9_DVS827
01:37:37,00 --> 01:37:42,50
SOMEONE<Koobus> arrives behind it, his rifle raised. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS829
01:37:42,00 --> 01:37:47,50
The machine sinks down, and black fluid pours  

DISTRICT_9_DVS830
01:37:47,00 --> 01:37:51,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> stares dully as the main components around him part. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS831
01:37:49,00 --> 01:38:07,50
The facial frame lifts, and he slams forward landing face down in the dirt. The robot topples backward and lies motionless. SOMEONE<Wikus> unsteadily pushes himself up on his elbows, then crawls with strained effort over the littered ground. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS832
01:38:06,00 --> 01:38:12,50
Yards behind him, SOMEONE<Koobus> swaggers through drifting watts of smoke. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS833
01:38:11,00 --> 01:38:18,50
On his belly, SOMEONE<Wikus> continues doggedly through a patch of yellow weeds. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS834
01:38:16,00 --> 01:38:22,50
Above, the command module reaches the mothership. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS835
01:38:20,00 --> 01:38:40,50
Inside, the little alien glances about excitedly, as a shadow sweeps over the cabin. The module locks into place, locking out the radiant blue light. The levitating rocks and SOMEONE<debris> plummet downward. In the module, SOMEONE's<Christopher's> son watches lights blink on throughout the interior. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS837
01:38:44,00 --> 01:38:59,50
On the ground, a trembling SOMEONE<Wikus> wills his arms forward, one after the other as he drags himself along the ground. As we watch from behind the blasted brick wall, a caption reads - 74 hours after exposure. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS838
01:39:00,00 --> 01:39:12,50
Strides over, draws a pistol and takes aim. Spotting the colonel, SOMEONE<Wikus> rolls over to face him and raises his trembling human hand. His scalp bears swollen bald patches. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS839
01:39:15,00 --> 01:39:23,50
SOMEONE<Wikus> stares through one blue eye and one yellow eye, double its previous size. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS840
01:39:30,00 --> 01:39:35,50
A red splotched alien spies them. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS841
01:39:34,00 --> 01:39:47,50
He trails his arm down SOMEONE's<Wikus's> body. Looking up, he springs to his feet and points his gun at the red alien, who now stands before him. Two more arrive behind SOMEONE<Koobus>. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS842
01:39:45,00 --> 01:39:49,50
The colonel turns. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS843
01:39:47,00 --> 01:39:52,50
A fourth alien leaps over a mount of rubble. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS844
01:39:50,00 --> 01:39:58,50
As the aliens advance on SOMEONE<Koobus>, SOMEONE<Wikus> stares wide-eyed. The colonel shoots two of them. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS845
01:39:57,00 --> 01:40:13,50
One rips his head off. SOMEONE<Wikus> recoils. From a bird's eye view, we watch the aliens dismember SOMEONE<Koobus> and devour his flesh. SOMEONE's<Wikus's> overwhelmed gaze shifts below small dark green plates, peeking out from his hairline. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS846
01:40:12,00 --> 01:40:17,50
He gradually manages to collect himself. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS847
01:40:15,00 --> 01:40:28,50
He casts his earnest gaze upward. In the command module, SOMEONE<Christopher> lumbers to the pilot's chair and flops down. It carries him to the holographic navigation frame.

01:40:26,00 --> 01:40:45,50
His son hops up on his knee as the screen blinks to life. Within a circular blue graphic, a three-dimensional intergalactic map appears. SOMEONE<Christopher> makes selections from the blue graph, and the map hones in on a galaxy. The alien zooms in on a pair of twin stars and selects one. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS849
01:40:44,00 --> 01:40:48,50
He brings up a blue planet. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS850
01:40:47,00 --> 01:40:53,50
It shows a saucer-like jet at its perimeter. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS851
01:40:52,00 --> 01:41:11,50
A second jet activates. SOMEONE<Wikus> watches with a heaving chest. He swallows, allowing a faint smile. As we watch from a distant field, a wave of dust blast toward us. The mothership rises. In the slum, aliens freeze in their tracks, staring upward. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS852
01:41:10,00 --> 01:41:21,50
Now, we follow a news helicopter's point of view. A caption reads - Historic moment, as alien mothership leaves earth. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS860
01:41:53,00 --> 01:41:57,50
SOMEONE<Bradnam> gazes pensively. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS861
01:42:00,00 --> 01:42:26,50
On-board the command module, SOMEONE<Christopher> leans back on his seat, blinking heavily. The soft tendrils over his mouth sway lazily, the jointed maxillary palps flicking out on either side. He gazes down at the child in his lap, then eyes the navigation screen. From the ground, SOMEONE<Wikus> stares upward, his mismatched eyes glistening. Bowing his head, he shields his face. We watch him from above. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS862
01:43:26,00 --> 01:43:31,50
SOMEONE<Fundiswa> wears an orange jumpsuit. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS863
01:43:30,00 --> 01:43:39,50
Words appear - SOMEONE is currently awaiting trial for exposing MNU's illegal genetic research program. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS864
01:43:37,00 --> 01:43:51,50
District 9 was demolished after the alien resettlement operation was completed. District 10 now houses 2. 5 million aliens and continues to grow. At SOMEONE's<Wikus's> desk interview,

DISTRICT_9_DVS865
01:43:52,00 --> 01:43:56,50
there's a wedding photo. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS867
01:44:10,00 --> 01:44:19,50
Now, SOMEONE<Tania> gingerly unwraps a bundle of pink tissue, revealing a delicate metal sculpture of a flower. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS868
01:44:21,00 --> 01:44:25,50
She stares tenderly at it. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS869
01:44:27,00 --> 01:44:32,50
A framed wedding photo stands nearby. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS870
01:44:36,00 --> 01:44:46,50
In a meadow field of rubbish, an alien in blood-stained rags crafts another flower. With a caring gaze, he gingerly adjust the petals. 

DISTRICT_9_DVS871
01:44:45,00 --> 01:44:52,50
Glances up at us, then finishes the flower. Turning to profile, he holds up the imitation
