EASY_A_DVS13
00:02:57,00 --> 00:03:01,50
The teacher catches a boy with a joint. 

EASY_A_DVS14
00:04:02,00 --> 00:04:07,50
He offers a bong. 

EASY_A_DVS15
00:04:07,00 --> 00:04:12,50
She reaches for it, letting her breasts hang out. 

EASY_A_DVS16
00:04:34,00 --> 00:04:45,50
Friday afternoon, SOMEONE opens a greeting card that reads, "To my granddaughter, you're my pocket full of sunshine. " She finds a $5 SOMEONE inside. 

EASY_A_DVS17
00:04:46,00 --> 00:04:51,50
Saturday morning, SOMEONE<Olive> opens the card again. 

EASY_A_DVS18
00:04:50,00 --> 00:04:57,50
Painting her toenails, she sings to a dog on her bed, then paints the dog's nails. 

EASY_A_DVS19
00:04:56,00 --> 00:05:00,50
Saturday afternoon. 

EASY_A_DVS20
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:09,50
Saturday night, SOMEONE<Olive> kneels before her dog, shaking her hips. Sunday morning, SOMEONE<Olive> repeatedly opens and shuts the card. 

EASY_A_DVS21
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:15,50
Sunday afternoon, in the shower. 

EASY_A_DVS23
00:05:28,00 --> 00:05:34,50
She glances about, then shuts the card and joins the dog on her bed. 

EASY_A_DVS24
00:06:12,00 --> 00:06:16,50
In the ladies room. 

EASY_A_DVS25
00:07:09,00 --> 00:07:16,50
Another girl steps out of a stall and glares at SOMEONE<Olive>, while washing her hands. 

EASY_A_DVS26
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:25,50
She flicks water at SOMEONE<Rhiannon>, and leaves. 

EASY_A_DVS27
00:07:32,00 --> 00:07:37,50
SOMEONE<Marianne> passes out flyers. 

EASY_A_DVS28
00:07:38,00 --> 00:07:41,50
Last year. 

EASY_A_DVS29
00:07:42,00 --> 00:07:56,50
A guy in a devil costume tears through a banner, his face and bare chest painted blue. Launching off a trampoline, he flips and dunks a basketball then hangs from the hoop. He throws his toy pitchfork into the crowd. 

EASY_A_DVS31
00:08:05,00 --> 00:08:08,50
This year. 

EASY_A_DVS32
00:08:08,00 --> 00:08:17,50
A plush Woodchuck mascot rips through a banner with a wheelbarrow of logs. He pretends to gnaw on one. 

EASY_A_DVS33
00:08:23,00 --> 00:08:29,50
He launches off the trampoline for a dunk, but falls on his face. 

EASY_A_DVS34
00:08:33,00 --> 00:08:37,50
He shows a title. 

EASY_A_DVS35
00:08:50,00 --> 00:09:04,50
Our view dashes across the school grounds to a guy on a cellphone. We zip into a classroom where a few students read a text message. In a theater class, a guy checks his phone while lying on stage mid rehearsal. 

EASY_A_DVS36
00:09:02,00 --> 00:09:12,50
We zoom out the window, then zip around the building into another class. Where a girl turns to show a text to a friend at a desk behind her. 

EASY_A_DVS37
00:09:11,00 --> 00:09:22,50
The friend turns to a guy behind her, then we shoot outside past a row of lockers to find SOMEONE<Olive>. The red-haired teen stands alone. Listening to the chatter. 

EASY_A_DVS38
00:09:22,00 --> 00:09:28,50
Turning to go, she runs into SOMEONE<Marianne> with a snooty friend. 

EASY_A_DVS39
00:09:39,00 --> 00:09:45,50
They pat their hearts and raise their hands to the sky. 

EASY_A_DVS40
00:10:24,00 --> 00:10:29,50
She rejoins SOMEONE<Nina>. 

EASY_A_DVS41
00:11:50,00 --> 00:11:54,50
Now at home. 

EASY_A_DVS42
00:11:59,00 --> 00:12:04,50
A black boy sits beside her. 

EASY_A_DVS43
00:13:09,00 --> 00:13:14,50
At school her peers stare. 

EASY_A_DVS44
00:15:08,00 --> 00:15:13,50
SOMEONE's<Nina's> hand shoots up. 

EASY_A_DVS45
00:15:21,00 --> 00:15:25,50
She faces SOMEONE<Olive>. 

EASY_A_DVS46
00:15:36,00 --> 00:15:45,50
Now SOMEONE<Marianne> glares at SOMEONE<Olive>, from behind an administrative counter, while aggressively stapling a document. 

EASY_A_DVS47
00:16:04,00 --> 00:16:09,50
SOMEONE<Marianne> pounds on the stapler. 

EASY_A_DVS48
00:16:12,00 --> 00:16:20,50
An athletic team steps into view, followed by a smaller guy holding a rag to his bloody nose. 

EASY_A_DVS49
00:16:19,00 --> 00:16:24,50
Now in the principal's office. 

EASY_A_DVS50
00:17:19,00 --> 00:17:23,50
He scribbles on a slip. 

EASY_A_DVS51
00:17:31,00 --> 00:17:35,50
He points at the door. 

EASY_A_DVS52
00:17:42,00 --> 00:17:49,50
Outside Woodchuck SOMEONE<Todd> carries the head of his costume as he falls into step with SOMEONE<Olive>. 

EASY_A_DVS53
00:18:12,00 --> 00:18:16,50
He high fives a guy. 

EASY_A_DVS54
00:18:16,00 --> 00:18:20,50
SOMEONE<Rhiannon> joins SOMEONE<Olive>. 

EASY_A_DVS55
00:18:50,00 --> 00:18:54,50
SOMEONE<Rhiannon> mimics a boxer. 

EASY_A_DVS56
00:18:57,00 --> 00:19:05,50
She musses her friend's hair and saunters off. Now at home, SOMEONE's<Olive's> mother serves her peas. 

EASY_A_DVS57
00:19:21,00 --> 00:19:26,50
SOMEONE<Olive> eyes her younger brother. 

EASY_A_DVS59
00:20:18,00 --> 00:20:23,50
Her brother eyes her plate. 

EASY_A_DVS60
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:06,50
She kisses her mom. 

EASY_A_DVS61
00:21:11,00 --> 00:21:15,50
Her husband sits with their son. 

EASY_A_DVS62
00:21:14,00 --> 00:21:19,50
Now SOMEONE<Olive> mops the gym. 

EASY_A_DVS63
00:22:02,00 --> 00:22:08,50
She grins at him. Now they clean a tennis court. 

EASY_A_DVS64
00:22:22,00 --> 00:22:28,50
Later, SOMEONE<Olive> wipes graffiti from a bathroom stall. 

EASY_A_DVS65
00:22:27,00 --> 00:22:31,50
SOMEONE<Brandon> adds graffiti. 

EASY_A_DVS66
00:23:38,00 --> 00:23:43,50
Now on a ridge overlooking the town. 

EASY_A_DVS67
00:24:23,00 --> 00:24:30,50
Lounging on the hood of an old VW bug, SOMEONE<Olive> reaches through the window and takes out her cellphone. 

EASY_A_DVS68
00:24:54,00 --> 00:24:58,50
SOMEONE<Olive> nods. 

EASY_A_DVS69
00:25:15,00 --> 00:25:20,50
We peer through an arched hedge. 

EASY_A_DVS70
00:25:18,00 --> 00:25:31,50
SOMEONE<Brandon> rides into view on a scooter, lurches to a halt and dismounts awkwardly. He arrives at the Penderghast front door and knocks. SOMEONE's<Olive's> mother answers with a warm delighted smile. 

EASY_A_DVS71
00:25:39,00 --> 00:25:43,50
She pulls him inside. 

EASY_A_DVS72
00:25:42,00 --> 00:25:46,50
She faces a stairway. 

EASY_A_DVS73
00:25:58,00 --> 00:26:03,50
She leads SOMEONE<Brandon> upstairs. 

EASY_A_DVS74
00:27:20,00 --> 00:27:27,50
Under her puzzled stare, SOMEONE<Brandon> screws up his mouth and nods coolly. 

EASY_A_DVS75
00:28:38,00 --> 00:28:43,50
His eyes well with tears. 

EASY_A_DVS76
00:28:40,00 --> 00:28:45,50
SOMEONE<Olive> shakes her head. 

EASY_A_DVS77
00:28:43,00 --> 00:28:48,50
SOMEONE<Brandon> stares imploringly at her. 

EASY_A_DVS78
00:29:17,00 --> 00:29:23,50
At the party, two teens water slide into a pool. 

EASY_A_DVS79
00:29:56,00 --> 00:30:00,50
She leans close to Melody. 

EASY_A_DVS80
00:30:22,00 --> 00:30:27,50
She pretends to munch on his ear. 

EASY_A_DVS81
00:30:38,00 --> 00:30:42,50
She shuts the door. 

EASY_A_DVS82
00:30:40,00 --> 00:30:46,50
She slips off a pair of red SOMEONE<lacy> panties from under her skirt. 

EASY_A_DVS83
00:30:53,00 --> 00:30:58,50
She hangs them on the doorknob, blocking the keyhole. 

EASY_A_DVS84
00:30:55,00 --> 00:31:02,50
The bully tries to peer through, as a crowd gathers. SOMEONE<Brandon> eyes the drapes. 

EASY_A_DVS85
00:31:06,00 --> 00:31:10,50
He goes to the bed. 

EASY_A_DVS86
00:31:21,00 --> 00:31:26,50
The eavesdropping team swap looks. 

EASY_A_DVS87
00:31:29,00 --> 00:31:35,50
She slaps him, then cups a hand over his mouth. 

EASY_A_DVS88
00:31:49,00 --> 00:31:54,50
She spanks him with a book. 

EASY_A_DVS89
00:32:01,00 --> 00:32:06,50
He yanks him to his feet. 

EASY_A_DVS90
00:32:07,00 --> 00:32:12,50
SOMEONE<Olive> and SOMEONE<Brandon> jump on the bed and smack the wall. 

EASY_A_DVS91
00:32:25,00 --> 00:32:30,50
He slaps her rear end and she smacks him. 

EASY_A_DVS92
00:32:57,00 --> 00:33:01,50
She punches him in the gut. 

EASY_A_DVS93
00:33:05,00 --> 00:33:11,50
SOMEONE<Olive> hops down off the bed as SOMEONE<Brandon> recovers. 

EASY_A_DVS94
00:33:11,00 --> 00:33:16,50
As he stands, she musses his hair and rumbles his shirt. 

EASY_A_DVS95
00:33:17,00 --> 00:33:22,50
Pausing, SOMEONE<Brandon> grabs her arm. 

EASY_A_DVS96
00:33:20,00 --> 00:33:25,50
Olives meets his earnest gaze. 

EASY_A_DVS97
00:33:23,00 --> 00:33:29,50
As she smiles and nods, he leans his forehead against hers. 

EASY_A_DVS98
00:33:28,00 --> 00:33:35,50
SOMEONE<Olive> beams kindly, and gives another nod. Facing the door, SOMEONE<Brandon> halts. 

EASY_A_DVS99
00:33:34,00 --> 00:33:40,50
He hands her the panties. SOMEONE<Olive> salutes him, then stuffs them in his pocket. 

EASY_A_DVS100
00:33:41,00 --> 00:33:47,50
The eavesdroppers scatter as SOMEONE<Brandon> opens the door. 

EASY_A_DVS101
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:51,50
He heads into the hallway. 

EASY_A_DVS102
00:33:51,00 --> 00:33:56,50
His bully accosts him. 

EASY_A_DVS103
00:34:06,00 --> 00:34:20,50
The bully gives him a friendly shove into a crowd of congratulatory males. As SOMEONE<Olive> makes her way through the hallway, other teens clear a path and stare at her. She nearly bumps into SOMEONE<Todd> at a doorway. 

EASY_A_DVS104
00:34:43,00 --> 00:34:49,50
Behind her back, several guys crudely thrust their pelvises. 

EASY_A_DVS105
00:34:47,00 --> 00:34:52,50
As she turns around, they sheepishly stop. 

EASY_A_DVS106
00:35:18,00 --> 00:35:23,50
Now SOMEONE<Olive> plays an acoustic guitar in her room. 

EASY_A_DVS107
00:35:22,00 --> 00:35:28,50
Her mother enters, bearing a green box wrapped with a blue ribbon. 

EASY_A_DVS108
00:36:26,00 --> 00:36:31,50
Her mother bumps and grinds her hips on her way out. 

EASY_A_DVS109
00:36:37,00 --> 00:36:45,50
SOMEONE<Olive> bonds unto her bed and opens the box. Inside she finds a greeting card with a gift card. 

EASY_A_DVS110
00:36:47,00 --> 00:36:53,50
She pulls out a phallic object wrapped in tissue. 

EASY_A_DVS111
00:36:52,00 --> 00:36:58,50
SOMEONE<Olive> sets it back in the box, and answers her cell. 

EASY_A_DVS112
00:37:05,00 --> 00:37:09,50
The box vibrates. 

EASY_A_DVS113
00:38:01,00 --> 00:38:05,50
She ends the call. 

EASY_A_DVS114
00:38:08,00 --> 00:38:14,50
She flings all the clothes out of her closet and storms out. 

EASY_A_DVS115
00:38:12,00 --> 00:38:27,50
Later, she returns toting a half dozen shopping bags. Now SOMEONE<Olive> tears red fabric into scraps then meticulously cuts them up with scissors as her dog looks on. 

EASY_A_DVS116
00:38:25,00 --> 00:38:32,50
Pulling bustiers from the shopping bags, she sits to work with a needle and thread. 

EASY_A_DVS117
00:38:30,00 --> 00:38:34,50
She pricks herself. 

EASY_A_DVS118
00:38:32,00 --> 00:38:38,50
She sucks her thumb, but keeps working, cutting the thread with her teeth. 

EASY_A_DVS119
00:38:36,00 --> 00:38:40,50
Her father steps in. 

EASY_A_DVS121
00:39:07,00 --> 00:39:17,50
They share a grin, and he heads out. Later SOMEONE<Olive> sews with a smile. She bites off the thread then studies her handiwork. 

EASY_A_DVS123
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:38,50
In an outdoor breezeway, SOMEONE<Olive> struts into a crowd of students wearing a black bustier with a red letter A sewn to the bust. A double strand of pearls rings her neck, and her auburn hair falls in soft curls around her face. Dark sunglasses hide her eyes above her coy smile. As she sashays onward, the students stare at her. 

EASY_A_DVS124
00:39:36,00 --> 00:39:40,50
She makes a kissy face. 

EASY_A_DVS125
00:39:37,00 --> 00:39:44,50
A girl and guy watched slack-jawed. SOMEONE<Olive> smirks to herself. 

EASY_A_DVS126
00:39:41,00 --> 00:39:52,50
With a bustier showing off her narrow waist, she halts facing SOMEONE<Rhiannon> and SOMEONE<Anson>. The blonde eyes her friend scandalous outfit, and shakes her head. 

EASY_A_DVS127
00:40:04,00 --> 00:40:09,50
SOMEONE<Rhiannon> frowns. 

EASY_A_DVS128
00:40:24,00 --> 00:40:28,50
SOMEONE<Rhiannon> smacks SOMEONE<Anson>. 

EASY_A_DVS129
00:40:28,00 --> 00:40:38,50
Now at the lunch counter, SOMEONE<Olive> serves herself mashed potatoes. Two guys ogle her. She eats some of her potatoes, and sucks the spoon. 

EASY_A_DVS130
00:40:37,00 --> 00:40:46,50
One guy drops his tray. As they scramble away, SOMEONE<Olive> finds herself facing SOMEONE<Marianne>, who snares and heads off. 

EASY_A_DVS131
00:40:43,00 --> 00:40:50,50
Seeing Mr. SOMEONE<Griffith> behind her, SOMEONE<Olive> yanks the spoon from her mouth. 

EASY_A_DVS132
00:40:57,00 --> 00:41:01,50
Now in a gazebo. 

EASY_A_DVS133
00:41:59,00 --> 00:42:03,50
She points at everyone. 

EASY_A_DVS134
00:42:07,00 --> 00:42:13,50
A hunky guy with a cross necklace accompanies a boy on guitar. 

EASY_A_DVS135
00:42:42,00 --> 00:42:47,50
SOMEONE<Todd> climbs out of a lap pool. 

EASY_A_DVS136
00:43:05,00 --> 00:43:11,50
He gives her a playful shove. A chubby guy drives off behind her. 

EASY_A_DVS137
00:43:38,00 --> 00:43:43,50
She stutters and stalks off. 

EASY_A_DVS138
00:43:42,00 --> 00:43:48,50
She gives him an angry gape. SOMEONE<Evan> blinks shamefully. 

EASY_A_DVS139
00:43:57,00 --> 00:44:02,50
He gestures at his chunky build. 

EASY_A_DVS140
00:44:03,00 --> 00:44:07,50
He plods away. 

EASY_A_DVS141
00:44:04,00 --> 00:44:09,50
SOMEONE<Olive> lingers, brushing her hair back. 

EASY_A_DVS142
00:44:06,00 --> 00:44:12,50
She watches as SOMEONE<Evan> plops down on a bench. 

EASY_A_DVS143
00:44:18,00 --> 00:44:24,50
He glumly eats a snack. SOMEONE<Olive> bombs her head equivocatingly. 

EASY_A_DVS144
00:45:19,00 --> 00:45:25,50
His hopeful expression fades as she saunters off. 

EASY_A_DVS145
00:45:33,00 --> 00:45:41,50
Our view zooms from guys texting at the pool, to more guys huddle around a cellphone on the soccer field. 

EASY_A_DVS146
00:45:38,00 --> 00:45:48,50
Nearby, a girl talks to a football player. She heads to the track, where four other girls race, then stop and huddle around a phone. 

EASY_A_DVS147
00:45:47,00 --> 00:45:53,50
Our view whizzes to the bleachers, where another girl chats with a couple. 

EASY_A_DVS148
00:45:52,00 --> 00:46:08,50
We zoom through tennis courts, through a locker room, and into the gym. A dance team reads a text, as they rehearse a can-can. We whiz back through the locker room, to the lap pool, where SOMEONE<Olive> stands uncomfortably. A guy points at her. 

EASY_A_DVS149
00:46:27,00 --> 00:46:31,50
A Christian boy play guitar. 

EASY_A_DVS150
00:47:45,00 --> 00:47:49,50
Paris Bueller sings. 

EASY_A_DVS151
00:48:06,00 --> 00:48:12,50
SOMEONE<Olive> shows another page to her webcam. 

EASY_A_DVS152
00:48:14,00 --> 00:48:19,50
Now she knocks on Mr. SOMEONE's<Griffith's> open door. 

EASY_A_DVS153
00:48:21,00 --> 00:48:26,50
She takes a seat facing his desk. 

EASY_A_DVS154
00:48:23,00 --> 00:48:30,50
He nods, then waggles a finger at a scarlet A on her pink bustier. 

EASY_A_DVS155
00:50:17,00 --> 00:50:22,50
A tall blonde enters. 

EASY_A_DVS156
00:50:25,00 --> 00:50:29,50
SOMEONE<Olive> leaves. 

EASY_A_DVS157
00:50:38,00 --> 00:50:43,50
As they kiss, he gropes her rear. 

EASY_A_DVS158
00:51:24,00 --> 00:51:29,50
He pinches her butt. 

EASY_A_DVS159
00:51:35,00 --> 00:51:47,50
He stares longingly after his wife, then frowns and shifts his gaze. Now in the administrative office, SOMEONE<Marianne> sharpens pencils and blows off the shavings. 

EASY_A_DVS160
00:51:59,00 --> 00:52:05,50
SOMEONE<Marianne> scowls at SOMEONE<Olive>, who winks back at her. 

EASY_A_DVS162
00:52:44,00 --> 00:52:48,50
She shows a plaque. 

EASY_A_DVS163
00:52:48,00 --> 00:52:52,50
SOMEONE<Olive> nods blankly. 

EASY_A_DVS164
00:52:53,00 --> 00:52:58,50
She offers a handful of condoms. 

EASY_A_DVS165
00:53:24,00 --> 00:53:31,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Griffith> nods and smiles as SOMEONE<Olive> collects her things. 

EASY_A_DVS166
00:53:31,00 --> 00:53:37,50
In the main office, SOMEONE<Olive> finds SOMEONE<Marianne> comforting Micah. 

EASY_A_DVS167
00:53:36,00 --> 00:53:45,50
SOMEONE<Marianne> squeezes his arm and murmurs. He tearfully heads toward the counselor's office. 

EASY_A_DVS168
00:53:44,00 --> 00:53:52,50
She kisses her fingers, pats her hand over her heart, then raises it skyward. Micah does the same. 

EASY_A_DVS169
00:54:34,00 --> 00:54:41,50
SOMEONE<Olive> takes a seat beside SOMEONE<Marianne>, and awkwardly pats the sobbing girl's head. 

EASY_A_DVS170
00:54:51,00 --> 00:54:56,50
SOMEONE<Marianne> grabs her. 

EASY_A_DVS171
00:54:57,00 --> 00:55:02,50
She yanks her into a hug. 

EASY_A_DVS172
00:55:20,00 --> 00:55:25,50
SOMEONE<Marianne> seizes her in another hug. 

EASY_A_DVS173
00:55:28,00 --> 00:55:32,50
SOMEONE<Olive> shakes her head. 

EASY_A_DVS174
00:55:47,00 --> 00:55:53,50
As they hug again, SOMEONE<Marianne> sniffs her hair. 

EASY_A_DVS175
00:55:56,00 --> 00:56:01,50
The next day they hug again. 

EASY_A_DVS176
00:56:07,00 --> 00:56:17,50
SOMEONE<Marianne> points at her phone. SOMEONE<Olive> reads her text. "Hey girlie, hang after SKL today, xoxox. WWJD. " 

EASY_A_DVS177
00:56:17,00 --> 00:56:26,50
SOMEONE<Marianne> points at her ceramics partner and mimes gagging. SOMEONE<Olive> gives a sarcastic thumbs up. 

EASY_A_DVS178
00:56:36,00 --> 00:56:43,50
As they hug, SOMEONE<Marianne> rests her hand near a spinning table saw. 

EASY_A_DVS179
00:56:41,00 --> 00:56:48,50
SOMEONE<Olive> uses a wooden cross to edge it away. Now in a hospital room. 

EASY_A_DVS180
00:56:58,00 --> 00:57:03,50
His mother swats him. 

EASY_A_DVS181
00:57:02,00 --> 00:57:08,50
She smacks him again. Later she uses her cellphone. 

EASY_A_DVS182
00:57:13,00 --> 00:57:18,50
Now in the school office, SOMEONE<Marianne> holds a phone to her ear. 

EASY_A_DVS183
00:57:17,00 --> 00:57:22,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Griffith> steps in and overhears. 

EASY_A_DVS184
00:57:22,00 --> 00:57:27,50
Now SOMEONE<Marianne> storms into the locker room. 

EASY_A_DVS185
00:57:26,00 --> 00:57:30,50
She slaps SOMEONE<Olive>. 

EASY_A_DVS186
00:57:31,00 --> 00:57:37,50
SOMEONE<Rhiannon> smirks. Now Micah uses his cell. 

EASY_A_DVS187
00:58:11,00 --> 00:58:15,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Griffith> hangs up. 

EASY_A_DVS188
00:58:12,00 --> 00:58:18,50
She paces in her office, a hand cupped over her mouth. 

EASY_A_DVS189
00:58:16,00 --> 00:58:20,50
SOMEONE<Olive> walks in. 

EASY_A_DVS190
00:58:22,00 --> 00:58:29,50
She throws a photo of herself with her husband into a box, breaking the frame. 

EASY_A_DVS191
00:59:59,00 --> 01:00:05,50
SOMEONE<Olive> stares sympathetically at the tearful guidance counselor. 

EASY_A_DVS192
01:00:15,00 --> 01:00:19,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Griffith> looks up at her. 

EASY_A_DVS193
01:00:35,00 --> 01:00:41,50
She nods emphatically. SOMEONE<Olive> lays a hand on her shoulder. 

EASY_A_DVS194
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:51,50
SOMEONE<Olive> winces, then lowers her hand. 

EASY_A_DVS195
01:00:50,00 --> 01:00:57,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Griffith> pulls her into a hug. Her hair pokes into SOMEONE's<Olive's> mouth. 

EASY_A_DVS196
01:00:56,00 --> 01:01:05,50
Later SOMEONE steps outside, to find the fundamentalists holding signs reading variations of, "Olive is a slut. " 

EASY_A_DVS197
01:01:19,00 --> 01:01:23,50
SOMEONE<Rhiannon> pickets. 

EASY_A_DVS198
01:01:40,00 --> 01:01:47,50
She rejoins the group. As SOMEONE<Olive> starts to leave, she bumps into SOMEONE<Todd>. 

EASY_A_DVS199
01:01:46,00 --> 01:01:51,50
He glimpses at the protesters. 

EASY_A_DVS200
01:01:56,00 --> 01:02:01,50
SOMEONE<Olive> turns away. 

EASY_A_DVS201
01:02:03,00 --> 01:02:10,50
With her back to SOMEONE<Todd> and the protesters, she wears a wounded stare as she walks away. 

EASY_A_DVS202
01:02:19,00 --> 01:02:23,50
At a bookstore. 

EASY_A_DVS203
01:02:38,00 --> 01:02:42,50
Later she flips through a Bible. 

EASY_A_DVS204
01:02:53,00 --> 01:02:57,50
Now at a church. 

EASY_A_DVS205
01:02:59,00 --> 01:03:04,50
SOMEONE<Olive> steps into a confessional booth. 

EASY_A_DVS206
01:03:45,00 --> 01:03:50,50
SOMEONE's<Olive's> large green eyes glisten. 

EASY_A_DVS207
01:03:58,00 --> 01:04:05,50
The young outcast gives a slow nod, then shrugs tearfully. 

EASY_A_DVS208
01:04:06,00 --> 01:04:14,50
Light from the confessional's grated screen cast an ornate shadow pattern against her cheek. 

EASY_A_DVS209
01:04:21,00 --> 01:04:26,50
Looking in, she finds the priest's booth empty. 

EASY_A_DVS210
01:04:25,00 --> 01:04:34,50
She leaves the confessional and rushes past a pew, knocking a Bible from the seat. She puts it back and hurries out. 

EASY_A_DVS211
01:04:49,00 --> 01:04:54,50
Now in the pastor's office. 

EASY_A_DVS212
01:05:18,00 --> 01:05:23,50
His placid smile briefly vanishes. 

EASY_A_DVS213
01:05:27,00 --> 01:05:34,50
She knocks over a family photo. Righting it, she finds SOMEONE<Marianne> in the picture. 

EASY_A_DVS214
01:05:39,00 --> 01:05:45,50
She topples another photo of him and SOMEONE<Marianne>. 

EASY_A_DVS215
01:05:58,00 --> 01:06:04,50
Now at home, SOMEONE<Olive> sits on a sectional with her mom and brother. 

EASY_A_DVS216
01:08:09,00 --> 01:08:13,50
In the cafeteria. 

EASY_A_DVS217
01:08:42,00 --> 01:08:47,50
SOMEONE<Olive> smiles as he stands. 

EASY_A_DVS218
01:08:56,00 --> 01:09:01,50
She beams softly to herself. 

EASY_A_DVS219
01:08:58,00 --> 01:09:06,50
Nighttime at the Lobster Shack, SOMEONE<Anson> shares a booth with SOMEONE<Olive> who wears a demure black dress. 

EASY_A_DVS220
01:09:15,00 --> 01:09:19,50
He smiles boyishly. 

EASY_A_DVS221
01:09:20,00 --> 01:09:28,50
Under SOMEONE's<Anson's> unwavering gaze, SOMEONE<Olive> gives a nervous nod, then looks down at the table. 

EASY_A_DVS222
01:10:32,00 --> 01:10:38,50
Wearing a plush lobster on his head, SOMEONE<Todd> leads fellow servers to a table. 

EASY_A_DVS223
01:10:51,00 --> 01:10:58,50
Watching fondly, SOMEONE<Olive> spies SOMEONE<Rhiannon> on the other side of a fish tank. 

EASY_A_DVS224
01:11:44,00 --> 01:11:49,50
SOMEONE<Rhiannon> spots them. 

EASY_A_DVS225
01:11:49,00 --> 01:11:54,50
Sneaking out, SOMEONE<Olive> glances over and finds her staring. 

EASY_A_DVS226
01:11:53,00 --> 01:11:57,50
SOMEONE<Olive> turns away. 

EASY_A_DVS227
01:11:55,00 --> 01:12:00,50
Later, SOMEONE<Anson> walks her to a car. 

EASY_A_DVS228
01:11:59,00 --> 01:12:04,50
She starts to open the passenger door, but he shuts it. 

EASY_A_DVS229
01:12:03,00 --> 01:12:08,50
He presents a gift card. 

EASY_A_DVS230
01:12:08,00 --> 01:12:13,50
Staring at it, SOMEONE<Olive> tears up and bites her lip. 

EASY_A_DVS231
01:12:21,00 --> 01:12:27,50
SOMEONE<Olive> looks up at him with a wounded glare. 

EASY_A_DVS232
01:12:28,00 --> 01:12:33,50
He kisses her. She pulls back. 

EASY_A_DVS233
01:12:33,00 --> 01:12:38,50
He tries again. She pushes him away. 

EASY_A_DVS234
01:12:44,00 --> 01:12:48,50
He grabs her. 

EASY_A_DVS235
01:12:47,00 --> 01:12:51,50
She shoves him. 

EASY_A_DVS236
01:12:50,00 --> 01:12:55,50
He leans in again. 

EASY_A_DVS237
01:12:53,00 --> 01:12:59,50
SOMEONE<Olive> wrestles him off her. Then marches toward the restaurant. 

EASY_A_DVS238
01:13:00,00 --> 01:13:05,50
She chucks the gift card at him. 

EASY_A_DVS239
01:13:03,00 --> 01:13:09,50
She turns her back to him and cries. 

EASY_A_DVS240
01:13:10,00 --> 01:13:16,50
She bites her lip hard. SOMEONE<Anson> gets in his car. 

EASY_A_DVS241
01:13:15,00 --> 01:13:20,50
SOMEONE<Olive> picks at the stitching of her A. 

EASY_A_DVS242
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:23,50
SOMEONE<Todd> comes out from the back of the building. 

EASY_A_DVS243
01:13:22,00 --> 01:13:29,50
SOMEONE's<Anson's> car peals through the parking lot as the off-duty waiter approaches the tearful girl. 

EASY_A_DVS244
01:13:43,00 --> 01:13:48,50
She gives a grateful nod. 

EASY_A_DVS245
01:13:48,00 --> 01:13:54,50
Now SOMEONE<Todd> drives, as SOMEONE<Olive> cries in the passenger seat. 

EASY_A_DVS246
01:13:53,00 --> 01:13:58,50
She shakes her head, wincing tearfully. 

EASY_A_DVS247
01:15:51,00 --> 01:15:58,50
They smile and lock eyes. SOMEONE<Olive> bashfully drops her gaze. 

EASY_A_DVS248
01:16:02,00 --> 01:16:08,50
Knitting her brow, she shakes her head. SOMEONE<Todd> blinks. 

EASY_A_DVS249
01:16:44,00 --> 01:16:50,50
She unbuckles her seat belt and they share a tight embrace. 

EASY_A_DVS250
01:16:47,00 --> 01:16:52,50
SOMEONE<Todd> buries his face in her shoulder. 

EASY_A_DVS251
01:16:49,00 --> 01:16:55,50
As she pulls away, he holds on to her hand. 

EASY_A_DVS252
01:16:56,00 --> 01:17:03,50
She pulls it away, and opens the door. Then swings her long slender legs outside. 

EASY_A_DVS253
01:17:01,00 --> 01:17:06,50
She stands and shuts the door behind her, strolling off. 

EASY_A_DVS254
01:17:04,00 --> 01:17:11,50
Facing the car once again, she leans down to peak at SOMEONE<Todd> through the window. 

EASY_A_DVS255
01:17:08,00 --> 01:17:13,50
He rolls it down. And turns off the ignition. 

EASY_A_DVS256
01:17:22,00 --> 01:17:27,50
She cringes, rolling her eyes, then heads off. 

EASY_A_DVS257
01:17:28,00 --> 01:17:33,50
She grins at him over her shoulder. 

EASY_A_DVS258
01:17:56,00 --> 01:18:01,50
The gossipy girl dashes off. 

EASY_A_DVS259
01:18:33,00 --> 01:18:39,50
She crumbles ice-cream cones at the chubby server. 

EASY_A_DVS260
01:18:48,00 --> 01:18:53,50
Micah scratches himself as he reads a Bible. 

EASY_A_DVS262
01:19:33,00 --> 01:19:40,50
SOMEONE<Olive> stares wide-eyed. Mrs. SOMEONE<Griffith> smiles, and shifts in her seat. 

EASY_A_DVS263
01:19:39,00 --> 01:19:46,50
SOMEONE<Olive> hurries out and runs across the quad into Mr. SOMEONE's<Griffith's> classroom. 

EASY_A_DVS264
01:19:55,00 --> 01:20:01,50
SOMEONE's<Olive's> jaw drops and she shakes her head. 

EASY_A_DVS265
01:20:00,00 --> 01:20:05,50
She shifts her horrified gaze. 

EASY_A_DVS266
01:20:05,00 --> 01:20:09,50
Now at her webcam. 

EASY_A_DVS267
01:20:34,00 --> 01:20:39,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Griffith> trudges though campus. 

EASY_A_DVS268
01:20:40,00 --> 01:20:44,50
Nighttime on the ridge. 

EASY_A_DVS269
01:21:19,00 --> 01:21:23,50
SOMEONE<Olive> shows her scarf. 

EASY_A_DVS270
01:21:48,00 --> 01:21:52,50
The mother kisses her daughter's head. 

EASY_A_DVS271
01:21:52,00 --> 01:21:56,50
She cradles SOMEONE<Olive>. 

EASY_A_DVS272
01:22:07,00 --> 01:22:12,50
SOMEONE<Olive> shows a glittery sign to her webcam. 

EASY_A_DVS273
01:22:33,00 --> 01:22:41,50
Now in a packed gym, SOMEONE<Todd> rolls out the wheelbarrow. SOMEONE<Olive> climbs out of the wood in a feather boa. 

EASY_A_DVS274
01:23:04,00 --> 01:23:11,50
She rips off SOMEONE's<Todd's> Woodchuck costume, revealing his blue devil costume. 

EASY_A_DVS275
01:23:12,00 --> 01:23:16,50
They share a grin. 

EASY_A_DVS276
01:23:18,00 --> 01:23:24,50
In the stands, the fundamentalists stare as other students smile and clap. 

EASY_A_DVS277
01:23:25,00 --> 01:23:30,50
SOMEONE<Todd> pumps his fist. 

EASY_A_DVS278
01:23:33,00 --> 01:23:39,50
SOMEONE<Olive> kisses SOMEONE's<Rhiannon's> cheek and gives her the feather boa. 

EASY_A_DVS279
01:23:44,00 --> 01:23:53,50
In a black corset with red stripes, SOMEONE<Olive> bumps her hip at a gawking basketball player. Then smacks a dancer's rear. 

EASY_A_DVS280
01:23:51,00 --> 01:23:59,50
SOMEONE's<Marianne's> jaw drops. SOMEONE<Olive> pulls the slide of a band member's trombone, and poses with SOMEONE<Todd>. 

EASY_A_DVS281
01:24:02,00 --> 01:24:06,50
SOMEONE<Marianne> narrows her eyes. 

EASY_A_DVS283
01:24:19,00 --> 01:24:24,50
Principal Gibbons storms over. 

EASY_A_DVS284
01:24:36,00 --> 01:24:41,50
SOMEONE<Marianne> and SOMEONE<Nina> swap disgusted looks. 

EASY_A_DVS285
01:24:39,00 --> 01:24:44,50
SOMEONE<Olive> takes SOMEONE's<Todd's> arm and scampers out with him. 

EASY_A_DVS286
01:24:41,00 --> 01:24:49,50
Later she faces her webcam as her classmates, teachers, and family watch her webcast. 

EASY_A_DVS287
01:25:15,00 --> 01:25:23,50
SOMEONE<Olive> peeks outside, and finds SOMEONE<Todd> standing on a lawnmower holding a pair of speakers. 

EASY_A_DVS288
01:25:39,00 --> 01:25:44,50
She faces her webcam once again. 

EASY_A_DVS289
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:57,50
Her brother stares, listening in. 

EASY_A_DVS290
01:26:07,00 --> 01:26:13,50
The webcast shows her grin and trod out the door. 

EASY_A_DVS291
01:26:17,00 --> 01:26:22,50
The pastor frowns at his laptop. 

EASY_A_DVS292
01:26:20,00 --> 01:26:26,50
SOMEONE<Evan> watches on a cellphone and a truck almost hits him. 

EASY_A_DVS293
01:26:23,00 --> 01:26:27,50
He hurls ice cream at it. 

EASY_A_DVS294
01:26:26,00 --> 01:26:31,50
Now, Mr. SOMEONE<Griffith> stares steadily at his laptop. 

EASY_A_DVS295
01:26:29,00 --> 01:26:35,50
His wife smiles at him, but he ignores her. 

EASY_A_DVS296
01:26:32,00 --> 01:26:37,50
She sheepishly sucks her lips and heads off. 

EASY_A_DVS297
01:26:35,00 --> 01:26:39,50
Mr. , SOMEONE watches her go. 

EASY_A_DVS298
01:26:37,00 --> 01:26:43,50
In the gazebo, SOMEONE<Marianne> soberly touches her cross necklace. 

EASY_A_DVS299
01:26:40,00 --> 01:26:48,50
SOMEONE sits at a fountain, staring at a text that reads, "Ri, sorry I lied to you. " 

EASY_A_DVS300
01:26:45,00 --> 01:26:50,50
The busty blonde gazes off tearfully. 

EASY_A_DVS301
01:26:48,00 --> 01:26:53,50
Now in a hotel room, SOMEONE<Brandon> lies in bed. 

EASY_A_DVS302
01:26:50,00 --> 01:26:59,50
His beefy mocha skin boyfriend snuggles up behind him and they watch Huckleberry Finn on a laptop. 

EASY_A_DVS303
01:27:06,00 --> 01:27:14,50
SOMEONE<Brandon> smiles. Now outside, SOMEONE<Olive> leaps into SOMEONE's<Todd's> arms. 

EASY_A_DVS304
01:27:12,00 --> 01:27:19,50
He whirls her around, then sets her down. They share a sweet passionate kiss. 

EASY_A_DVS305
01:27:16,00 --> 01:27:22,50
SOMEONE<Todd> takes SOMEONE's<Olive's> hand, then leads her to the lawnmower. 

EASY_A_DVS306
01:27:19,00 --> 01:27:26,50
She climbs onto the rear grass-bagger as SOMEONE<Todd> takes a seat at the wheel. 

EASY_A_DVS307
01:27:23,00 --> 01:27:29,50
She wraps her arm around his chest and they ride off. 

EASY_A_DVS308
01:27:30,00 --> 01:27:35,50
They wheel slowly across the lawn. 

EASY_A_DVS309
01:27:33,00 --> 01:27:38,50
SOMEONE<Todd> raises an arm victoriously, and so does SOMEONE<Olive>. 

EASY_A_DVS310
01:27:36,00 --> 01:27:40,50
Their image freezes. 

EASY_A_DVS311
01:27:42,00 --> 01:27:48,50
They drive onward, keeping their fists in the air. 

EASY_A_DVS312
01:27:45,00 --> 01:27:51,50
The mower carries them up a tree-lined road on a hill.
