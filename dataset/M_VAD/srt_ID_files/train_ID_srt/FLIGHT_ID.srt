FLIGHT_DVS21
00:02:58,00 --> 00:03:02,50
The woman climbs on the bed. 

FLIGHT_DVS22
00:03:02,00 --> 00:03:07,50
She straddles the man. 

FLIGHT_DVS23
00:03:14,00 --> 00:03:18,50
She puts the joint to his lips. 

FLIGHT_DVS24
00:03:25,00 --> 00:03:30,50
She gets off the bed. 

FLIGHT_DVS25
00:03:32,00 --> 00:03:36,50
He smokes his cigarette. 

FLIGHT_DVS26
00:03:39,00 --> 00:03:44,50
He sits up and snorts a line of cocaine. 

FLIGHT_DVS27
00:03:50,00 --> 00:03:58,50
The man walks out of the room, dressed in a black suit and sporting dark glasses under a pilot's cap. 

FLIGHT_DVS28
00:03:56,00 --> 00:04:01,50
An airplane pin is on his lapel. 

FLIGHT_DVS29
00:04:03,00 --> 00:04:09,50
People run across the tarmac, as rain lashes the airport. 

FLIGHT_DVS30
00:04:06,00 --> 00:04:11,50
Lightning flashes in the distance. 

FLIGHT_DVS32
00:04:14,00 --> 00:04:19,50
The man, now in a raincoat, walks under a parked South Jet airplane. 

FLIGHT_DVS34
00:04:18,00 --> 00:04:22,50
He pauses near one of the wheels, opens his mouth, and sprays some mouth freshener. 

FLIGHT_DVS36
00:04:25,00 --> 00:04:33,50
He trots to the mobile stairway leading to the passenger walkway, and slips on the first step. 

FLIGHT_DVS37
00:04:31,00 --> 00:04:36,50
He joins the passengers through a side door. 

FLIGHT_DVS38
00:05:13,00 --> 00:05:18,50
Whitaker sits next to his copilot. 

FLIGHT_DVS39
00:05:38,00 --> 00:05:43,50
SOMEONE<Whip> inhales the oxygen. 

FLIGHT_DVS40
00:05:57,00 --> 00:06:02,50
SOMEONE<Whip> fidgets on his side of the cockpit. 

FLIGHT_DVS41
00:06:07,00 --> 00:06:13,50
Ken watches as SOMEONE<Whip> brushes his hair. 

FLIGHT_DVS42
00:06:33,00 --> 00:06:40,50
A woman steps out of a room at Hotel Atlanta, carrying a folded up massage table. 

FLIGHT_DVS43
00:06:38,00 --> 00:06:44,50
She wears a dress, and has a small tattoo on her shoulder. 

FLIGHT_DVS44
00:06:42,00 --> 00:06:47,50
She pulls some bills from a bundle of cash. 

FLIGHT_DVS45
00:06:51,00 --> 00:06:57,50
She walks to a car and places the massage table in the trunk. 

FLIGHT_DVS46
00:06:54,00 --> 00:07:00,50
She smokes as she makes a call from the driverâ€™s seat. 

FLIGHT_DVS47
00:07:05,00 --> 00:07:11,50
She leans on the steering wheel, and lowers the phone to the passenger seat. 

FLIGHT_DVS48
00:07:16,00 --> 00:07:20,50
A man snorts coke. 

FLIGHT_DVS49
00:07:30,00 --> 00:07:35,50
He looks SOMEONE<Nicole> over. 

FLIGHT_DVS50
00:08:02,00 --> 00:08:06,50
SOMEONE<Brad> drops his towel. 

FLIGHT_DVS51
00:08:43,00 --> 00:08:48,50
He holds a small square. 

FLIGHT_DVS52
00:09:27,00 --> 00:09:31,50
SOMEONE<Margaret> sits facing SOMEONE<Trina>. 

FLIGHT_DVS53
00:09:35,00 --> 00:09:40,50
Pushes the side stick forward. 

FLIGHT_DVS54
00:09:45,00 --> 00:09:49,50
The cockpit shakes. 

FLIGHT_DVS55
00:09:59,00 --> 00:10:03,50
SOMEONE<Whip> takes the yoke and pulls back. 

FLIGHT_DVS56
00:10:04,00 --> 00:10:08,50
They ascend. 

FLIGHT_DVS57
00:10:39,00 --> 00:10:45,50
The plane shakes, and items fall from the overhead bins. 

FLIGHT_DVS58
00:10:48,00 --> 00:10:54,50
Ken casts an uneasy sideways glance at SOMEONE<Whip>. 

FLIGHT_DVS59
00:12:15,00 --> 00:12:21,50
SOMEONE<Whip> eyes the horizon as he steers the plane through rough air. 

FLIGHT_DVS60
00:12:21,00 --> 00:12:26,50
He moves the side stick forward. 

FLIGHT_DVS61
00:12:29,00 --> 00:12:35,50
The altimeter slides quickly to the right as the plane rises. 

FLIGHT_DVS62
00:12:41,00 --> 00:12:48,50
They reach a clearing, through clouds and bright sunlight, as SOMEONE<Whip> levels out. 

FLIGHT_DVS63
00:12:54,00 --> 00:13:00,50
SOMEONE<Trina> smiles, and looks at the passengers from her jump seat. 

FLIGHT_DVS64
00:13:01,00 --> 00:13:06,50
SOMEONE<Whip> takes the phone. 

FLIGHT_DVS65
00:13:05,00 --> 00:13:12,50
A car speeds past a sign that reads Georgian Gardens, and stops. 

FLIGHT_DVS66
00:13:14,00 --> 00:13:22,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> gets out of the car, and runs up to the second floor of a small, run-down apartment complex. 

FLIGHT_DVS67
00:13:23,00 --> 00:13:30,50
She pulls out a key as she reaches the door, only to discover it is slightly open. 

FLIGHT_DVS68
00:14:08,00 --> 00:14:13,50
She smiles at him. 

FLIGHT_DVS69
00:14:16,00 --> 00:14:20,50
He stands in the doorway. 

FLIGHT_DVS70
00:14:19,00 --> 00:14:24,50
She kicks the door closed. 

FLIGHT_DVS71
00:14:35,00 --> 00:14:42,50
She flings her bag on a table and it hits a box, which falls and scatters its contents. 

FLIGHT_DVS72
00:14:39,00 --> 00:14:43,50
She spots a syringe. 

FLIGHT_DVS73
00:14:48,00 --> 00:14:52,50
SOMEONE<Whip> speaks into the intercom. 

FLIGHT_DVS74
00:14:56,00 --> 00:15:04,50
He pours the contents of a small vodka bottle into a juice container, hidden from the passenger's view. 

FLIGHT_DVS75
00:15:28,00 --> 00:15:34,50
He tosses three miniature bottles as he grabs the spiked orange juice. 

FLIGHT_DVS77
00:15:33,00 --> 00:15:39,50
He takes a long drink as SOMEONE<Margaret> exits the toilet, and he goes in. 

FLIGHT_DVS79
00:15:43,00 --> 00:15:49,50
In SOMEONE's<Nicole's> apartment, framed photographs on the table show a younger, smiling SOMEONE<Nicole> with her mother. 

FLIGHT_DVS80
00:15:47,00 --> 00:15:52,50
SOMEONE lightly taps the syringe, 

FLIGHT_DVS81
00:15:50,00 --> 00:15:56,50
then pushes out a small drop that slides down the needle. 

FLIGHT_DVS82
00:15:53,00 --> 00:15:58,50
She tightens a tourniquet around her arm, and holds the end securely in her mouth. 

FLIGHT_DVS83
00:15:56,00 --> 00:16:01,50
She positions the needle and injects. 

FLIGHT_DVS86
00:16:07,00 --> 00:16:12,50
Her arms relax and she lets go of the syringe. 

FLIGHT_DVS88
00:16:14,00 --> 00:16:18,50
She leans back, eyes closed. 

FLIGHT_DVS89
00:16:16,00 --> 00:16:20,50
The strap falls from her mouth. 

FLIGHT_DVS90
00:16:24,00 --> 00:16:29,50
Her head lolls to her shoulder. 

FLIGHT_DVS91
00:16:33,00 --> 00:16:38,50
Her dilated pupils shrink to tiny dots. 

FLIGHT_DVS92
00:16:39,00 --> 00:16:45,50
She grabs the packet of cocaine that Kip gave her, and falls on her side. 

FLIGHT_DVS93
00:16:45,00 --> 00:16:50,50
The packet falls, inches from her hand. 

FLIGHT_DVS94
00:16:47,00 --> 00:16:51,50
Her fingers reach out, but only push it away. 

FLIGHT_DVS96
00:16:54,00 --> 00:16:58,50
Her hand goes still, as feet appear under the door. 

FLIGHT_DVS99
00:17:08,00 --> 00:17:15,50
In the cockpit, SOMEONE<Whip> sleeps with paper covering his eyes, and his sunglasses over the paper. 

FLIGHT_DVS100
00:17:36,00 --> 00:17:40,50
Ken's yoke jerks away. 

FLIGHT_DVS101
00:17:56,00 --> 00:18:04,50
The yoke slips out of Ken's hands as SOMEONE<Whip> struggles to gain control, and the plane begins to dive. 

FLIGHT_DVS102
00:18:52,00 --> 00:18:59,50
The wheels of the aircraft unfold. In the galley, SOMEONE<Margaret> grabs the phone. 

FLIGHT_DVS103
00:20:04,00 --> 00:20:09,50
SOMEONE<Margaret> unbuckles her seatbelt. 

FLIGHT_DVS104
00:20:22,00 --> 00:20:30,50
Alarmed passengers grasp the seat in front of them, as a flight attendant tries to assist someone. 

FLIGHT_DVS105
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:07,50
SOMEONE<Cammie> falls, and hits her head. 

FLIGHT_DVS106
00:21:06,00 --> 00:21:11,50
SOMEONE<Cammie> lies still. 

FLIGHT_DVS107
00:21:51,00 --> 00:21:56,50
SOMEONE<Whip> banks to the left. 

FLIGHT_DVS109
00:22:02,00 --> 00:22:06,50
The planes turns upside down. 

FLIGHT_DVS111
00:22:08,00 --> 00:22:13,50
She slides the side stick forward. 

FLIGHT_DVS112
00:22:12,00 --> 00:22:17,50
One wheel gets stuck while retracting. 

FLIGHT_DVS113
00:22:15,00 --> 00:22:22,50
Inside the cabin, SOMEONE<Cammie> comes to a rest on the ceiling, and SOMEONE<Trina> sees a young boy slip out of his seat. 

FLIGHT_DVS114
00:22:23,00 --> 00:22:32,50
Outside Georgian Gardens, a medical aide wheels SOMEONE<Nicole> beside Fran, as the upside down plane flies past. 

FLIGHT_DVS115
00:22:55,00 --> 00:23:00,50
SOMEONE<Trina> crawls to the boy, and straps him back in his seat. 

FLIGHT_DVS116
00:23:02,00 --> 00:23:08,50
A light flashes on the control panel in the cockpit. 

FLIGHT_DVS117
00:23:42,00 --> 00:23:49,50
The plane turns upright, and a still unconscious SOMEONE<Cammie> falls on some passengers. 

FLIGHT_DVS118
00:23:56,00 --> 00:24:01,50
SOMEONE<Trina> loses her hold, and falls against the bulkhead. 

FLIGHT_DVS119
00:24:07,00 --> 00:24:12,50
Fire and smoke billow from the left engine. 

FLIGHT_DVS120
00:24:09,00 --> 00:24:15,50
SOMEONE<Trina> tumbles across the galley, as the plane straightens out. 

FLIGHT_DVS121
00:24:21,00 --> 00:24:25,50
Gauges drop. 

FLIGHT_DVS122
00:24:38,00 --> 00:24:44,50
They head towards a church, sitting on an expanse of open land. 

FLIGHT_DVS123
00:24:45,00 --> 00:24:50,50
SOMEONE steers the plane away from the church's steeple, 

FLIGHT_DVS124
00:24:48,00 --> 00:24:52,50
but the wing grazes the top. 

FLIGHT_DVS125
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:12,50
The plane hits the ground. SOMEONE<Debris> flies past the cockpit, as SOMEONE<Whip> bangs his head and passes out. 

FLIGHT_DVS127
00:25:11,00 --> 00:25:17,50
Through blurred vision, SOMEONE<Whip> sees Ken leaning to the side in his seat, as he is dragged out. 

FLIGHT_DVS128
00:25:27,00 --> 00:25:32,50
SOMEONE<Margaret> is slumped next to SOMEONE's<Trina's> still body, her head crushed by a collapsed bulkhead. 

FLIGHT_DVS130
00:25:37,00 --> 00:25:43,50
Smoke blocks SOMEONE's<Whip's> vision, as he is pulled away from the plane. 

FLIGHT_DVS131
00:25:40,00 --> 00:25:46,50
As people in white robes help the passengers, a fire engine arrives. 

FLIGHT_DVS133
00:25:57,00 --> 00:26:03,50
SOMEONE looks up at a female EMT leaning over him, 

FLIGHT_DVS134
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:06,50
then turns towards the black smoke rising from the crash site. 

FLIGHT_DVS135
00:26:05,00 --> 00:26:14,50
The broken off spire from the church lies some distance away from an ambulance, as rescue workers help survivors. 

FLIGHT_DVS137
00:26:16,00 --> 00:26:21,50
In a hospital ward, SOMEONE<Whip> slowly opens his right eye. 

FLIGHT_DVS138
00:26:18,00 --> 00:26:23,50
The other eye is covered by a bandage. 

FLIGHT_DVS139
00:26:24,00 --> 00:26:31,50
He sees a seated man on the TV gesturing, as rescue workers push a stretcher behind him. 

FLIGHT_DVS140
00:26:29,00 --> 00:26:37,50
The tagline reads, Breaking news. SOMEONE<Derek> Hogg, South Jet 227 passenger. 

FLIGHT_DVS141
00:26:35,00 --> 00:26:42,50
A field reporter for Channel 12 News comments live from the site, as lights flicker in the background. 

FLIGHT_DVS142
00:26:45,00 --> 00:26:54,50
On TV, cell phone footage shows the descent of the plane, as it swerves and slices off the church steeple. 

FLIGHT_DVS145
00:26:54,00 --> 00:27:00,50
It glides overhead, both engines on fire, and slams down on its side, as people in white robes run for cover. 

FLIGHT_DVS146
00:27:08,00 --> 00:27:13,50
SOMEONE, his head wrapped in gauze, 

FLIGHT_DVS147
00:27:10,00 --> 00:27:17,50
watches in a daze, as the church folk stand and take in the scene from a distance, 

FLIGHT_DVS148
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:19,50
then slowly approach. 

FLIGHT_DVS149
00:27:21,00 --> 00:27:27,50
SOMEONE<Whip> averts his gaze from the screen, and notices a man in the room. 

FLIGHT_DVS150
00:27:26,00 --> 00:27:33,50
The man wears a suit with a collar open, and is staring intently at his cell phone. 

FLIGHT_DVS151
00:27:34,00 --> 00:27:39,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> turns, and SOMEONE<Whip> smiles. 

FLIGHT_DVS152
00:28:37,00 --> 00:28:46,50
A man walks in wearing an NTSB jacket, followed by a few law officers, a nurse, and a doctor. 

FLIGHT_DVS153
00:28:44,00 --> 00:28:50,50
The NTSB officer places a recorder on SOMEONE's<Whip's> bed. 

FLIGHT_DVS154
00:29:17,00 --> 00:29:21,50
SOMEONE<Whip> nods weakly. 

FLIGHT_DVS155
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:04,50
The doctor leaves. 

FLIGHT_DVS156
00:31:18,00 --> 00:31:23,50
Craig takes his recorder, and leaves with the others, 

FLIGHT_DVS157
00:31:21,00 --> 00:31:25,50
but SOMEONE<Charlie> stays back. 

FLIGHT_DVS158
00:33:03,00 --> 00:33:07,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> smiles. 

FLIGHT_DVS159
00:33:23,00 --> 00:33:27,50
He reaches for a plastic bag. 

FLIGHT_DVS160
00:34:15,00 --> 00:34:19,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> leaves. 

FLIGHT_DVS161
00:34:19,00 --> 00:34:25,50
SOMEONE puts his bandaged hand to his mouth, as tears flow down his face, 

FLIGHT_DVS162
00:34:23,00 --> 00:34:29,50
then shakes his head, and takes his cell phone from the plastic bag. 

FLIGHT_DVS164
00:34:30,00 --> 00:34:35,50
He drops the phone on his stomach. 

FLIGHT_DVS165
00:34:36,00 --> 00:34:47,50
A heavy man with a goatee walks into the hospital, wearing Bermuda shorts and dark glasses, with earphone wires hanging on each side of his head. 

FLIGHT_DVS166
00:34:44,00 --> 00:34:52,50
He strides through the corridors, carrying a bag in his hand, and another slung over his shoulder. 

FLIGHT_DVS167
00:35:00,00 --> 00:35:06,50
He removes his earphones, and leans over the reception desk. 

FLIGHT_DVS168
00:35:08,00 --> 00:35:16,50
He enters SOMEONE's<Whip's> room with a video camera, as a nurse helps SOMEONE<Whip> from the bed, exposing his buttocks. 

FLIGHT_DVS169
00:35:37,00 --> 00:35:41,50
The nurse leaves the room. 

FLIGHT_DVS170
00:38:09,00 --> 00:38:15,50
SOMEONE<Harling> places his hand on SOMEONE's<Whip's> head, and leaves. 

FLIGHT_DVS171
00:38:16,00 --> 00:38:20,50
SOMEONE<Whip> closes his eyes. 

FLIGHT_DVS172
00:38:23,00 --> 00:38:27,50
SOMEONE<Whip> is startled awake. 

FLIGHT_DVS173
00:38:28,00 --> 00:38:34,50
He looks around the dark room, then clicks on the light. 

FLIGHT_DVS174
00:38:38,00 --> 00:38:45,50
He peeks into the corridor, as a nurse walks by the reception desk. 

FLIGHT_DVS175
00:38:47,00 --> 00:38:52,50
He quickly limps down the hall, using a cane. 

FLIGHT_DVS176
00:38:55,00 --> 00:39:01,50
He stops at a door marked Stairwell, third floor, and opens it. 

FLIGHT_DVS177
00:38:59,00 --> 00:39:05,50
He sees SOMEONE<Nicole> sitting on the stairs, smoking a cigarette. 

FLIGHT_DVS178
00:39:14,00 --> 00:39:18,50
She rises, to leave. 

FLIGHT_DVS179
00:39:18,00 --> 00:39:21,50
She sits. 

FLIGHT_DVS180
00:39:26,00 --> 00:39:31,50
SOMEONE<Whip> leans against the wall, facing her. 

FLIGHT_DVS181
00:39:29,00 --> 00:39:32,50
He lights a cigarette. 

FLIGHT_DVS182
00:39:38,00 --> 00:39:42,50
She shakes her head. 

FLIGHT_DVS183
00:39:42,00 --> 00:39:47,50
A patient climbs the stairs. 

FLIGHT_DVS184
00:40:04,00 --> 00:40:08,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> tosses her pack. 

FLIGHT_DVS185
00:40:13,00 --> 00:40:18,50
The gaunt man stands by his IV pole. 

FLIGHT_DVS186
00:41:39,00 --> 00:41:43,50
She shakes her head. 

FLIGHT_DVS187
00:42:08,00 --> 00:42:12,50
She glances at SOMEONE<Whip>. 

FLIGHT_DVS188
00:42:44,00 --> 00:42:49,50
The bald man turns to SOMEONE<Whip>. 

FLIGHT_DVS189
00:43:54,00 --> 00:44:01,50
Cigarette hanging out of his mouth, the man picks up the IV pole and walks downstairs. 

FLIGHT_DVS192
00:45:03,00 --> 00:45:08,50
She wipes a tear from her eye, offers a smile, then stands, and climbs up the stairs. 

FLIGHT_DVS193
00:45:42,00 --> 00:45:51,50
A black Cadillac lurches out of the hospital parking structure, and passes the news crews parked outside. 

FLIGHT_DVS194
00:45:53,00 --> 00:45:58,50
SOMEONE<Harling> opens a beer, and takes a swig. 

FLIGHT_DVS196
00:46:25,00 --> 00:46:29,50
He hands SOMEONE<Whip> a package, a bundle of cash. 

FLIGHT_DVS197
00:46:31,00 --> 00:46:38,50
A car turns onto a dirt driveway and passes a sign that reads, Whitaker Crop Dusting Company. 

FLIGHT_DVS199
00:46:37,00 --> 00:46:42,50
There's a For Sale sign next to it. 

FLIGHT_DVS200
00:46:42,00 --> 00:46:49,50
The car passes a dilapidated shed on the right, and pulls up to a large, older farmhouse. 

FLIGHT_DVS201
00:46:47,00 --> 00:46:51,50
SOMEONE<Whip> stops the car. 

FLIGHT_DVS202

01:30:50,00 --> 01:30:55,50
He sits next to her on the bed. 

FLIGHT_DVS674
01:31:10,00 --> 01:31:14,50
She leans in and their foreheads touch. 

FLIGHT_DVS675
01:31:25,00 --> 01:31:31,50
He kisses her, and she allows him to pull her into an embrace. 

FLIGHT_DVS677
01:31:46,00 --> 01:31:51,50
In the morning, SOMEONE<Whip> lies sleeping on the bed, fully dressed. 

FLIGHT_DVS678
01:31:50,00 --> 01:31:54,50
SOMEONE<Nicole> stands at the bedroom entrance. 

FLIGHT_DVS680
01:31:56,00 --> 01:32:03,50
She leaves an envelope with SOMEONE's<Whip's> name on it, between his lighter and a bottle of whiskey. 

FLIGHT_DVS681
01:32:16,00 --> 01:32:22,50
She carries a suitcase and a basket, and walks away from the house. 

FLIGHT_DVS682
01:32:21,00 --> 01:32:27,50
SOMEONE's<Sheila's> van is parked behind some trees, and SOMEONE<Nicole> puts her things in. 

FLIGHT_DVS683
01:32:33,00 --> 01:32:37,50
The van drives off. 

FLIGHT_DVS684
01:32:43,00 --> 01:32:48,50
He stops as he sees the envelope. 

FLIGHT_DVS685
01:32:45,00 --> 01:32:51,50
He trods over to the table and picks up the envelope.  

FLIGHT_DVS687
01:32:49,00 --> 01:32:54,50
He picks it up and opens it. 

FLIGHT_DVS688
01:32:59,00 --> 01:33:05,50
He reads the letter, using the light from a nearby window. 

FLIGHT_DVS689
01:33:02,00 --> 01:33:08,50
He picks up the bottle, and throws it hard across the room. It explodes against a hanging photo of his son. 

FLIGHT_DVS690
01:33:05,00 --> 01:33:10,50
SOMEONE<Whip> stares at it, motionless. 

FLIGHT_DVS691
01:33:21,00 --> 01:33:29,50
Rain falls steadily as SOMEONE<Whip> sits in the car and pours alcohol into a bottle of juice, and takes a drink. 

FLIGHT_DVS692
01:33:29,00 --> 01:33:34,50
He exits the car, and enters a large hangar. 

FLIGHT_DVS693
01:33:42,00 --> 01:33:50,50
The crashed South Jet aircraft stands almost completely assembled, with parts strewn around beside it. 

FLIGHT_DVS694
01:33:48,00 --> 01:33:53,50
Cabinets and shelves line one side of the building. 

FLIGHT_DVS695
01:33:51,00 --> 01:33:55,50
SOMEONE<Hugh> follows SOMEONE<Charlie> out of the plane. 

FLIGHT_DVS738
01:35:21,00 --> 01:35:25,50
SOMEONE<plane> Cocks his head. 

FLIGHT_DVS768
01:36:48,00 --> 01:36:53,50
SOMEONE<Hugh> turns and walks away. 

FLIGHT_DVS770
01:37:06,00 --> 01:37:12,50
SOMEONE<Whip> speeds down the mud road, splashing slush to the side. 

FLIGHT_DVS771
01:37:09,00 --> 01:37:15,50
He brakes when he sees news crews outside the farm house. 

FLIGHT_DVS772
01:37:18,00 --> 01:37:24,50
Some reporters spot him, so he reverses and drives back onto the main road. 

FLIGHT_DVS773
01:37:33,00 --> 01:37:41,50
He stops opposite a house in a quiet neighborhood, pulling up on the curb, barely missing a fire hydrant. 

FLIGHT_DVS774
01:37:45,00 --> 01:37:49,50
He chugs on the bottle of juice. 

FLIGHT_DVS775
01:37:54,00 --> 01:38:00,50
He steps out of the car, and walks up a foot path to a house. 

FLIGHT_DVS776
01:38:02,00 --> 01:38:08,50
A man watches SOMEONE<Whip> from a parked car, and speaks into his cell phone. 

FLIGHT_DVS777
01:38:12,00 --> 01:38:17,50
SOMEONE's<Whip's> ex-wife opens the door. 

FLIGHT_DVS778
01:38:14,00 --> 01:38:19,50
Her smile fades. 

FLIGHT_DVS807
01:39:43,00 --> 01:39:48,50
SOMEONE<Whip> hugs a struggling SOMEONE<Will>. 

FLIGHT_DVS825
01:40:33,00 --> 01:40:37,50
SOMEONE<Whip> turns off the news. 

FLIGHT_DVS850
01:41:53,00 --> 01:41:57,50
SOMEONE<Whip> lifts his arm. 

FLIGHT_DVS851
01:41:57,00 --> 01:42:04,50
SOMEONE<Whip> walks down a hotel corridor, with SOMEONE<Charlie> holding a can of Coca Cola. 

FLIGHT_DVS852
01:42:01,00 --> 01:42:05,50
They approach a burly man. 

FLIGHT_DVS853
01:42:09,00 --> 01:42:13,50
SOMEONE<Hugh> emerges from a room. 

FLIGHT_DVS854
01:42:28,00 --> 01:42:32,50
SOMEONE<Whip> enters the room. 

FLIGHT_DVS880
01:43:26,00 --> 01:43:30,50
They shake hands. 

FLIGHT_DVS882
01:43:46,00 --> 01:43:51,50
SOMEONE<Whip> looks around the spacious room. 

FLIGHT_DVS883
01:43:56,00 --> 01:44:01,50
He picks up a can of coke, and goes over to the fridge. 

FLIGHT_DVS884
01:44:04,00 --> 01:44:11,50
He finds it stocked with juices and non-alcoholic beverages. 

FLIGHT_DVS886
01:44:13,00 --> 01:44:18,50
He eats a meal alone, in his room. 

FLIGHT_DVS887
01:44:22,00 --> 01:44:27,50
He lies in bed, surfing channels on the TV. 

FLIGHT_DVS888
01:44:40,00 --> 01:44:44,50
He shaves. 

FLIGHT_DVS889
01:44:48,00 --> 01:44:55,50
He tries to open the thick file SOMEONE<Hugh> left for him, and it spreads like an accordion. 

FLIGHT_DVS890
01:44:58,00 --> 01:45:02,50
He abandons it. 

FLIGHT_DVS891
01:45:08,00 --> 01:45:14,50
He sits over the toilet, smoking as the bath fills. 

FLIGHT_DVS892
01:45:21,00 --> 01:45:27,50
The clock shows 2:08 a. m. as he hangs a suit in a wardrobe. 

FLIGHT_DVS893
01:45:40,00 --> 01:45:45,50
He looks around for the source of the knocking. 

FLIGHT_DVS894
01:45:51,00 --> 01:45:57,50
Lying in bed, he's awakened by the same sound. 

FLIGHT_DVS895
01:46:04,00 --> 01:46:10,50
He gets out of bed, and goes to a side door. 

FLIGHT_DVS896
01:46:10,00 --> 01:46:14,50
He holds his ear to it, 

FLIGHT_DVS897
01:46:15,00 --> 01:46:19,50
then pulls it open. 

FLIGHT_DVS898
01:46:22,00 --> 01:46:30,50
The extended lock on a door leading to an adjoining room, bumps repeatedly against a door jam. 

FLIGHT_DVS899
01:46:30,00 --> 01:46:35,50
SOMEONE<Whip> enters the room. 

FLIGHT_DVS900
01:46:38,00 --> 01:46:44,50
A gentle breeze blows through the balcony doors, ruffling drawn curtains. 

FLIGHT_DVS901
01:46:46,00 --> 01:46:51,50
SOMEONE<Whip> walks over and gazes at the skyline. 

FLIGHT_DVS902
01:46:54,00 --> 01:46:59,50
A plane's beacon lights flash in the night sky. 

FLIGHT_DVS903
01:47:02,00 --> 01:47:06,50
SOMEONE turns around, 

FLIGHT_DVS904
01:47:03,00 --> 01:47:08,50
and his eyes fall on a fridge. 

FLIGHT_DVS905
01:47:23,00 --> 01:47:30,50
He opens the door to reveal rows of miniature bottles of alcohol on the shelves. 

FLIGHT_DVS906
01:47:34,00 --> 01:47:39,50
SOMEONE<Whip> squats and looks over the array of spirits. 

FLIGHT_DVS907
01:47:46,00 --> 01:47:50,50
He settles for vodka. 

FLIGHT_DVS909
01:47:58,00 --> 01:48:05,50
Still kneeling, he unscrews the top from the bottle, and runs his fingers over the cold surface of the glass. 

FLIGHT_DVS910
01:48:07,00 --> 01:48:12,50
He brings the bottle to his nose. 

FLIGHT_DVS912
01:48:21,00 --> 01:48:28,50
He replaces the cap, then slowly stands up and sets the bottle on top of the fridge. 

FLIGHT_DVS913
01:48:32,00 --> 01:48:37,50
He closes the fridge door, and walks away. 

FLIGHT_DVS914
01:48:50,00 --> 01:48:55,50
SOMEONE<Whip> swoops up the bottle. 

FLIGHT_DVS915
01:48:54,00 --> 01:49:00,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> exits an elevator, carrying three coffees. 

FLIGHT_DVS916
01:48:57,00 --> 01:49:01,50
SOMEONE<Hugh> follows. 

FLIGHT_DVS918
01:49:07,00 --> 01:49:11,50
The men look at each other. 

FLIGHT_DVS919
01:49:22,00 --> 01:49:26,50
SOMEONE<Hugh> checks the time. 

FLIGHT_DVS920
01:49:33,00 --> 01:49:37,50
Bottles lie everywhere. 

FLIGHT_DVS921
01:49:45,00 --> 01:49:51,50
SOMEONE<Whip> lies face down in the bathroom, a large blood stain on the toilet. 

FLIGHT_DVS934
01:50:35,00 --> 01:50:40,50
SOMEONE<Harling> arrives, a bag slung over his shoulder. 

FLIGHT_DVS935
01:50:53,00 --> 01:50:58,50
SOMEONE<Hugh> jumps back, and SOMEONE<Charlie> raises his hands. 

FLIGHT_DVS936
01:50:58,00 --> 01:51:03,50
SOMEONE<Harling> gestures to SOMEONE<Edmond>. 

FLIGHT_DVS937
01:51:15,00 --> 01:51:19,50
SOMEONE<Hugh> clears the table. 

FLIGHT_DVS938
01:51:26,00 --> 01:51:30,50
SOMEONE<Harling> sits beside SOMEONE<Whip>. 

FLIGHT_DVS939
01:51:51,00 --> 01:51:54,50
He cuts the coke. 

FLIGHT_DVS940
01:52:04,00 --> 01:52:09,50
SOMEONE<Whip> smiles up at SOMEONE<Harling>. 

FLIGHT_DVS941
01:52:06,00 --> 01:52:13,50
A torn piece of toilet paper, with a spot of blood, hangs over his eye. 

FLIGHT_DVS942
01:52:18,00 --> 01:52:22,50
SOMEONE<Hugh> fetches the water. 

FLIGHT_DVS943
01:52:25,00 --> 01:52:30,50
SOMEONE<Harling> prepares the cigarette. 

FLIGHT_DVS944
01:52:33,00 --> 01:52:36,50
SOMEONE<Whip> drinks. 

FLIGHT_DVS945
01:52:41,00 --> 01:52:46,50
SOMEONE<Harling> sucks on the cigarette, and hands it to SOMEONE<Whip>. 

FLIGHT_DVS946
01:52:57,00 --> 01:53:02,50
SOMEONE<Harling> cuts more lines of coke. 

FLIGHT_DVS947
01:53:06,00 --> 01:53:10,50
SOMEONE snorts a line, 

FLIGHT_DVS948
01:53:10,00 --> 01:53:15,50
and offers a hit to SOMEONE<Charlie> and SOMEONE<Hugh>. 

FLIGHT_DVS949
01:53:23,00 --> 01:53:27,50
SOMEONE<Whip> nods. 

FLIGHT_DVS950
01:53:37,00 --> 01:53:42,50
SOMEONE<Whip> enters the bathroom. 

FLIGHT_DVS963
01:54:10,00 --> 01:54:14,50
SOMEONE<Harling> puts on his shades. 

FLIGHT_DVS964
01:54:17,00 --> 01:54:22,50
SOMEONE strides out the room wearing sunglasses, 

FLIGHT_DVS965
01:54:20,00 --> 01:54:25,50
a band aid on his forehead, and dressed in a suit. 

FLIGHT_DVS966
01:54:22,00 --> 01:54:27,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> and SOMEONE<Hugh> follow behind him. 

FLIGHT_DVS967
01:54:30,00 --> 01:54:36,50
They enter an elevator with a woman and a little girl. 

FLIGHT_DVS968
01:54:38,00 --> 01:54:44,50
The girl stares at SOMEONE as SOMEONE hands him a handkerchief, 

FLIGHT_DVS969
01:54:50,00 --> 01:54:55,50
He tilts his head back, and presses the cloth to his nostril. He removes his glasses, and looks at his reflection on the elevator ceiling. 

FLIGHT_DVS971
01:54:58,00 --> 01:55:03,50
He lowers his gaze to the little girl. 

FLIGHT_DVS973
01:55:20,00 --> 01:55:27,50
In the hearing room, cell phone footage of the plane crash is played on a large screen. 

FLIGHT_DVS974
01:55:35,00 --> 01:55:40,50
The cell phone footage ends. 

FLIGHT_DVS1034
01:57:29,00 --> 01:57:33,50
SOMEONE<Whip> shifts in his seat. 

FLIGHT_DVS1053
01:58:34,00 --> 01:58:38,50
SOMEONE<seat> Sips some water. 

FLIGHT_DVS1054
01:58:41,00 --> 01:58:45,50
SOMEONE<Ellen> presses a remote. 

FLIGHT_DVS1055
01:58:51,00 --> 01:58:57,50
She rises and walks around the table at the head of the room. 

FLIGHT_DVS1056
01:58:58,00 --> 01:59:03,50
She projects an image on two giant screens. 

FLIGHT_DVS1084
01:59:50,00 --> 01:59:55,50
SOMEONE<Ellen> faces SOMEONE<Whip> in the middle of the room. 

FLIGHT_DVS1106
02:01:06,00 --> 02:01:13,50
SOMEONE<Ellen> slips on her glasses and checks her notes, as SOMEONE<Whip> glances at SOMEONE<Hugh> and SOMEONE<Charlie>. 

FLIGHT_DVS1115
02:01:31,00 --> 02:01:36,50
The evidence appears onscreen. 

FLIGHT_DVS1133
02:02:19,00 --> 02:02:24,50
SOMEONE<Ellen> nods, and leafs through a file. 

FLIGHT_DVS1146
02:03:03,00 --> 02:03:08,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> and SOMEONE<Hugh> share a glance. 

FLIGHT_DVS1147
02:03:16,00 --> 02:03:22,50
SOMEONE<Whip> gazes at an enlarged photograph of SOMEONE<Katerina> on the screen. 

FLIGHT_DVS1148
02:03:35,00 --> 02:03:41,50
SOMEONE<Whip> rolls his tongue, and looks briefly at SOMEONE<Hugh> and SOMEONE<Charlie>. 

FLIGHT_DVS1149
02:04:04,00 --> 02:04:10,50
SOMEONE<Whip> studies SOMEONE's<Katerina's> smiling face with pressed lips. 

FLIGHT_DVS1150
02:04:11,00 --> 02:04:15,50
He takes a sip of water. 

FLIGHT_DVS1169
02:05:25,00 --> 02:05:31,50
SOMEONE<Whip> looks firmly at SOMEONE<Ellen>, his face shiny with perspiration. 

FLIGHT_DVS1170
02:05:34,00 --> 02:05:38,50
SOMEONE<Whip> looks down, his eyes heavy. 

FLIGHT_DVS1179
02:06:04,00 --> 02:06:08,50
SOMEONE<Ellen> closes her file, and slowly walks to her seat. 

FLIGHT_DVS1181
02:06:15,00 --> 02:06:21,50
A year later, SOMEONE<Whip> sits facing a group of inmates in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. 

FLIGHT_DVS1195
02:07:11,00 --> 02:07:15,50
Some inmates smile. 

FLIGHT_DVS1218
02:08:34,00 --> 02:08:38,50
He shuts his eyes. 

FLIGHT_DVS1223
02:09:06,00 --> 02:09:11,50
A smile plays on his lips. 

FLIGHT_DVS1225
02:09:25,00 --> 02:09:31,50
SOMEONE<Whip> sits, writing at his desk in his cell. 

FLIGHT_DVS1226
02:09:28,00 --> 02:09:33,50
A board hangs above the desk, covered in photographs and cards. 

FLIGHT_DVS1228
02:09:42,00 --> 02:09:48,50
SOMEONE<Whip> closes a bound book, and tosses his glasses on it. 

FLIGHT_DVS1230
02:09:46,00 --> 02:09:51,50
Photos of SOMEONE and SOMEONE, standing next to a Christmas tree. 

FLIGHT_DVS1237
02:10:04,00 --> 02:10:08,50
In between the photos, hangs a copy of the serenity prayer. 

FLIGHT_DVS1241
02:10:12,00 --> 02:10:16,50
a guard punches in a code and a wire gate opens, letting SOMEONE<Whip> through. 

FLIGHT_DVS1242
02:10:17,00 --> 02:10:21,50
SOMEONE<Whip> smiles as he walks towards SOMEONE<Will>, seated at a desk. 

FLIGHT_DVS1244
02:10:24,00 --> 02:10:27,50
They hug. 

FLIGHT_DVS1245
02:10:49,00 --> 02:10:53,50
They're seated at a table. 

FLIGHT_DVS1246
02:11:20,00 --> 02:11:24,50
SOMEONE<Will> opens a writing pad. 

FLIGHT_DVS1247
02:11:22,00 --> 02:11:26,50
SOMEONE<Whip> shifts, his hands resting on the table. 

FLIGHT_DVS1249
02:11:25,00 --> 02:11:29,50
he lowers his eyes. 

FLIGHT_DVS1250
02:11:34,00 --> 02:11:39,50
SOMEONE<Will> turns on his cell phone recorder. 

FLIGHT_DVS1251
02:11:43,00 --> 02:11:47,50
SOMEONE's<Whip's> brow furrows, then he smiles.
