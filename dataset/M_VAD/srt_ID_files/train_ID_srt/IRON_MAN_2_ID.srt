SOMEONE's<Ivan's> orange shirt ignites and falls in tatters around his hips. A red racecar speeds up to SOMEONE<Ivan>, who raises his right arm and slices off the front of the car with a whip. The car explodes into sparks and gray smoke as it spins in the air. The car crashes, flips several times, and breaks apart on the roadway behind SOMEONE<Ivan>.

IRON_MAN_2_DVS183
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:28,50
With his jacket's left sleeve on fire, SOMEONE<Tony> stands and pats the flames, extinguishing them. Smiling, SOMEONE<Ivan> steps through the fiery car SOMEONE<debris> and creeps toward SOMEONE<Tony>. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS184
00:34:31,00 --> 00:34:41,50

IRON_MAN_2_DVS192
00:35:29,00 --> 00:35:38,50
Pepper tosses the red case onto the ground. SOMEONE<Tony> taps the case with his foot. The case opens, converting into a condensed Iron Man suit. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS193
00:35:35,00 --> 00:36:10,50
SOMEONE<Tony> bends over and puts his hands into two gloves inside the suit. As he stands, the suit expands, covering SOMEONE's<Tony's> entire body. Small armored plates pop vertically out of the suit, then fold down to form a layer of protective metal. Other metal plates pop up from behind SOMEONE's<Tony's> neck, and cover his head, to form a red helmet and a silver mask with glowing eyes. With his foot, SOMEONE<Tony> - or Iron Man - pushes the limousine yards away with one foot. Iron Man turns and raises his left hand toward SOMEONE<Ivan>. A glowing circle appears in Iron Man's hand. With his whip, SOMEONE<Ivan> slaps Iron Man's hand downward, then strikes Iron Man's suit. Iron Man lifts his right hand and fires two blasts at SOMEONE<Ivan>, who ducks.

IRON_MAN_2_DVS195
00:36:18,00 --> 00:36:33,50
Waves of electricity pulse through the whip and around Iron Man's suit. Iron Man stands and wraps the whip around his right arm. Approaching SOMEONE<Ivan>, Iron Man wraps the whip around his own suit several times, and punches SOMEONE's<Ivan's> stomach and face. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS196

01:20:52,00 --> 01:20:57,50
"The key to the future is here. " 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS433
01:20:54,00 --> 01:20:59,50
SOMEONE pulls off the sheet, 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS434
01:20:56,00 --> 01:21:03,50
revealing the scale city model propped on its side with the roofs of miniature buildings pointing toward him. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS435
01:21:01,00 --> 01:21:07,50
SOMEONE forms an O with his right hand, and peers through the makeshift scope 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS436
01:21:04,00 --> 01:21:09,50
at the Unisphere in the center of the model. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS437
01:21:07,00 --> 01:21:12,50
He smiles slightly, then furrows his brow. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS438
01:21:11,00 --> 01:21:24,50
Later, the disassembled model, stacked in four panels, rises out of the passenger seat of SOMEONE's<Tony's> convertible, as he drives down a highway. In his basement laboratory, SOMEONE<Tony> blows dust off the assembled model. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS439
01:21:26,00 --> 01:21:32,50
A holographic image of the scale model appears, overlapping the actual model. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS440
01:21:37,00 --> 01:21:42,50
SOMEONE<Tony> lifts the holograph with both hands and turns. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS441
01:21:46,00 --> 01:21:51,50
SOMEONE<Tony> lowers the holograph and pushes it out in front of himself. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS442
01:21:51,00 --> 01:22:01,50
He snaps his fingers, then spins the holograph and sits. As the holograph slows to a stop, it turns sideways. The holograph of Unisphere hovers at eye level. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS443
01:22:07,00 --> 01:22:11,50
The center of the Unisphere. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS444
01:22:10,00 --> 01:22:18,50
The Unisphere glows bright white. SOMEONE<Tony> draws a circle in the air with his finger. As he moves his hands apart, the Unisphere expands. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS445
01:22:15,00 --> 01:22:22,50
He studies the sphere and the surrounding architecture on the holographic model. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS447
01:22:36,00 --> 01:22:42,50
As SOMEONE<Tony> touches and flicks images on the holograph, they disappear. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS448
01:22:47,00 --> 01:22:53,50
Moving his hands, SOMEONE<Tony> expands the Unisphere again. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS449
01:22:50,00 --> 01:22:58,50
Dozens of holographic dots appear and enter the Unisphere. SOMEONE<Tony> pats his thighs, then throws his arms overhead. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS450
01:22:55,00 --> 01:23:01,50
The sphere expands so that SOMEONE<Tony> is sitting inside it. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS451
01:22:58,00 --> 01:23:05,50
Glowing golf ball sized holographic dots radiating pulsing rings float around him. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS452
01:23:17,00 --> 01:23:26,50
SOMEONE<Tony> smiles. As he claps his hands together, the giant element condenses into a single golf ball sized holograph. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS453
01:23:33,00 --> 01:23:41,50
Facing SOMEONE<Tony>, the robotic arm taps its three fingers together. SOMEONE<Tony> smiles, then stands and walks across the room. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS454
01:23:41,00 --> 01:23:46,50
SOMEONE<Tony> swings a sledgehammer and knocks holes in a concrete wall. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS456
01:23:46,00 --> 01:24:00,50
He jackhammers a hole in the floor, exposing an electrical junction box. He connects cables to the box, then breaks a hole through the living room floor above into the ceiling of his laboratory. He drops the cables through the ceiling, down to the lab floor. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS458
01:24:01,00 --> 01:24:10,50
In the lab, he opens a wooden crate containing massive tubes. He takes out the tubes and assembles them. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS459
01:24:12,00 --> 01:24:22,50
Later, he completes the construction of a particle accelerator which incorporates the long tubes. The accelerator extends across the entire house. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS460
01:24:25,00 --> 01:24:32,50
SOMEONE<Coulson> walks downstairs into the basement, punches in the security code, and enters SOMEONE's<Tony's> lab. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS464
01:24:44,00 --> 01:24:49,50
SOMEONE<Coulson> lifts a red, white, and blue shield from a crate. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS465
01:25:01,00 --> 01:25:07,50
As SOMEONE<Coulson> lifts a section of the tubing, SOMEONE<Tony> slides the shield underneath. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS466
01:25:05,00 --> 01:25:11,50
SOMEONE<Tony> places a level atop the section of tubing propped up by the shield. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS467
01:25:29,00 --> 01:25:34,50
They shake hands. SOMEONE<Coulson> leaves. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS468
01:25:33,00 --> 01:25:40,50
Later wearing goggles, SOMEONE<Tony> inserts a prism into the accelerator and activates it. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS469
01:25:37,00 --> 01:25:44,50
Across the room, a circular metal casing houses a triangular core. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS472
01:25:50,00 --> 01:25:56,50
The accelerator shoots beams of light through the prism. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS473
01:25:59,00 --> 01:26:07,50
Using a pipe wrench, SOMEONE<Tony> turns a wheel which rotates the prism, directing the beam outside the tubing. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS474
01:26:04,00 --> 01:26:12,50
Firing from left to right toward the triangular core, the beam burns a line in the wall which drips with flames. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS476
01:26:13,00 --> 01:26:20,50
The beam cuts off the top half of a huge file cabinet as SOMEONE<Tony> points the beam at the center of the core. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS480
01:26:24,00 --> 01:26:32,50
The triangular core glows brighter and brighter inside its casing. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS481
01:26:36,00 --> 01:26:41,50
SOMEONE<Tony> shuts off the accelerator. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS482
01:26:44,00 --> 01:26:50,50
He gazes at the triangle, which contains the glowing element. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS483
01:26:49,00 --> 01:26:53,50
SOMEONE<Tony> approaches the triangle. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS485
01:27:00,00 --> 01:27:06,50
With a pair of tongs, he retrieves the glowing triangle and studies it. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS486
01:27:10,00 --> 01:27:17,50
SOMEONE<Tony> places the triangle inside an arc reactor. The reactor pulses with light. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS487
01:27:25,00 --> 01:27:30,50
At Hammer Industries, SOMEONE<Ivan> works on an arc reactor. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS488
01:27:28,00 --> 01:27:33,50

IRON_MAN_2_DVS495
01:28:44,00 --> 01:28:49,50
and stuffs it in a sack. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS496
01:28:49,00 --> 01:28:53,50
The other man grabs SOMEONE's<Ivan's> pillows. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS497
01:28:52,00 --> 01:28:59,50
The man yanks off SOMEONE's<Ivan's> shoes, revealing letters written on SOMEONE's<Ivan's> bare feet. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS498
01:29:22,00 --> 01:29:27,50

At the Expo, SOMEONE<Rhodey> and the drones chase SOMEONE<Tony> as he speeds over a long line of reflecting pools. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS603
01:43:47,00 --> 01:44:08,50
SOMEONE<Tony> flies faster and faster toward the Unisphere. He enters the Unisphere, bounces off the Eurasian continent, then shoots back out. The drones follow SOMEONE<Tony> inside, crash into continents, and explode. At Hammer Industries, SOMEONE<Natasha> kicks open the door to SOMEONE's<Ivan's> control room. Inside, the two guards hang by their necks from the ceiling. SOMEONE<Happy> follows SOMEONE<Natasha>, who holds two cocked pistols, into the room. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS604
01:44:08,00 --> 01:44:13,50
SOMEONE<Natasha> hurries across the room toward SOMEONE's<Ivan's> computer station. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS605
01:44:10,00 --> 01:44:16,50
Above the Expo grounds, SOMEONE<Tony> flies alone. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS606
01:44:16,00 --> 01:44:32,50
SOMEONE<Rhodey> zooms down and tackles SOMEONE<Tony> in the sky. The men crash through an exhibit's geodesic dome, bounce across rocks at the base of a small waterfall, and land in a shallow stream. SOMEONE<Natasha> types on SOMEONE's<Ivan's> keyboard. SOMEONE<Happy> approaches as data and the outline of a suit pop up on the screen.

01:44:39,00 --> 01:44:48,50
SOMEONE<Natasha> works at the computer. A message appears onscreen: "System Access. " In the dome, the war machine's glowing eyes dim. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS609
01:44:45,00 --> 01:44:52,50
SOMEONE<Rhodey> falls off a small cliff and lands on his back in the stream below.

SOMEONE<Tony> helps SOMEONE<Rhodey> to his feet. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS621
01:46:23,00 --> 01:46:27,50
They walk shoulder to shoulder. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS622
01:46:45,00 --> 01:46:52,50
They turn as a Navy drone lands on the ledge above them. Other military drones drop down and surround them. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS624
01:47:02,00 --> 01:47:08,50
SOMEONE<Tony> and SOMEONE<Rhodey> stand back to back as they glance around at the drones. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS625
01:47:06,00 --> 01:47:12,50
The face plates on SOMEONE's<Tony's> and SOMEONE's<Rhodey's> suits flip back down. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS626
01:47:11,00 --> 01:47:29,50
The drones fire their guns as they charge toward the two men. SOMEONE<Tony> and SOMEONE<Rhodey> fire back, destroying several drones. SOMEONE<Tony> and SOMEONE<Rhodey> shoot and punch more drones as they approach. One drone fires a missile at SOMEONE<Tony>, who dodges it.

IRON_MAN_2_DVS635
01:47:48,00 --> 01:47:56,50
SOMEONE<Rhodey> ducks. SOMEONE<Tony> crosses his wrists and fires a repulsor beam which swivels, hits the remaining drones, and slices a tree in half. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS637
01:48:05,00 --> 01:48:11,50
Uniformed police officers arrive backstage at the arena.

01:48:56,00 --> 01:49:01,50
At SOMEONE's<Ivan's> computer, SOMEONE<Natasha> studies the drone tracker. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS644
01:49:05,00 --> 01:49:15,50
A person wearing a bulky, black armored suit drops inside the dome and lands in front of SOMEONE<Tony> and SOMEONE<Rhodey>. The suit's face plate flips up, revealing SOMEONE's<Ivan's> smiling face. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS648
01:49:20,00 --> 01:49:25,50
Pulse whips shoot out from the arms of SOMEONE's<Ivan's> suit. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS652
01:49:28,00 --> 01:49:43,50
A small missile launcher pops out of SOMEONE's<Rhodey's> left shoulder. It loads the Ex-Wife Missile. A thruster ignites on the back of the missile and launches it toward SOMEONE<Ivan>. The missile strikes SOMEONE's<Ivan's> chest plate and bounces off. It falls into a puddle at SOMEONE's<Ivan's> feet and extinguishes. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS653
01:49:41,00 --> 01:49:45,50
The launcher retracts. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS654
01:49:43,00 --> 01:49:47,50
Grinning, SOMEONE<Ivan> takes one step forward. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS655
01:49:45,00 --> 01:50:04,50
Using the computer screen in his helmet, SOMEONE<Tony> targets SOMEONE<Ivan>. Guns pop out of SOMEONE's<Tony's> shoulders and fire as SOMEONE's<Ivan's> face plate flips down. Swinging the pulse whips, SOMEONE<Ivan> lashes the ground in front of SOMEONE<Tony> and SOMEONE<Rhodey>. SOMEONE<Rhodey> fires his Gatling gun at SOMEONE<Ivan>, who slices the gun off SOMEONE's<Rhodey's> shoulder with a pulse whip. SOMEONE<Tony> rockets upward. SOMEONE<Ivan> lassos SOMEONE<Tony> and slings him against a rock. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS656
01:50:02,00 --> 01:50:10,50
SOMEONE<Rhodey> runs sideways and fires at SOMEONE<Ivan>. SOMEONE<Tony> leaps out of the way as a drone fires a missile then explodes near SOMEONE<Tony>.

SOMEONE<Tony> and SOMEONE<Rhodey> each lift a hand toward each other. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS671
01:50:54,00 --> 01:51:10,50
They fire repulsor blasts, which meet where SOMEONE<Ivan> stands and form a fiery ball that explodes. Lying on the charred ground, SOMEONE<Tony> and SOMEONE<Rhodey> stand. They walk over to SOMEONE<Ivan>, also on the ground. SOMEONE<Ivan> opens his eyes. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS673
01:51:27,00 --> 01:51:33,50
SOMEONE<Tony> and SOMEONE<Rhodey> glance down as SOMEONE's<Ivan's> arc reactor blinks.

01:51:30,00 --> 01:51:35,50
The arc reactors on the defeated drones also blink. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS675
01:51:38,00 --> 01:51:50,50
SOMEONE<Tony> and SOMEONE<Rhodey> rocket up through the dome's roof. SOMEONE<Tony> zooms toward the front steps of the arena, where Pepper stands near a wrecked drone. The drone's arc reactor blinks faster and faster. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS676
01:51:47,00 --> 01:51:58,50
Pepper tilts her head and, frowning, stares at the drone's flashing reactor. SOMEONE<Tony> speeds down, picks up Pepper, and zooms off as the nearby drone, as well as the other drones, explode. 

IRON_MAN_2_DVS678
01:51:59,00 --> 01:52:06,50
