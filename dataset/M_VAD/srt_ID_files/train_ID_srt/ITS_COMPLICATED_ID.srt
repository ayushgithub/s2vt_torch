ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS5
00:02:49,00 --> 00:02:54,50
She swaps a look with her copper-haired friend. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS6
00:03:28,00 --> 00:03:32,50
SOMEONE's<Jane's> friend joins her. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS7
00:03:44,00 --> 00:03:48,50
As they hug, SOMEONE<Jane> eyes SOMEONE<Jake>. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS8
00:03:54,00 --> 00:03:59,50
SOMEONE glances over his shoulder and watches as SOMEONE 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS9
00:04:01,00 --> 00:04:10,50
Now, a young woman carries a box across the well-kept lawn of the Spanish-style home and drops it in the trunk of a hatchback. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS10
00:04:13,00 --> 00:04:17,50
A guy lugs over a suitcase. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS11
00:04:18,00 --> 00:04:22,50
An SUV approaches. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS12
00:04:23,00 --> 00:04:27,50
Purses her lips as SOMEONE<Jane> pulls. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS13
00:05:22,00 --> 00:05:26,50
SOMEONE<Gabby> hugs her mother. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS14
00:05:25,00 --> 00:05:30,50
The older daughter swaps a look with her boyfriend. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS15
00:05:30,00 --> 00:05:33,50
Hug. The oldest 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS16
00:05:32,00 --> 00:05:37,50
good-naturedly, then hugs SOMEONE<Gabby>. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS17
00:05:55,00 --> 00:06:00,50
Her daughters wait anxiously. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS18
00:06:02,00 --> 00:06:06,50
SOMEONE<Gabby> climbs into her car. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS19
00:06:08,00 --> 00:06:12,50
She reads a text. She mimes texting. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS21
00:06:23,00 --> 00:06:31,50
As SOMEONE<Gabby> disappears down the long driveway her sister's boyfriend wraps his arm around SOMEONE<Jane>. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS22
00:06:44,00 --> 00:06:49,50
As she starts toward the house, 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS23
00:06:46,00 --> 00:06:51,50
pauses and waves at the departing couple. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS24
00:06:52,00 --> 00:06:58,50
A black SUV heads down the tree-lined graveled driveway. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS25
00:06:56,00 --> 00:07:28,50
Left alone, SOMEONE<Jane> gazes at her picturesque house. Now, she enters through the front door and sets her purse on a chair beside it. She unwraps a white shawl from her shoulders, tosses it on to a dining room chair, and removes an earring. To her left, a wide archway opens into the kitchen. As she takes out the other earring she notices uncleared plates on the kitchen island. Shaking her head she strolls over. She nibbles a piece of food from a plate as she carries it to the sink. Her eyes shift thoughtfully as she rinses the plate and looks out a window. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS26
00:07:30,00 --> 00:07:40,50
She averts her dejected gaze, then shakes her head dismissively, wipes the tears from her eyes, and resumes clearing the plates. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS27
00:08:01,00 --> 00:08:05,50
She notices the line of customers. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS28
00:08:04,00 --> 00:08:09,50
She refills a water glass. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS29
00:08:07,00 --> 00:08:12,50
Moving down the counter she pauses at a server. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS30
00:08:12,00 --> 00:08:17,50
She stops in front of a white-haired man. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS31
00:08:21,00 --> 00:08:25,50
They shake hands. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS32
00:08:25,00 --> 00:08:29,50
SOMEONE<Jane> and SOMEONE<Adam> shake hands. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS33
00:08:34,00 --> 00:08:39,50
In an office, they roll out the blueprint. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS34
00:08:43,00 --> 00:08:48,50
SOMEONE<Jane> dons her reading glasses. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS35
00:08:49,00 --> 00:08:53,50
Peter trade an eyebrow raise. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS36
00:09:03,00 --> 00:09:08,50
She glances at SOMEONE<Adam>. He smiles. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS37
00:09:11,00 --> 00:09:16,50
She takes off her glasses. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS38
00:09:18,00 --> 00:09:23,50
She eyes SOMEONE<Adam>. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS39
00:09:26,00 --> 00:09:30,50
Shakes his hand again. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS40
00:10:09,00 --> 00:10:14,50
SOMEONE<Adam> shifts his eyes. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS41
00:10:22,00 --> 00:10:30,50
In a doctor's examining room, SOMEONE<Jane> crosses her jittery legs. She begins to fiddle with a piece of equipment. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS42
00:10:45,00 --> 00:10:49,50
The doctor sits across from her. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS43
00:11:23,00 --> 00:11:28,50
He holds a measuring tool to her brow. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS45
00:12:21,00 --> 00:12:25,50
SOMEONE<Jake> and his lover step on. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS46
00:12:47,00 --> 00:12:52,50
eyelid up with her ring finger SOMEONE notices a fertility 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS47
00:12:51,00 --> 00:12:56,50
hand, they share an awkward look. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS48
00:13:01,00 --> 00:13:06,50
SOMEONE<Jake> averts his embarrassed gaze. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS49
00:13:11,00 --> 00:13:15,50
climbs on his head. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS50
00:13:16,00 --> 00:13:21,50
Nighttime, SOMEONE and three friends 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS51
00:14:44,00 --> 00:14:48,50
One girl friend rubs her back. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS52
00:15:30,00 --> 00:15:35,50
SOMEONE<Jane> thoughtfully lifts her wineglass. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS55
00:16:08,00 --> 00:16:12,50
Later, they cross the hotel lobby. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS56
00:16:25,00 --> 00:16:29,50
SOMEONE<Jane> shakes her head. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS57
00:16:59,00 --> 00:17:04,50
SOMEONE<Jane> nods meekly. SOMEONE<Luke> gives her a squeeze. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS58
00:17:11,00 --> 00:17:16,50
SOMEONE<Luke> glances at the counter. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS59
00:17:25,00 --> 00:17:39,50
Alone in an elevator, a smiling couple hurries in as the doors close. SOMEONE<Jane> watches out of the corner of her eye as the older man whispers in the younger woman's ear. The woman laughs and her lover runs a hand down her back. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS60
00:17:37,00 --> 00:17:45,50
SOMEONE<Jane> uncomfortably arches her brows, then gives a sad blink and gazes at the ceiling. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS61
00:17:43,00 --> 00:17:49,50
Hotel room, she lies on a bed then resolutely sits up. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS64
00:18:05,00 --> 00:18:09,50
The bartender sets down a cocktail 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS66
00:18:35,00 --> 00:18:38,50
over and takes a seat 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS67
00:18:59,00 --> 00:19:04,50
She gives an amused smirk. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS68
00:19:11,00 --> 00:19:15,50
SOMEONE<Jane> purses her lips. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS70
00:21:45,00 --> 00:21:53,50
SOMEONE<Jake> flops on to a bed his shirt hanging open. SOMEONE<Jane> lies ravished next to him

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS71
00:21:54,00 --> 00:21:59,50
as the rumbled sheets covering her crotch. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS72
00:22:35,00 --> 00:22:41,50
She jogs into the bathroom holding a pillow over her rear and kicks the door shut. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS73
00:22:39,00 --> 00:22:45,50
SOMEONE<Jake> follows finding her crouched by the toilet. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS76
00:23:30,00 --> 00:23:38,50
It shows assembled guests. SOMEONE<Jane> wipes tears from her eyes then leans toward SOMEONE<Gabby>. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS78
00:23:54,00 --> 00:23:58,50
SOMEONE<Jane> whistles. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS80
00:24:02,00 --> 00:24:11,50
SOMEONE<Jane> glances at her ex-husband who cocks his head and offers a tender smile. SOMEONE's<Jane's> own smile falters. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS81
00:24:15,00 --> 00:24:22,50
Now, in a chic restaurant, SOMEONE's<Jane's> oldest daughter returns to her family's table. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS82
00:24:30,00 --> 00:24:35,50
her oldest notices. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS83
00:25:09,00 --> 00:25:15,50
He tears up. SOMEONE<Jane> bulks dubiously. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS84
00:25:16,00 --> 00:25:20,50
He lifts his glass. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS85
00:25:56,00 --> 00:26:00,50
SOMEONE's<Jane's> face softens. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS86
00:26:19,00 --> 00:26:29,50
SOMEONE<Jake> rumples his lips into a grin. SOMEONE's<Jane's> pensive gaze drifts. SOMEONE<Gabby> glances tearfully at her sister who looks to her fiance. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS87
00:26:28,00 --> 00:26:32,50
SOMEONE lifts his glass, 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS88
00:26:30,00 --> 00:26:38,50
his family sips their champagne. Now, at the hotel's front desk the clerk gives SOMEONE<Jane> and SOMEONE<Jake> their bills. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS89
00:26:39,00 --> 00:26:45,50
SOMEONE<Jane> eyeballs him, then faces their children. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS90
00:26:46,00 --> 00:26:51,50
SOMEONE<Jake> answers his cell. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS91
00:27:00,00 --> 00:27:04,50
SOMEONE<Jake> ends his call. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS92
00:27:29,00 --> 00:27:36,50
waits at the end of the line. SOMEONE<Jane> frowns and swallows. He kisses her cheek. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS93
00:27:35,00 --> 00:27:40,50
Now, SOMEONE<Adam> drives his car. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS94
00:27:54,00 --> 00:27:59,50
SOMEONE<Adam> stops the car and rolls down his window. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS95
00:27:57,00 --> 00:28:02,50
Wearing earbuds she halts quizzically. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS96
00:28:12,00 --> 00:28:17,50
She gets in. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS97
00:28:23,00 --> 00:28:31,50
He and SOMEONE<Jane> share an awkward smile. She faces forward and chuckles. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS98
00:29:08,00 --> 00:29:12,50
In her graveled courtyard they stand. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS99
00:29:30,00 --> 00:29:35,50
He muses slack-jawed. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS100
00:30:26,00 --> 00:30:30,50
He narrows his eyes. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS101
00:30:47,00 --> 00:30:52,50
SOMEONE<Adam> heads off, SOMEONE<Jane> shakes her head. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS102
00:30:52,00 --> 00:31:00,50
SOMEONE<Adam> looks over his shoulder. He sees SOMEONE<Jake> rub SOMEONE's<Jane's> back, the SOMEONE<Jane> side steps away. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS103
00:31:48,00 --> 00:31:53,50
She swaps up the water cooler jug. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS104
00:32:42,00 --> 00:32:46,50
She eyeballs him. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS105
00:33:36,00 --> 00:33:41,50
He goes to kiss her then picks her up instead. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS106
00:33:40,00 --> 00:33:44,50
when the lawn sprinklers springs to 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS107
00:33:44,00 --> 00:33:52,50
Later in bed, SOMEONE<Jane> lies curled up covering her eyes, beside her SOMEONE<Jake> beams. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS108
00:34:21,00 --> 00:34:25,50
He leans in and kisses her. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS109
00:34:23,00 --> 00:34:28,50
They share a mischievous grin. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS110
00:34:26,00 --> 00:34:31,50
SOMEONE<Jane> holds up her hands. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS111
00:34:39,00 --> 00:34:44,50
blanket and rolls on top of her. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS112
00:34:46,00 --> 00:34:52,50
With their feet sticking out from under the blanket he rolls to her other side. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS113
00:34:57,00 --> 00:35:01,50
He kisses her shoulder. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS114
00:34:59,00 --> 00:35:05,50
Smiling at each other they press their foreheads together. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS115
00:35:09,00 --> 00:35:19,50
She watches as he gets out of bed. Wearing only boxers SOMEONE<Jake> grabs his shirt then faces her and slaps his ample belly. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS116
00:35:26,00 --> 00:35:30,50
He hands her a robe. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS117
00:35:30,00 --> 00:35:34,50
She twirls her finger. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS118
00:35:38,00 --> 00:35:42,50
He eyes her quizzically. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS119
00:35:42,00 --> 00:35:47,50
She pleadingly gestures him around. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS120
00:35:56,00 --> 00:36:00,50
He tucks in his shirt. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS121
00:36:34,00 --> 00:36:39,50
She sits on the edge of the bed. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS122
00:36:55,00 --> 00:36:59,50
He fixes his tie. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS123
00:37:18,00 --> 00:37:22,50
She glares at him. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS125
00:38:19,00 --> 00:38:24,50
She bashfully rumples her lips. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS126
00:38:23,00 --> 00:38:28,50
Her stunned friends stare. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS127
00:41:10,00 --> 00:41:14,50
SOMEONE waits in her yard where two ladders 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS128
00:41:25,00 --> 00:41:29,50
She looks over his work. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS129
00:41:44,00 --> 00:41:49,50
He unhooks a strand of blue tape. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS130
00:41:59,00 --> 00:42:06,50
She wanders into the middle of the taped off area, glances around then faces him. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS131
00:42:11,00 --> 00:42:18,50
Now they climb the two ladders, SOMEONE<Adam> gently guides her with a protective hand on her back. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS132
00:42:22,00 --> 00:42:28,50
look out over her Spanish-tiled roof to the tree-filled horizon. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS133
00:42:26,00 --> 00:42:30,50
SOMEONE<Jane> takes out her cell. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS134
00:42:28,00 --> 00:42:35,50
reads SOMEONE<Jake>, she glances at SOMEONE<Adam>, shuts off the phone, then stumbles. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS135
00:42:36,00 --> 00:42:42,50
They smile out at the view. Now in a bathroom, 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS136
00:42:43,00 --> 00:42:56,50
Fully clothed SOMEONE<Jake> puts his phone in his pocket, steps out of the shower, and shuts its glass door. He turns off the running sink faucet, then glances at the mirror, and checks his watch. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS137
00:42:58,00 --> 00:43:04,50
Grimacing, he opens the door. SOMEONE<Pedro> waits outside. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS138
00:43:19,00 --> 00:43:23,50
SOMEONE<Agnes> storms up. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS139
00:43:38,00 --> 00:43:47,50
Nighttime, SOMEONE<Jane> removes a tray of two thick cheese-topped slices of bread from the oven. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS140
00:44:07,00 --> 00:44:12,50
They sit side-by-side at the kitchen island. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS141
00:45:57,00 --> 00:46:00,50
By the hedge and spies 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS142
00:47:25,00 --> 00:47:30,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Adam> gathers his blueprints. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS143
00:47:48,00 --> 00:47:53,50
They share an uncomfortable smile and shift awkwardly. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS145
00:48:01,00 --> 00:48:09,50
She waves back and SOMEONE<Adam> continues to his car. SOMEONE<Jane> smiles and shuts the door. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS146
00:48:08,00 --> 00:48:14,50
She strolls back into the kitchen brushing her hair with her fingers. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS147
00:48:16,00 --> 00:48:22,50
She hurries back and opens the door but finds SOMEONE<Jake> on the porch. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS148
00:48:24,00 --> 00:48:28,50
He slides in and grabs her waist. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS149
00:48:55,00 --> 00:49:00,50
She eyes him skeptically, 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS150
00:49:44,00 --> 00:49:54,50
smiles and shakes her head. Later, SOMEONE<Jane> reclines in a bubble bath while SOMEONE<Jake> sits on the floor leaning on the tub eating ice cream. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS151
00:50:12,00 --> 00:50:17,50
She squeezes water out of a washcloth. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS152
00:50:29,00 --> 00:50:33,50
She flicks water at him. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS153
00:50:38,00 --> 00:50:42,50
He sets his dish on the floor. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS154
00:51:33,00 --> 00:51:37,50
He points his spoon at the dish. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS155
00:51:38,00 --> 00:51:43,50
She drapes the cloth over her chest. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS156
00:51:52,00 --> 00:51:56,50
He mimes smoking. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS157
00:52:18,00 --> 00:52:22,50
drops it in a drawer. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS158
00:52:40,00 --> 00:52:45,50
Now, SOMEONE<Jake> changes a high light bulb. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS160
00:53:14,00 --> 00:53:22,50
He nuzzles her neck then stares lustfully at her. SOMEONE<Jane> gives in her lips meeting his in a sensual mood. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS161
00:53:28,00 --> 00:53:33,50
SOMEONE<Jane> pulls away from him. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS162
00:53:33,00 --> 00:53:38,50
Entering a bedroom she answers a phone. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS163
00:53:36,00 --> 00:53:40,50
She nods at SOMEONE<Jake>. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS164
00:53:39,00 --> 00:53:44,50
As he leans to nuzzle her she scoots away. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS165
00:53:46,00 --> 00:53:50,50
She walks SOMEONE<Jake> to the door. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS166
00:53:57,00 --> 00:54:01,50
She ends the call. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS167
00:54:05,00 --> 00:54:11,50
SOMEONE<Jake> eyes his cell, shows it to SOMEONE<Jane>, and answers. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS168
00:54:11,00 --> 00:54:15,50
his ex and leaves. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS169
00:54:16,00 --> 00:54:20,50
SOMEONE<Jane> smiles after him. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS170
00:54:19,00 --> 00:54:25,50
SOMEONE<Jake> smirks back at SOMEONE<Jane>. She gapes at him and he shrugs. With a careless wave 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS171
00:54:30,00 --> 00:54:37,50
her smile fades. Shaking her head she lifts her hands. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS172
00:55:12,00 --> 00:55:16,50
They head inside. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS173
00:55:18,00 --> 00:55:22,50
reach his office. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS174
00:55:24,00 --> 00:55:28,50
He lets her in. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS175
00:55:32,00 --> 00:55:37,50
She reaches for her bag then hesitates. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS176
00:55:35,00 --> 00:55:40,50
She digs out her cell phone. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS177
00:55:56,00 --> 00:56:05,50
Screwing her mouth to one side she lowers the phone and looks away. She manages a brief tearful smile and continues. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS178
00:56:56,00 --> 00:57:02,50
Lifting her brow SOMEONE<Jane> gives a wide-eyed nod. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS179
00:57:34,00 --> 00:57:39,50
Smiling she opens her hands in his direction. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS180
00:57:38,00 --> 00:57:57,50
Now at the fertility center, a middle-aged man sits on a waiting room couch texting while a younger woman at his side reads a magazine. Next to them a silver-haired man fills out paperwork beside a gum-smacking blonde. At the end of the row SOMEONE<Jake> sits hunched over a hand to his brow. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS181
00:57:57,00 --> 00:58:04,50
A separate female client smiles. The nurse takes SOMEONE<Jake> to a private room,

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS182
00:58:11,00 --> 00:58:18,50
SOMEONE<Jake> node wryly. As the nurse leaves he sets down his specimen cup. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS183
00:58:16,00 --> 00:58:21,50
He removes his jacket then his trousers. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS184
00:58:20,00 --> 00:58:26,50
As he digs out his cell phone SOMEONE<Jane> tours a farmer's market. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS185
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:44,50
While SOMEONE<Jake> lifts his brow and smiles. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS186
00:58:49,00 --> 00:58:57,50
his arms. Now at a hotel restaurant SOMEONE<Lauren> shares a table with SOMEONE<Harley>, her back's to the lobby. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS187
00:59:05,00 --> 00:59:09,50
SOMEONE<Jake> enters the lobby. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS188
00:59:50,00 --> 00:59:55,50
Boarding an elevator SOMEONE<Jake> and SOMEONE<Jane> make out. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS189
00:59:53,00 --> 01:00:00,50
Now in a suite, a bathrobe-clad SOMEONE<Jane> puts a CD in a player. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS190
01:00:07,00 --> 01:00:16,50
then shakes her head, takes a breath, and steps out from behind the bed. He fidgety hands move to untie her bathrobe 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS191
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:19,50
lower to her side. SOMEONE<Jane> clasps the belt again

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS192
01:00:17,00 --> 01:00:23,50
then changes her mind. As she gazes at a door it open the door. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS193
01:00:22,00 --> 01:00:26,50
with a matching robe. They 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS194
01:00:24,00 --> 01:00:30,50
SOMEONE nervously bites her lip and her ex- 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS195
01:00:27,00 --> 01:00:32,50
husband holds her in a fond gaze. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS196
01:00:35,00 --> 01:00:39,50
She lifts a hand to her chest. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS197
01:00:39,00 --> 01:00:43,50
as she exposes one shoulder. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS198
01:00:41,00 --> 01:00:47,50
As she pulls the robe off her other shoulder she looks up and 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS199
01:00:47,00 --> 01:00:54,50
faces SOMEONE<Jake> and sensually cycles her shoulders. The bathrobe drops around her ankles. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS200
01:00:52,00 --> 01:00:57,50
SOMEONE<Jake> stares admiring and shakes his head. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS201
01:00:59,00 --> 01:01:04,50
Taking a breath SOMEONE<Jane> beams at him. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS202
01:01:03,00 --> 01:01:09,50
with her. He pauses, his smile vanishing. He staggers 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS203
01:01:14,00 --> 01:01:20,50
Downstairs, SOMEONE<Harley> tensely gazes past SOMEONE<Lauren> and the wedding consultant. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS204
01:01:23,00 --> 01:01:30,50
He dashes away, hiding his face with his hand he crosses toward the reception desk. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS205
01:01:35,00 --> 01:01:41,50
SOMEONE<Harley> gawks. Now, the doctor checks SOMEONE's<Jake's> blood pressure. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS206
01:02:02,00 --> 01:02:07,50
SOMEONE<Jake> cocks an eyebrow. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS207
01:02:20,00 --> 01:02:25,50
Wide-eyed, SOMEONE<Jane> shifts her confounded gaze. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS208
01:02:50,00 --> 01:03:00,50
In the lobby, SOMEONE<Lauren> finds SOMEONE<Harley> seated on a bench. Hunched over his hands wrung through his hair he bounces one knee rapidly. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS209
01:03:13,00 --> 01:03:17,50
He sees the doctor signal the clerk thumbs up. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS210
01:03:16,00 --> 01:03:20,50
He hugs her and shakes her.  

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS211
01:03:24,00 --> 01:03:33,50
SOMEONE<Jake> and SOMEONE<Jane> eats soup served on trays as they watch Oprah. SOMEONE<Jake> starts to salt his, but SOMEONE<Jane> takes the shaker away. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS212
01:03:37,00 --> 01:03:41,50
SOMEONE<Jane> smiles at him then sobers. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS213
01:03:39,00 --> 01:03:44,50
She aims the remote at the TV. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS214
01:03:43,00 --> 01:03:48,50
Leaning back against the headboard she faces him. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS215
01:04:03,00 --> 01:04:09,50
SOMEONE<Jake> gazes off pensively and SOMEONE<Jane> looks away. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS216
01:04:16,00 --> 01:04:21,50
Smiling, SOMEONE<Jake> shakes his head. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS217
01:04:19,00 --> 01:04:27,50
SOMEONE<Jane> bites her lip. Resting on the upholstered headboard she thoughtfully scratches her arm. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS218
01:04:26,00 --> 01:04:35,50
Jake’s smile fades and he stares at her. SOMEONE<Jane> looks askance at him then fully meets his gaze. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS219
01:04:47,00 --> 01:04:52,50
She starts to push her tray away then leans back. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS220
01:04:54,00 --> 01:05:08,50
She moves her tray. As she starts to get up SOMEONE<Jake> takes her hand and she waits. Leaning her head back SOMEONE<Jane> wistfully watches his thumb stroke her fingers. The ex’s share a vulnerable gaze 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS221
01:05:08,00 --> 01:05:12,50
then yields a smile. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS222
01:05:11,00 --> 01:05:18,50
Biting her lip she turns away and answers her cell. SOMEONE<Jake> beams fondly as he watches. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS223
01:05:43,00 --> 01:05:48,50
He gives SOMEONE<Jane> a pleading look. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS224
01:05:46,00 --> 01:05:52,50
She grips the phone thoughtfully then raises it to her ear. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS225
01:06:11,00 --> 01:06:24,50
SOMEONE<Adam> ends the call. In the suite, SOMEONE<Jake> hugs SOMEONE<Jane> from behind and kisses her neck. At the firm, SOMEONE<Adam> pulls two tickets from his pocket then faces a young coworker. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS226
01:06:53,00 --> 01:06:58,50
She thoughtfully folds her arms. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS227
01:06:58,00 --> 01:07:03,50
SOMEONE<Jake> kisses her and leaves. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS228
01:07:22,00 --> 01:07:26,50
She admires the spread silky crimson dress. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS230
01:07:33,00 --> 01:07:52,50
In SOMEONE’s<Agnes’s> room a bedside alarm clock reads 8:46. Jakes cell phone rest beside it. Lying tensely on the bed SOMEONE<Jake> eyes his phone and exhales nervously. He surreptitiously takes the phone, creeps toward the door leaving SOMEONE<Agnes> typing on her laptop by a sleeping SOMEONE<Pedro>. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS231
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:55,50
SOMEONE<Jake> freezes then faces her. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS232
01:07:58,00 --> 01:08:02,50
She points at SOMEONE<Pedro>. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS233
01:08:00,00 --> 01:08:08,50
As SOMEONE<Agnes> stretches SOMEONE<Jake> scoops her son off the bed. She shuts her laptop. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS234
01:08:07,00 --> 01:08:12,50
SOMEONE's<Jake's> stunned gaze darts. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS235
01:08:12,00 --> 01:08:26,50
She pulls off her t-shirt and smiles at him in her amply filled black bra. SOMEONE<Jake> manages a nod and hurries out. In SOMEONE's<Pedro's> room he lays the curly-haired boy in bed and tucks him in. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS236
01:08:29,00 --> 01:08:36,50
The child lays it on his chest over his heart and hugs it tightly. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS237
01:08:36,00 --> 01:08:45,50
SOMEONE<Jake> gives a tender smile which fades to a serene look. Sitting on the edge of the boy's bed he leans over his 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS239
01:08:51,00 --> 01:09:05,50
She sits on her kitchen wearing the silky crimson dress. Her legs crossed, she idly bounces her foot, and stares off. She faces the chocolate cake on the island then stands and sets a glass cover over it. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS240
01:09:03,00 --> 01:09:21,50
Adjusting the black belt at her narrow waist she strides out and turns off the kitchen light. On the patio the table remains set with the flowers, dinnerware, and a bottle of wine. Picture windows show SOMEONE<Jane> trudging past and turning off lights in the house. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS241
01:09:23,00 --> 01:09:36,50
As she takes off her earrings she plods down a hall and shuts off its light as well. Daytime, SOMEONE's,<Gabby's,> and SOMEONE<Lauren> and SOMEONE’s<Harley’s> SUVs sit parked in front of SOMEONE's<Jane's> house. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS242
01:10:03,00 --> 01:10:07,50
SOMEONE<Jane> frowns. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS243
01:10:07,00 --> 01:10:11,50
car arrives. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS244
01:10:10,00 --> 01:10:14,50
SOMEONE<arrives> fills his wine glass. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS245
01:10:25,00 --> 01:10:29,50
SOMEONE carries in SOMEONE's bag as SOMEONE 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS246
01:10:30,00 --> 01:10:35,50
notes the five settings on the table. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS247
01:10:38,00 --> 01:10:43,50
As SOMEONE<Jane> blows him off SOMEONE<Harley> gulps his wine. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS248
01:10:42,00 --> 01:10:46,50
She set the roast chicken. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS250
01:10:51,00 --> 01:10:55,50
SOMEONE<Jake> answers his cell. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS251
01:11:00,00 --> 01:11:07,50
SOMEONE<Jane> fans herself. SOMEONE<Jake> ends his call and faces his family. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS252
01:11:38,00 --> 01:11:42,50
SOMEONE<Luke> brings his dad some SOMEONE<olive> oil. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS253
01:11:45,00 --> 01:11:52,50
SOMEONE<Jane> stops carving the chicken and turns in SOMEONE's<Jake's> direction still holding her knife. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS254
01:11:52,00 --> 01:11:56,50
SOMEONE<Harley> takes the knife as she leaves. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS255
01:11:59,00 --> 01:12:05,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Jane> follows her ex onto the patio. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS256
01:12:32,00 --> 01:12:36,50
She tightens her lips. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS257
01:14:05,00 --> 01:14:11,50
SOMEONE<Jane> eyes SOMEONE<Harley> who pleadingly puts his hands up. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS258
01:14:16,00 --> 01:14:25,50
At the front door, SOMEONE<Lauren> hugs and kisses her father goodbye. As SOMEONE<Jake> lingers in the doorway she takes her place at the table. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS259
01:14:30,00 --> 01:14:36,50
SOMEONE<Jake> stares at his family glumly then gives a regretful look. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS260
01:14:40,00 --> 01:14:44,50
She watches SOMEONE through a window. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS261
01:14:46,00 --> 01:14:52,50
He watches her smile. SOMEONE's<Jake's> car speed off. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS263
01:15:19,00 --> 01:15:27,50
Later, SOMEONE<Adam> saunters to her front door carrying a gift. He gives a little hop. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS264
01:15:26,00 --> 01:15:30,50
He rings the bell. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS265
01:15:29,00 --> 01:15:35,50
SOMEONE<Jane> opens the door and peeks out then grins. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS266
01:15:41,00 --> 01:15:46,50
She shows a big slice of chocolate cake. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS267
01:15:48,00 --> 01:15:55,50
He hands her the gift. She digs into her cake then glances at the present. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS268
01:15:54,00 --> 01:15:58,50
She shoves the cake at him. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS269
01:16:16,00 --> 01:16:22,50
She unwraps the slender book with the bright cover. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS270
01:16:39,00 --> 01:16:43,50
She clumsily kisses him. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS271
01:16:44,00 --> 01:16:49,50
He smacks his lips. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS272
01:17:28,00 --> 01:17:31,50
She lose the joint. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS273
01:17:31,00 --> 01:17:36,50
She glances at them and drops it. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS274
01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:42,50
He look over and she waves. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS275
01:17:40,00 --> 01:17:45,50
they nod then drive off. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS276
01:18:15,00 --> 01:18:21,50
Up later outside, guests hurry up.  

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS277
01:18:19,00 --> 01:18:23,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS278
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:27,50
Hide with the joint behind the seven-foot hedge.  

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS279
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:34,50
SOMEONE<Adam> puts it to his lips. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS280
01:18:33,00 --> 01:18:41,50
SOMEONE's<Jane's> jaw drops. He waves the joint in front of his nose and mouth, and inhales more smoke. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS281
01:18:42,00 --> 01:18:46,50
He addresses the joint. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS282
01:18:47,00 --> 01:18:54,50
He takes another hit. On the other side of the hedge a guy walks by. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS283
01:18:56,00 --> 01:19:01,50
She stifles her laughter in the crook of her arm. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS284
01:21:35,00 --> 01:21:39,50
SOMEONE<Adam> mouths wow. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS285
01:21:57,00 --> 01:22:02,50
SOMEONE<Jake> jerks his head and stalks off. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS286
01:22:49,00 --> 01:22:53,50
She lights the joint. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS287
01:22:55,00 --> 01:22:59,50
She puffs out a cloud of smoke. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS288
01:23:14,00 --> 01:23:19,50
SOMEONE<Jane> stares at her reflection in a mirror. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS289
01:23:17,00 --> 01:23:25,50
She widens her eyes. SOMEONE<Jake> blows smoke out of the joint and into SOMEONE's<Harley's> mouth. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS292
01:24:36,00 --> 01:24:41,50
He is pretending to cast a fishing line at her then reels 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS293
01:25:21,00 --> 01:25:26,50
Later in SOMEONE's car, 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS294
01:25:24,00 --> 01:25:29,50
SOMEONE<Jane> disbelievingly shakes her head. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS295
01:25:37,00 --> 01:25:41,50
SOMEONE's<Jane's> lips stutter. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS296
01:25:40,00 --> 01:25:44,50
She hesitates thoughtfully. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS297
01:25:45,00 --> 01:25:49,50
They share a smile. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS298
01:25:51,00 --> 01:25:58,50
SOMEONE<Jane> bashfully hides her face with her hand then grows serious. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS299
01:26:12,00 --> 01:26:18,50
He solemnly locks eyes with her and she beams, cocking her head. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS301
01:26:37,00 --> 01:26:43,50
Lights reveals the well-stocked artfully arranged on a central island. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS302
01:27:00,00 --> 01:27:05,50
He squints at the chalkboard menus. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS304
01:28:25,00 --> 01:28:29,50
back in the restaurant dining room. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS305
01:28:43,00 --> 01:28:48,50
SOMEONE<Jane> plucks a crumb from her croissant and eats it. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS306
01:29:02,00 --> 01:29:08,50
SOMEONE<Adam> skeptically quirks his brow. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS307
01:29:17,00 --> 01:29:22,50
She faces him and they lock gazes. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS308
01:29:26,00 --> 01:29:34,50
SOMEONE<Adam> strokes her hand then lifts it and examines her palm. He knits his brow. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS309
01:29:47,00 --> 01:29:52,50
He tenderly slides up her sleeve. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS310
01:29:56,00 --> 01:30:02,50
He kisses the inside of her wrist and wraps his hand around hers. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS311
01:30:05,00 --> 01:30:11,50
She nods and leans toward him. They share a steady kiss. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS312
01:30:13,00 --> 01:30:18,50
They start to kiss again. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS314
01:30:24,00 --> 01:30:30,50
She presses her forehead to his and shakes her head. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS317
01:30:36,00 --> 01:30:46,50
She strolls in with a bouquet of purple bellflowers then snips the ends off the stalks and puts them in a vase. SOMEONE<Luke> staggers out drowsily. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS318
01:31:03,00 --> 01:31:07,50
wears girl's pajamas. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS319
01:31:13,00 --> 01:31:17,50
SOMEONE<Gabby> arrives. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS320
01:31:18,00 --> 01:31:35,50
Frowning, SOMEONE<Jane> peeks out the window and finds SOMEONE's<Jake's> sports car parked in the driveway. SOMEONE's<Jake's> arm rests along the open window, SOMEONE<Jane> jogs outside, and he gets out. She casts a nervous glance back at the house then faces her ex-husband. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS321
01:32:00,00 --> 01:32:05,50
Their kids file outside. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS322
01:32:18,00 --> 01:32:24,50
SOMEONE<Jane> summons a breath, SOMEONE<Jake> glances at her. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS323
01:32:40,00 --> 01:32:45,50
SOMEONE<Jake> winces tearfully. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS324
01:32:45,00 --> 01:32:52,50
He turns away and covers his face with one hand. SOMEONE<Jane> squints at him doubtfully. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS325
01:32:51,00 --> 01:32:55,50
stifles tears and rubs her chest. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS326
01:33:02,00 --> 01:33:13,50
SOMEONE<Jake> eats breakfast with the rest of his family. Forking up a morsel of food he pours syrup right onto it then shovels it to his mouth, SOMEONE<Jane> gapes. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS327
01:33:14,00 --> 01:33:18,50
She forces a smile. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS328
01:33:17,00 --> 01:33:29,50
Later, wearing a wide-brimmed hat she stands in one of the plots of her spacious garden. She hunts around a five-foot plant then locates a tomato and sniffs it. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS329
01:33:27,00 --> 01:33:36,50
As she places it in her shallow vegetable basket SOMEONE<Jake> strolls into the garden. She nods irritably to herself. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS330
01:34:17,00 --> 01:34:22,50
widens his arms in a helpless gesture. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS331
01:34:31,00 --> 01:34:35,50
She hugs him and pats his back. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS332
01:34:38,00 --> 01:34:43,50
She fans herself with her hat. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS333
01:34:58,00 --> 01:35:02,50
She answers her cell. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS334
01:35:03,00 --> 01:35:07,50
She frowns and turns her back to him. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS335
01:35:13,00 --> 01:35:17,50
He smile and drops his gaze. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS336
01:35:18,00 --> 01:35:22,50
He heads off. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS337
01:35:27,00 --> 01:35:38,50
Later, SOMEONE<Jake> serves popcorn to his family as they snuggle under blankets in front of the television. He hands the bowl to SOMEONE<Jane> then one to SOMEONE<Lauren> and SOMEONE<Harley>. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS338
01:35:37,00 --> 01:35:42,50
He sits between SOMEONE<Gabby> and SOMEONE<Luke> with the third bowl and they smile at the TV. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS339
01:35:56,00 --> 01:36:02,50
SOMEONE<Jake> catches SOMEONE's<Jane's> eye and mouths, I'm so happy. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS340
01:36:04,00 --> 01:36:10,50
Nighttime, SOMEONE<Gabby> and SOMEONE<Luke> raid the fridge SOMEONE<Jake> joins them. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS341
01:36:16,00 --> 01:36:21,50
SOMEONE<Gabby> hands him a plastic tub. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS342
01:37:24,00 --> 01:37:28,50
SOMEONE<Jake> glares at SOMEONE<Harley>. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS343
01:37:31,00 --> 01:37:35,50
He sheepishly looks up from his bite. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS344
01:37:43,00 --> 01:37:47,50
He shows SOMEONE in a patterned sweater. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS345
01:37:56,00 --> 01:38:00,50
A dog pops out. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS346
01:38:07,00 --> 01:38:11,50
his shirt has three-quarter sleeves. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS347
01:38:35,00 --> 01:38:39,50
He runs out. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS348
01:38:37,00 --> 01:38:47,50
Now, SOMEONE<Jake> peeks into SOMEONE's<Jane's> bedroom. Her shadow passes over the curtains covering the window in the bathroom door.  

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS349
01:38:45,00 --> 01:38:50,50
went into the bedroom and gives a mischievous grin. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS350
01:38:48,00 --> 01:38:54,50
robe wearing only a t-shirt and boxers underneath. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS351
01:39:07,00 --> 01:39:14,50
then pulls the laptop closer. Now, SOMEONE<Adam> steps

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS352
01:39:38,00 --> 01:39:42,50
SOMEONE<Jake> bends for his boxer. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS353
01:39:44,00 --> 01:39:58,50
SOMEONE<Adam> falls out of his chair. SOMEONE<Jake> aims the laptop at SOMEONE<Jane>, then grabs his robe. SOMEONE<Adam> climbs back into his seat and locks eyes with SOMEONE<Jane> through the webcam. Her lips flutter helplessly. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS354
01:39:59,00 --> 01:40:03,50
SOMEONE<Luke> and SOMEONE<Lauren> run in. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS355
01:40:21,00 --> 01:40:26,50
The shocked siblings gape. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS356
01:40:26,00 --> 01:40:31,50
SOMEONE<Luke> looks to SOMEONE<Gabby>. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS357
01:40:50,00 --> 01:41:00,50
At his desk, SOMEONE<Adam> reaches for a button. His image vanishes from SOMEONE's<Jane's> screen. A tearful SOMEONE<Gabby> shifts her gaze. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS358
01:41:11,00 --> 01:41:17,50
SOMEONE<Gabby> and SOMEONE<Jake> each look to SOMEONE<Jane> who shakes her head. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS359
01:41:17,00 --> 01:41:21,50
SOMEONE<Jake> stares. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS360
01:41:22,00 --> 01:41:36,50
SOMEONE<Jane> leans heavily against an arched doorway. As SOMEONE's<Lauren's> chest heaves she nods and lowers her tearful gaze. SOMEONE<Luke> swallows, scratches the back of his head, then hurries out. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS361
01:41:34,00 --> 01:41:43,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> follows and SOMEONE<Gabby> trails after them. SOMEONE<Jake> and SOMEONE<Jane> gaze off in different directions avoiding eye contact. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS362
01:41:43,00 --> 01:41:56,50
Later, a duffle bag gets tossed on the backseat of a car. As her brother sits in the front passenger seat SOMEONE<Gabby> climbs behind the wheel. They swap shell-shocked looks and put on their seat belts. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS363
01:41:54,00 --> 01:42:25,50
In her SUV, SOMEONE<Lauren> gazes back at her mother's house as she and SOMEONE<Harley> drive away. SOMEONE's<Gabby's> car follows down the driveway. SOMEONE<Jane> jogs outside clutching a shawl around her shoulders and halts in the middle of the yard with a desperate shrug. The two vehicles speed off. Beyond her SOMEONE<Jake> trudges to his sport car with a leather travel bag. The grief-stricken man pauses and looks at his ex-wife. SOMEONE<Jane> eyes him resignedly. SOMEONE<Jake> gazes back at her then looks away and opens the driver side door. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS364
01:42:28,00 --> 01:42:41,50
Blinking back tears SOMEONE<Jane> sympathetically cocks her head. She watches as SOMEONE's<Jake's> sports car drives away passing a three-rail horse fence that lines the road. His car turns the corner. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS365
01:42:39,00 --> 01:42:50,50
The image dissolves to the surface of the pool. Beside it SOMEONE<Jane> lies on the lounge chair wrapped tightly in a blue shawl curled into a fetal position. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS366
01:42:48,00 --> 01:43:02,50
She stares up at the night sky with her hands crossed protectively over her chest. A three-quarter moon gleams high above the treetops. Clutching a rumpled tissue in her hands she closes her eyes and falls asleep. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS367
01:43:02,00 --> 01:43:12,50
Daytime, brilliant sunlight reflects off the surface of the pool and brightens SOMEONE's<Jane's> face as she sleeps on the lounge chair. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS368
01:43:15,00 --> 01:43:22,50
A butterfly flits over the pool, sprinklers come on nearby, and SOMEONE<Jane> wakes. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS369
01:43:22,00 --> 01:43:30,50
She looks up at the sunny sky then swings her legs down and glances around thoughtfully. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS370
01:43:29,00 --> 01:43:35,50
The lovelorn woman shakes her and bravely purses her lips. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS371
01:43:36,00 --> 01:43:43,50
At SOMEONE<Lauren> and SOMEONE's<Harley's> house SOMEONE's<Jane's> trots past the garage and up the winding steps to the front door above it. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS372
01:43:42,00 --> 01:43:46,50
SOMEONE<Harley> opens the door and smiles. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS373
01:43:49,00 --> 01:43:55,50
SOMEONE<Jane> steps inside and he shuts the door behind her. In a hallway, 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS374
01:44:02,00 --> 01:44:23,50
she opens a door and finds SOMEONE<Luke>, SOMEONE<Lauren>, and SOMEONE<Gabby> lying in bed together under a blanket. SOMEONE<Lauren> taps her brother and they sit up. From the hallway, SOMEONE<Harley> watches SOMEONE<Jane> tread into the room then peeks in after her. SOMEONE<Jane> sets her purse on a chair then takes a seat on the edge of the bed. The siblings hug their knees to their chests. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS375
01:45:52,00 --> 01:45:57,50
She drops her gaze and gives a pensive nod. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS376
01:46:05,00 --> 01:46:11,50
SOMEONE<Jane> nods and rests her hand on SOMEONE's<Luke's> knee. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS377
01:46:11,00 --> 01:46:22,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> covers her mother's hand with her own and SOMEONE<Luke> touches his sister's forearm. SOMEONE<Jane> shares a look with SOMEONE<Gabby> and draws them all into a hug. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS378
01:46:23,00 --> 01:46:27,50
He puts her arms around them. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS379
01:46:28,00 --> 01:46:38,50
Now at SOMEONE's<Adam's> architecture firm, SOMEONE<Jane> enters and crosses the bustling floor to SOMEONE's<Adam's> office. Large windows show him talking on a phone. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS380
01:46:44,00 --> 01:46:50,50
He glances over his shoulder and sees her waiting in the doorway. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS381
01:46:54,00 --> 01:46:58,50
He hangs up and musters a faint smile. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS382
01:47:01,00 --> 01:47:11,50
She slides the door close behind her then faces him clutching the strap of her purse with both hands. SOMEONE<Adam> rests his hands on his chair back. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS383
01:47:30,00 --> 01:47:34,50
They exchange nods. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS384
01:48:39,00 --> 01:48:45,50
SOMEONE<Jane> locks eyes with him and he regretfully tightens his lips. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS385
01:48:47,00 --> 01:48:52,50
She drops her eyes and shifts uncomfortably. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS386
01:49:02,00 --> 01:49:08,50
He paces away from her as she gives a fleeting smile. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS387
01:49:10,00 --> 01:49:16,50
He gives a gentle grin and she gazes at him earnestly. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS388
01:49:17,00 --> 01:49:23,50
Past the horse fence near her house, at the wheel she 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS389
01:49:36,00 --> 01:49:42,50
parked from across the front yard. She studies him through the window. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS390
01:49:42,00 --> 01:49:49,50
SOMEONE<Jane> climbs out of the SUV and shuts the door keeping her eyes fixed. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS392
01:49:55,00 --> 01:50:03,50
SOMEONE<Jane> treads closer, SOMEONE<Jake> scoots over inviting her to sit beside him. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS393
01:50:01,00 --> 01:50:07,50
SOMEONE crosses the walkway, sets down her purse, 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS394
01:50:07,00 --> 01:50:13,50
they share a lingering look and SOMEONE<Jake> glances away. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS395
01:50:13,00 --> 01:50:19,50
SOMEONE<Jane> shifts her stare then fixes it on him. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS396
01:50:38,00 --> 01:50:43,50
She moves to lean on one arm. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS397
01:51:57,00 --> 01:52:02,50
She smiles and shakes her head. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS398
01:52:04,00 --> 01:52:12,50
She bites her bottom lip and blinks at him sheepishly as the wind tousles her honey blonde hair. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS399
01:52:24,00 --> 01:52:28,50
She playfully points at him. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS400
01:52:29,00 --> 01:52:38,50
SOMEONE<Jane> gestures at him once again. SOMEONE<Jake> gives a broad shrug then drops his hands into his lap. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS401
01:52:36,00 --> 01:52:43,50
She reaches across the space between them and rubs his shoulder. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS402
01:52:43,00 --> 01:53:01,50
She looks away from him then leans one elbow on the armrest and gazes off thoughtfully. SOMEONE<Jake> watches her. Her fingertips drop from his shoulder and her arm rests on the back of the bench. As our view slowly orbits the ex-lovers SOMEONE's<Jake's> distanced stare drifts. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS403
01:53:01,00 --> 01:53:07,50
Now, a hard rain pounds down on the vacant bench swing. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS404
01:53:07,00 --> 01:53:12,50
the leafy plants in SOMEONE's garden and streams 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS405
01:53:11,00 --> 01:53:22,50
A view from the front door shows a flatbed truck carry timber past an excavator. SOMEONE<Jane> steps outside and opens an umbrella. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS406
01:53:20,00 --> 01:53:26,50
SOMEONE halts, gives a long nod. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS407
01:53:25,00 --> 01:53:31,50
She trudges toward a construction crew huddled around a table collapsible canopy. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS409
01:53:34,00 --> 01:53:39,50
The worker smiles. SOMEONE<Adam> steps up beside. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS410
01:53:38,00 --> 01:53:43,50
SOMEONE's<Jane's> eyes widened and her jaw drops open. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS411
01:54:00,00 --> 01:54:05,50
SOMEONE<Adam> smiles and she looks to the other men. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS412
01:54:08,00 --> 01:54:12,50
Workers gather their things and hurry. 

ITS_COMPLICATED_DVS413
01:54:11,00 --> 01:54:16,50
He nods at her beaming. SOMEONE<Jane> smiles and looks away.
