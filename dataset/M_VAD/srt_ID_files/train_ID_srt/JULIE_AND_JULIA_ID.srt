JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS26
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:48,50
The car halts in front of an ivy-covered building. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS27
00:02:51,00 --> 00:02:59,50
SOMEONE<Julia> steps out of the driver's seat and views the residence. A concierge opens double doors to a courtyard. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS28
00:03:04,00 --> 00:03:14,50
Now a woman packs an original copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking into a box with more cookbooks, then thrusts it into a packed jeep. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS29
00:03:12,00 --> 00:03:20,50
Queens, New York, 2002. She rides in the jeep next to a dark-haired man. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS30
00:03:24,00 --> 00:03:31,50
The young woman glances at her companion, and with a grin, shakes her head of short red hair. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS31
00:03:29,00 --> 00:03:40,50
The jeep drives past a tall decrepit warehouse and a water tower covered in graffiti. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS33
00:03:39,00 --> 00:03:59,50
The jeep pulls up to a small two-story brick building. A red and white checkered awning on the first floor's pizzeria shades the storefront. Music by Alexandre Desplat. The redhead trudges up the stairs to the vacant second floor apartment, toting a cat-carrier. She sets it down and opens its door. A ginger tabby steps out. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS35
00:04:01,00 --> 00:04:09,50
As the woman roams the empty apartment, the dark-haired man climbs the stairs with a box. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS36
00:04:12,00 --> 00:04:21,50
Later, the redhead unpacks items from boxes, while the dark-haired man goofs around in the half-settled bedroom. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS37
00:04:21,00 --> 00:04:26,50
He finds the redhead squatting in the kitchen. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS38
00:04:34,00 --> 00:04:38,50
The redhead gives a resigned nod. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS39
00:04:37,00 --> 00:04:42,50
She looks at her beau. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS40
00:04:48,00 --> 00:04:53,50
They sit side by side on the kitchen floor. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS41
00:04:58,00 --> 00:05:03,50
The redhead faces SOMEONE<Eric> somberly. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS42
00:05:03,00 --> 00:05:08,50
SOMEONE<Eric> presses his lips to her cheek. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS43
00:05:07,00 --> 00:05:14,50
Back in Paris, SOMEONE<Julia> roams their elegant apartment, fanning herself. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS44
00:05:15,00 --> 00:05:20,50
SOMEONE<Paul> enters, carrying a large wicker basket. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS45
00:05:23,00 --> 00:05:37,50
SOMEONE<Julia> opens French doors to a faux balcony, closing her eyes, as a breeze wafts through her curly hair. She smiles, takes in a savoring breath, then inspects the rest of the apartment. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS51
00:05:52,00 --> 00:05:57,50
SOMEONE<Julia> lies on the bed. Her feet hang off the end. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS52
00:05:58,00 --> 00:06:03,50
She glances at them, dangling over the mattress. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS53
00:06:01,00 --> 00:06:08,50
Now, in Queens, a burly man opens the storefront of the pizzeria. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS54
00:06:06,00 --> 00:06:15,50
The redhead with the short shaggy haircut exits from a door beside the pizza parlor. She smacks a plastic bag as it blows by. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS55
00:06:13,00 --> 00:06:23,50
Later, Manhattan skyscrapers rise into the sky beyond an old cursive Pepsi Cola sign. The former Brooklyn-er walks past it. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS59
00:06:29,00 --> 00:06:35,50
Later, she emerges from a subway station. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS60
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:40,50
As she passes ground zero, she glances at people gathered by a fence adorned with flowers and flags. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS61
00:06:38,00 --> 00:06:45,50
Now, she sits in a cluttered cubicle surrounded by other workers wearing headsets. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS62
00:06:58,00 --> 00:07:02,50
SOMEONE<Julie> closes her eyes. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS63
00:07:15,00 --> 00:07:20,50
SOMEONE<Julie> answers numerous calls. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS64
00:07:49,00 --> 00:07:56,50
Instructions on a cubicle wall read, "Do not become emotionally involved. " 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS65
00:07:53,00 --> 00:07:58,50
Now, SOMEONE<Julie> listens carefully. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS66
00:08:02,00 --> 00:08:07,50
Later, SOMEONE<Julie> talks to her boss. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS67
00:08:20,00 --> 00:08:25,50
SOMEONE<Julie> smiles gratefully and leaves. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS68
00:08:22,00 --> 00:08:30,50
Now, amid the flow of pedestrians on the sidewalk, she strides along with a down-hearted look. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS69
00:08:27,00 --> 00:08:33,50
She stops at a shop window displaying a chocolate fountain. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS70
00:08:35,00 --> 00:08:40,50
Later at the apartment, she stirs a bowl of chocolate filling. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS71
00:08:57,00 --> 00:09:01,50
SOMEONE<Eric> tastes the filling. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS72
00:09:09,00 --> 00:09:14,50
As SOMEONE<Eric> tastes more, SOMEONE<Julie> sips a cocktail. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS74
00:09:19,00 --> 00:09:28,50
SOMEONE<Julie> rushes into a SOMEONE<Tony> Bistro and greets a table of three smartly dressed women, one of whom talks on her cellphone. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS75
00:09:46,00 --> 00:09:50,50
The high-nose brunette hangs up. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS76
00:10:07,00 --> 00:10:11,50
The women gawk. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS77
00:10:15,00 --> 00:10:20,50
The snooty brunette answers her cellphone. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS78
00:10:36,00 --> 00:10:41,50
Cassie smiles knowingly. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS79
00:10:44,00 --> 00:10:49,50
The women clink their water glasses. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS80
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:19,50
As two of the women take calls, the redhaired friend faces SOMEONE<Julie>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS81
00:11:23,00 --> 00:11:27,50
Annabelle talks into a recorder. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS82
00:11:27,00 --> 00:11:36,50
As Annabelle talks into her handheld recorder, SOMEONE<Julie> nibbles a pencil-thin breadstick. Cassie takes it away. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS83
00:11:34,00 --> 00:11:40,50
SOMEONE<Julie> turns back to Annabelle, who checks her datebook. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS84
00:11:59,00 --> 00:12:07,50
Now, a poster shows SOMEONE, three others, and the title - Portrait of a Lost Generation. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS85
00:12:28,00 --> 00:12:33,50
Her mousy bohemian friend grimaces. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS86
00:12:35,00 --> 00:12:39,50
SOMEONE's<Julie's> friend looks away. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS87
00:12:40,00 --> 00:12:48,50
SOMEONE<Julie> gives an amused smirk. Later at home, she flips bread in a skillet, then slices tomatoes. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS88
00:13:01,00 --> 00:13:06,50
She points her knife at SOMEONE<Eric>, who reads on the couch. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS89
00:13:36,00 --> 00:13:41,50
SOMEONE<Julie> raises her brow and smiles. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS90
00:13:39,00 --> 00:13:44,50
They eat Parmesan-sprinkled bruschetta. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS91
00:14:05,00 --> 00:14:10,50
SOMEONE<Julie> gives SOMEONE<Eric> a forlorn look. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS92
00:14:13,00 --> 00:14:18,50
They sip red wine. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS93
00:14:15,00 --> 00:14:21,50
SOMEONE<Julie> shifts her eyes thoughtfully as she forks up a piece of sausage. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS94
00:14:32,00 --> 00:14:37,50
SOMEONE<Eric> grins, his mouth full of food. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS95
00:15:00,00 --> 00:15:07,50
SOMEONE<Eric> gazes at SOMEONE's<Julie's> delighted face. Now they watch SOMEONE<Julia> on TV. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS96
00:15:19,00 --> 00:15:24,50
SOMEONE<Julia> Child holds a pan. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS97
00:15:30,00 --> 00:15:35,50
Her flip misses. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS98
00:15:42,00 --> 00:15:47,50
SOMEONE<Julia> returns fallen bits to the pan. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS99
00:16:05,00 --> 00:16:10,50
SOMEONE<Julie> grins, and SOMEONE<Eric> kisses her on the cheek. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS100
00:16:13,00 --> 00:16:22,50
As credits cycle on the black-and-white show, SOMEONE<Eric> and SOMEONE<Julie> smooch. SOMEONE<Julie> reclines on the couch, and SOMEONE<Eric> lovingly climbs on top of her. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS101
00:16:23,00 --> 00:16:28,50
Later, SOMEONE<Julie> sits in bed reading SOMEONE's<Julia's> cookbook. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS102
00:16:29,00 --> 00:16:34,50
She flips the page, and sets the book down. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS103
00:16:31,00 --> 00:16:36,50
SOMEONE<Eric> shakes a tums into his hand. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS104
00:16:39,00 --> 00:16:43,50
He climbs into bed. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS105
00:17:40,00 --> 00:17:45,50
Morning. SOMEONE<Julie> and SOMEONE<Eric> face a laptop. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS106
00:17:43,00 --> 00:17:49,50
Her blog is titled - The SOMEONE<Julie>, SOMEONE<Julia> Project. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS107
00:17:55,00 --> 00:18:00,50
A new window appears. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS108
00:17:58,00 --> 00:18:02,50
Later, SOMEONE<Julie> types. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS109
00:18:41,00 --> 00:18:51,50
In a countdown field, SOMEONE<Julie> enters 365 days to go, and 524 recipes to go. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS110
00:18:48,00 --> 00:18:53,50
In Paris, SOMEONE<Julia> visits an outdoor market. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS111
00:18:56,00 --> 00:19:08,50
Baguettes jut from her shopping basket. As SOMEONE<Julia> passes two butchers, one holds up a hare, still with its fur. The aspiring cook grimaces, then meets a green grocer. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS112
00:19:12,00 --> 00:19:16,50
Now she buys nuts. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS113
00:19:19,00 --> 00:19:24,50
SOMEONE<Paul> snaps her photo. Now with an oyster man. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS114
00:19:28,00 --> 00:19:33,50
Now the Child stroll through a park. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS116
00:19:41,00 --> 00:19:47,50
They pass a baby carriage, and SOMEONE's<Julia's> smile fades. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS117
00:19:49,00 --> 00:19:53,50
Now at a photography exhibit. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS118
00:20:02,00 --> 00:20:06,50
Now at a restaurant. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS119
00:20:10,00 --> 00:20:14,50
A waiter brings food. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS120
00:20:20,00 --> 00:20:27,50
As SOMEONE<Julia> puts out a cigarette, SOMEONE<Paul> steals a bite from her plate. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS121
00:20:30,00 --> 00:20:35,50
SOMEONE<Julie> refrains from digging in and faces SOMEONE<Paul>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS122
00:20:50,00 --> 00:20:54,50
She shifts her restless gaze. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS123
00:21:05,00 --> 00:21:12,50
SOMEONE<Paul> stares wide-eyed at her. He shifts his gaze then nods. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS124
00:21:17,00 --> 00:21:22,50
Her husband eyes her with an affectionate smirk. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS125
00:21:37,00 --> 00:21:50,50
Now in a millinery workshop, SOMEONE<Julia> sits before an unadorned hat on a stand. Her expression listless. She picks up a ribbon and pulls one end through the other with a dissatisfied pout. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS126
00:21:48,00 --> 00:21:52,50
Later on a park bench. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS127
00:22:01,00 --> 00:22:06,50
In a bridge class, SOMEONE<Julia> stares out a window. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS128
00:22:09,00 --> 00:22:13,50
Now at a bookstore. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS129
00:22:17,00 --> 00:22:21,50
Now with a tutor. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS130
00:23:13,00 --> 00:23:22,50
Now at a restaurant, SOMEONE<Julia> sits at the head of a long crowded table. SOMEONE<Paul> presents her with a gift. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS131
00:23:24,00 --> 00:23:29,50
She unwraps it, revealing a thick book. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS132
00:23:27,00 --> 00:23:32,50
She turns it, showing the title. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS133
00:23:29,00 --> 00:23:34,50
Larousse Gastronomique. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS134
00:23:39,00 --> 00:23:43,50
SOMEONE<Julia> kisses SOMEONE<Paul>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS135
00:23:41,00 --> 00:23:46,50
A waiter brings a pastry with a candle. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS136
00:23:44,00 --> 00:23:51,50
She blows out the flame. Later in bed, she leafs through the book. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS137
00:23:48,00 --> 00:23:53,50
Photos show poultry being prepared. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS138
00:24:29,00 --> 00:24:34,50
Setting the book aside, SOMEONE<Paul> kisses her. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS139
00:24:38,00 --> 00:24:45,50
SOMEONE<Paul> nibbles her neck, then pulls her in for another passionate kiss. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS140
00:24:42,00 --> 00:24:49,50
SOMEONE<Julia> strokes his stomach, then eyes him adoringly as he removes his glasses. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS141
00:24:52,00 --> 00:24:58,50
Their embrace grows more intense, and they lie back together. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS142
00:24:55,00 --> 00:25:00,50
SOMEONE<Paul> switches off his bedside lamp. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS143
00:25:00,00 --> 00:25:04,50
SOMEONE switches off her lamp, 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS144
00:25:01,00 --> 00:25:06,50
and SOMEONE<Paul> tenderly rolls on top of her. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS145
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:11,50
Now an alarm clock reads 5:30. SOMEONE<Julie> rises then types at her laptop. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS146
00:25:15,00 --> 00:25:20,50
Now she chops off an artichoke stem. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS147
00:25:24,00 --> 00:25:29,50
She whips the sauce. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS148
00:25:40,00 --> 00:25:44,50
She and SOMEONE<Eric> eat. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS149
00:25:48,00 --> 00:25:53,50
Five pounds of it sit in her fridge. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS150
00:25:51,00 --> 00:25:55,50
She melts a chunk in her pan. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS151
00:25:56,00 --> 00:26:01,50
She adds two more. Now she sautés mushrooms. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS152
00:26:25,00 --> 00:26:29,50
Her words type out. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS153
00:26:29,00 --> 00:26:33,50
Now she buys cheese. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS154
00:26:50,00 --> 00:26:55,50
She descends subway stairs. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS155
00:27:11,00 --> 00:27:15,50
SOMEONE<Julie> cooks while on the phone. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS156
00:28:10,00 --> 00:28:16,50
She returns to the kitchen. Now she types. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS157
00:28:25,00 --> 00:28:29,50
SOMEONE<Sarah> stares. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS158
00:28:28,00 --> 00:28:32,50
A pot steams. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS159
00:28:34,00 --> 00:28:38,50
She cracks an egg into the water. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS160
00:28:43,00 --> 00:28:50,50
With a wooden spoon, SOMEONE<Julie> prods the egg. It disintegrates into filmy stands. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS161
00:29:08,00 --> 00:29:12,50
SOMEONE<Julie> tries a bite. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS162
00:29:24,00 --> 00:29:28,50
She raises her glass. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS163
00:29:40,00 --> 00:29:44,50
She eats another bite of egg. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS164
00:30:03,00 --> 00:30:07,50
SOMEONE<Sarah> points upward. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS166
00:30:23,00 --> 00:30:27,50
SOMEONE<Julie> blogs at work. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS167
00:30:34,00 --> 00:30:38,50
A comment window appears. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS168
00:30:38,00 --> 00:30:47,50
Her co-worker grins. The comment reads, "Julie, it's your mother. I still don't understand why you're doing this. I seem to be your only reader. " 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS169
00:30:48,00 --> 00:30:54,50
At Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, SOMEONE<Julia> and two other women face a teacher. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS170
00:31:02,00 --> 00:31:06,50
Now in an office. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS171
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:33,50
Madame SOMEONE<Brassart> shakes her head. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS172
00:31:51,00 --> 00:32:02,50
Now a classroom door opens. Wandering in, SOMEONE<Julia> beams excitedly. A chef with a snowy mustache looks up, and his male students turn. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS173
00:32:03,00 --> 00:32:16,50
Later, we move down a long table, watching masculine hands rapidly chop onions. SOMEONE's<Julia's> hands tentatively saw with her knife into an onion. Her classmates stare, and the chef approaches. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS174
00:32:14,00 --> 00:32:19,50
SOMEONE<Julia> notices the others watching. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS175
00:32:40,00 --> 00:32:53,50
Later at home, SOMEONE<Julia> practices chopping. A mound of chopped onions two feet across sits on the wooden tabletop. SOMEONE<Paul> appears in the doorway, recoils and rubs his eyes. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS176
00:33:07,00 --> 00:33:13,50
With an amused smile, SOMEONE<Paul> shakes his head and leaves. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS177
00:33:18,00 --> 00:33:22,50
She resumes practicing. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS178
00:33:20,00 --> 00:33:25,50
Now in class, she finishes chopping first. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS179
00:33:24,00 --> 00:33:37,50
Later, she and her classmates each melt butter in a pan. SOMEONE<Julia> adds beaten eggs and shakes her pan back and forth over a gas flame. Her fellow students add their eggs too. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS180
00:33:35,00 --> 00:33:44,50
Madame SOMEONE<Brassart> enters, folds her arms and watches SOMEONE<Julia> with a sour glare. Straightening, the aspiring chef lifts her pan. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS181
00:33:44,00 --> 00:33:49,50
She gives it a small upward jerk, and flips the omelet. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS182
00:33:49,00 --> 00:33:55,50
Madame SOMEONE<Brassart> leaves with an indignant huff. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS183
00:34:42,00 --> 00:34:46,50
She bisects a lobster's head. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS184
00:34:49,00 --> 00:34:54,50
SOMEONE<Paul> pulls her unto his lap, and kisses her. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS185
00:34:51,00 --> 00:34:56,50
He takes her into the bedroom. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS186
00:34:56,00 --> 00:35:01,50
As they embrace, she yanks down his suspenders. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS187
00:35:03,00 --> 00:35:07,50
In class, the master chef paces. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS188
00:35:22,00 --> 00:35:26,50
Now at a fish mongers. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS189
00:35:37,00 --> 00:35:42,50
She browses pastries then tastes a pair. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS190
00:35:51,00 --> 00:35:55,50
At home, she types. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS191
00:36:01,00 --> 00:36:07,50
SOMEONE<Paul> brings a mortar and pestle. Now at a dinner party. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS192
00:36:18,00 --> 00:36:23,50
Everyone wears a paper heart badge. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS193
00:36:42,00 --> 00:36:46,50
SOMEONE<Paul> sits at the head of the table. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS194
00:37:24,00 --> 00:37:29,50
SOMEONE's<Julia's> merry smile fades. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS195
00:37:29,00 --> 00:37:36,50
SOMEONE<Paul> holds her in a loving gaze. Her chest heaves, and she beams radiantly. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS196
00:37:39,00 --> 00:37:45,50
SOMEONE<Julia> slips a hand beneath her paper heart. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS197
00:37:42,00 --> 00:37:46,50
She flutters it. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS198
00:37:46,00 --> 00:37:52,50
Now SOMEONE<Paul> watches her cooking. She towers over their French kitchen. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS199
00:37:57,00 --> 00:38:01,50
She whacks hanging pots. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS200
00:38:23,00 --> 00:38:27,50
Now in Queens. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS201
00:38:43,00 --> 00:38:47,50
They open mail. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS202
00:38:48,00 --> 00:38:55,50
SOMEONE<Julie> opens a padded envelope, which contains a small bottle and a note. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS203
00:38:59,00 --> 00:39:04,50
Now SOMEONE<Julie> receives more food items. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS204
00:39:08,00 --> 00:39:11,50
She types. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS205
00:39:13,00 --> 00:39:17,50
SOMEONE<Julie> blows her nose. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS206
00:39:18,00 --> 00:39:22,50
She takes out a soufflé. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS207
00:39:44,00 --> 00:39:48,50
At a fish market, 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS208
00:39:49,00 --> 00:39:58,50
an employee takes a live lobster from a tank and bags it, SOMEONE<Julie> and SOMEONE<Eric> swap a look. Now in the jeep. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS209
00:40:02,00 --> 00:40:10,50
Behind them, the plastic bag ruffles as a lobster crawls around. SOMEONE<Eric> glances at SOMEONE<Julie>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS210
00:40:08,00 --> 00:40:15,50
SOMEONE<Julie> unbuckles her seat-belt, and checks the bag. The lobster looks at her. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS211
00:40:16,00 --> 00:40:21,50
She sits down. Now at home. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS212
00:40:40,00 --> 00:40:45,50
She snaps tongs at him. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS213
00:40:51,00 --> 00:40:59,50
She dons a rubber glove, removes the lid from a pot of boiling water, and takes a lobster out of the bag. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS214
00:40:58,00 --> 00:41:03,50
She faces the pot. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS215
00:41:01,00 --> 00:41:06,50
She stuffs the lobster in, then grabs another. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS216
00:41:04,00 --> 00:41:11,50
She stuffs a second lobster in the pot, and returns to the bag for a third. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS217
00:41:10,00 --> 00:41:19,50
She sticks the third in the pot, flips a stray antenna off the brim, and puts the lid back on. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS218
00:41:16,00 --> 00:41:23,50
Standing over the closed pot with all the lobsters inside, SOMEONE<Julie> smiles proudly. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS219
00:41:25,00 --> 00:41:38,50
The lid pops into the air, and SOMEONE<Julie> runs out of the kitchen. SOMEONE<Eric> hops up as SOMEONE<Julie> flails her arms and clutches her head. SOMEONE<Eric> grabs the hot lid from the floor, and covers the pot. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS220
00:41:43,00 --> 00:41:48,50
SOMEONE<Julie> lets go of her head and looks over. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS221
00:41:50,00 --> 00:41:57,50
As she cautiously approaches the kitchen, SOMEONE<Eric> grabs an apple and takes a bite. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS222
00:42:03,00 --> 00:42:07,50
She kisses him. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS223
00:42:05,00 --> 00:42:10,50
He kisses her hungrily. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS224
00:42:21,00 --> 00:42:25,50
She shoves him out of the kitchen. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS225
00:42:23,00 --> 00:42:27,50
SOMEONE<Julie> jumps. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS226
00:42:24,00 --> 00:42:32,50
Later, SOMEONE<Eric> greets arriving guests. One guy hands off a cake. He and SOMEONE<Eric> hug. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS227
00:42:31,00 --> 00:42:38,50
Dressed like SOMEONE<Julia> Child, SOMEONE<Julie> puts her hands on her hips and faces her guests. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS228
00:42:39,00 --> 00:42:45,50
SOMEONE<Julie> models her '50s era look, then hugs her friends. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS229
00:42:46,00 --> 00:42:50,50
Later, over dinner. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS230
00:43:09,00 --> 00:43:13,50
SOMEONE<Julie> holds up her fork. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS231
00:43:47,00 --> 00:43:51,50
Later, SOMEONE<Julie> blows out candles. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS232
00:43:52,00 --> 00:43:58,50
They serve the birthday cake. Now SOMEONE<Eric> hands SOMEONE<Julie> a gift. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS233
00:43:58,00 --> 00:44:04,50
SOMEONE<Julie> takes the present and looks SOMEONE<Eric> in the eyes. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS234
00:44:02,00 --> 00:44:08,50
She tears off the wrapping paper to find a thin box. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS235
00:44:08,00 --> 00:44:13,50
Opening it, SOMEONE grins at SOMEONE, 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS236
00:44:10,00 --> 00:44:15,50
then reveals a pearl necklace. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS237
00:44:27,00 --> 00:44:33,50
SOMEONE<Eric> sets down his cup of coffee, and goes behind her. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS238
00:44:33,00 --> 00:44:41,50
As he wraps the necklace around her neck, SOMEONE<Julie> snaps off the fake plasticky pearls she's wearing. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS239
00:44:40,00 --> 00:44:46,50
She feels her new pearls and smiles. SOMEONE<Eric> sits by her. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS240
00:44:55,00 --> 00:45:01,50
Misty-eyed, SOMEONE<Julie> grins then waves her hands. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS241
00:45:03,00 --> 00:45:09,50
Later, still in her SOMEONE<Julia> getup, SOMEONE<Julie> sleeps on the couch. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS242
00:45:07,00 --> 00:45:11,50
SOMEONE<Eric> enters and leans over her. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS243
00:45:15,00 --> 00:45:21,50
He turns off a lamp and leaves her sleeping peacefully. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS244
00:45:18,00 --> 00:45:25,50
Now at work, SOMEONE<Julie> glances over her cubicle to a co-worker. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS245
00:45:26,00 --> 00:45:31,50
They playfully slap hands, then sit back down. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS246
00:45:52,00 --> 00:45:56,50
Later with SOMEONE<Eric>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS247
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:03,50
In bed. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS248
00:46:21,00 --> 00:46:26,50
As SOMEONE falls asleep, 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS249
00:46:23,00 --> 00:46:33,50
SOMEONE<Eric> grabs a bedside container of antacid tablets and pops one in his mouth. He shuts off a lamp, and stares up at the ceiling. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS250
00:46:32,00 --> 00:46:37,50
Now at a ballroom party. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS251
00:46:35,00 --> 00:46:40,50
Two French women head for the ladies room. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS252
00:46:39,00 --> 00:46:45,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Julia> sits at a vanity, smoking a cigarette. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS253
00:46:43,00 --> 00:46:48,50
Another American woman stands at a mirror. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS254
00:46:54,00 --> 00:46:58,50
The third woman primps. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS255
00:47:30,00 --> 00:47:34,50
Another woman enters. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS256
00:48:11,00 --> 00:48:15,50
SOMEONE<Julia> stands. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS257
00:48:15,00 --> 00:48:22,50
SOMEONE<Simca> and SOMEONE<Louisette> eye her stature. Now all three exit the ladies room. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS258
00:49:11,00 --> 00:49:16,50
SOMEONE<Brassart> leaves SOMEONE<Julia> alone at a desk. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS259
00:49:17,00 --> 00:49:23,50
Now SOMEONE<Julia> shops with SOMEONE<Simca> and SOMEONE<Louisette>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS260
00:49:48,00 --> 00:49:54,50
A surprised SOMEONE<Julia> regards her new friends. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS261
00:50:00,00 --> 00:50:04,50
At Le Cordon Bleu. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS262
00:50:19,00 --> 00:50:25,50
SOMEONE<Brassart> steps out, leaving SOMEONE<Julia> to retake her test. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS263
00:50:26,00 --> 00:50:33,50
Now in Queens, a hardback of SOMEONE<Julia> Child's biography strikes the alarm clock. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS264
00:51:08,00 --> 00:51:13,50
SOMEONE<Julia> drops the aspic in the sink. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS265
00:51:11,00 --> 00:51:15,50
SOMEONE<Eric> peeks in. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS266
00:51:34,00 --> 00:51:38,50
She faces the sink. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS267
00:51:39,00 --> 00:51:44,50
SOMEONE<Eric> glances over as food and liquid spit up from the drain. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS268
00:52:02,00 --> 00:52:09,50
SOMEONE<Julie> pursues him to the couch. SOMEONE<Eric> shields his head with a pillow. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS269
00:52:24,00 --> 00:52:29,50
SOMEONE<Julie> returns to the kitchen and kicks a trash can. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS270
00:52:27,00 --> 00:52:31,50
At her laptop. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS272
00:52:50,00 --> 00:52:54,50
She stuffs it back in. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS273
00:52:58,00 --> 00:53:03,50
She sits on the floor, SOMEONE<Eric> notices. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS274
00:53:12,00 --> 00:53:17,50
She hunches forward. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS275
00:53:31,00 --> 00:53:38,50
On the kitchen floor, SOMEONE<Julie> lies flat on her back. SOMEONE<Eric> approaches. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS276
00:53:44,00 --> 00:53:48,50
SOMEONE<Julie> sits up. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS277
00:53:53,00 --> 00:53:58,50
She gets up, goes into the living room, and grabs a tissue. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS278
00:54:10,00 --> 00:54:16,50
SOMEONE<Eric> mouths, "Who?" And SOMEONE<Julie> waves him off with a tissue. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS279
00:54:24,00 --> 00:54:29,50
Now SOMEONE<Louisette> holds up a glass of wine. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS280
00:54:32,00 --> 00:54:38,50
SOMEONE<Julia> and SOMEONE<Simca> stand across from her in the Child's kitchen. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS281
00:55:07,00 --> 00:55:12,50
SOMEONE<Julia> and SOMEONE<Simca> lift a table. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS282
00:55:10,00 --> 00:55:14,50
SOMEONE<Louisette> stands. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS283
00:55:24,00 --> 00:55:28,50
They teach. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS284
00:55:57,00 --> 00:56:02,50
SOMEONE<Louisette> steps out. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS285
00:56:06,00 --> 00:56:12,50
SOMEONE<Julia> tweaks knobs of dough baked together. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS286
00:56:15,00 --> 00:56:19,50
In a train station. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS287
00:56:25,00 --> 00:56:29,50
SOMEONE<Paul> listens intently. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS288
00:56:35,00 --> 00:56:42,50
On a platform, SOMEONE<Julia> waits next to SOMEONE<Paul>, holding yellow flowers. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS289
00:56:46,00 --> 00:56:54,50
A tall curly-haired woman with big hips gawks, smiling as she charges. The sisters embrace. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS290
00:56:57,00 --> 00:57:01,50
SOMEONE<Paul> takes SOMEONE's<Dorothy's> handbag. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS291
00:57:11,00 --> 00:57:15,50
In a restaurant. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS292
00:57:15,00 --> 00:57:20,50
A waiter serves cheese. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS293
00:57:56,00 --> 00:58:01,50
SOMEONE<Dorothy> faces SOMEONE<Paul>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS294
00:58:13,00 --> 00:58:22,50
The sisters hook pinkies, tap their thumbs together, then wiggle their hands away. SOMEONE<Julia> playfully taps SOMEONE<Dorothy> on the nose. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS295
00:58:23,00 --> 00:58:27,50
SOMEONE<Dorothy> tries a dollop. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS296
00:58:31,00 --> 00:58:36,50
SOMEONE<Julia> sucks a bit of cheese off her thumb. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS298
00:59:14,00 --> 00:59:19,50
SOMEONE<Julia> gives a proud smile, and shrugs. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS299
00:59:53,00 --> 01:00:03,50
Now SOMEONE<Dorothy> faces a wardrobe's full-length mirror. SOMEONE<Julia> enter, putting in an earring, and fastens a string of pearls around SOMEONE's<Dorothy's> neck. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS300
01:00:00,00 --> 01:00:06,50
Both wear a collared knee-length dress of shiny fabric. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS301
01:00:03,00 --> 01:00:09,50
SOMEONE's<Dorothy's> is coppery orange, and SOMEONE's<Julia's> is midnight blue. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS302
01:00:08,00 --> 01:00:15,50
They smile and cock their heads. SOMEONE<Julia> slips her hands into her pockets. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS303
01:00:16,00 --> 01:00:21,50
SOMEONE<Dorothy> offers a merry shrug. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS305
01:00:19,00 --> 01:00:29,50
Outside, upstairs windows show a crowded cocktail party within. Inside, SOMEONE<Julia> mingles with a tray of hors d'oeuvres. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS306
01:00:31,00 --> 01:00:35,50
Two guest sample the fair. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS307
01:00:37,00 --> 01:00:42,50
A tall man faces SOMEONE<Julia>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS308
01:00:40,00 --> 01:00:44,50
She kisses his cheek. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS309
01:00:48,00 --> 01:00:53,50
SOMEONE<Dorothy> flirts with a shorter man. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS310
01:01:01,00 --> 01:01:12,50
As SOMEONE<Dorothy> leans alluringly on an archway before an enchanted SOMEONE<Ivan>, SOMEONE<Julia> frowns. SOMEONE<Ivan> coyly brushes SOMEONE's<Dorothy's> belt with his finger. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS311
01:01:09,00 --> 01:01:15,50
SOMEONE<Julia> winces, and SOMEONE<Paul> eyes the pair curiously. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS312
01:01:15,00 --> 01:01:27,50
Now at an outdoor wedding, a young flower girl scatters handfuls of petals. She overshoots the aisle, then backtracks and heads down it toward a waiting priest. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS313
01:01:26,00 --> 01:01:31,50
SOMEONE<Julia> files down the grassy aisle in her heels. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS314
01:01:28,00 --> 01:01:35,50
SOMEONE<Dorothy> follows, wearing a simple wedding dress, and holding her father's arm. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS315
01:01:34,00 --> 01:01:40,50
She kisses his cheek, then faces the priest with SOMEONE<Ivan>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS316
01:01:41,00 --> 01:02:00,50
Later, an elegant pavilion with a roof shaped like a pith helmet houses dining tables and a dance floor. SOMEONE<Dorothy> and SOMEONE<Ivan> prance toward each other and clasps hands. SOMEONE<Ivan> blows SOMEONE<Dorothy> a kiss, then lifts her arm and pivots beneath it. They wave at SOMEONE<Julia>, who sits with SOMEONE<Paul> and her parents. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS317
01:02:02,00 --> 01:02:06,50
Her father lights her cigarette. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS318
01:02:15,00 --> 01:02:20,50
He glares at SOMEONE<Paul>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS319
01:02:31,00 --> 01:02:36,50
SOMEONE<Julia> kicks SOMEONE<Paul>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS320
01:03:01,00 --> 01:03:06,50
SOMEONE<Paul> and SOMEONE<Julia> hurry to the dance floor. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS321
01:03:08,00 --> 01:03:14,50
Joining the other slow dancers, they clasp hands. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS322
01:03:11,00 --> 01:03:18,50
SOMEONE<Paul> wraps his arm around SOMEONE's<Julia's> waist, and they share a soft smile. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS323
01:03:15,00 --> 01:03:22,50
Nearby, SOMEONE<Dorothy> bends and nuzzles SOMEONE<Ivan>, then kisses his forehead. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS324
01:03:20,00 --> 01:03:28,50
SOMEONE<Julia> lovingly cups SOMEONE's<Paul's> face in both hands, and he playfully dodges away. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS325
01:03:25,00 --> 01:03:31,50
Later, he kisses her neck as they dance toward the newlyweds. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS326
01:03:29,00 --> 01:03:36,50
SOMEONE<Julia> and SOMEONE<Dorothy> squeeze each other's arms, and SOMEONE<Paul> and SOMEONE<Ivan> shake hands. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS327
01:03:34,00 --> 01:03:41,50
Now, the Childs' wood paneled station wagon drives over a bridge. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS328
01:03:38,00 --> 01:03:45,50
Later, outside their villa, SOMEONE<Paul> picks up mail from their concierge. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS329
01:03:45,00 --> 01:03:51,50
Now in the kitchen, SOMEONE<Julia> whisks a creamy sauce. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS330
01:04:01,00 --> 01:04:06,50
SOMEONE<Paul> scoops some up with his pinkie and samples it. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS331
01:04:17,00 --> 01:04:22,50
SOMEONE<Julia> opens a letter. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS332
01:04:20,00 --> 01:04:24,50
She reads. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS333
01:04:22,00 --> 01:04:27,50
As SOMEONE<Paul> snacks obliviously, she takes a seat. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS334
01:04:26,00 --> 01:04:32,50
He glances at her. She flips to a second page. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS335
01:04:45,00 --> 01:04:49,50
She buries her face in his shoulder. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS336
01:04:47,00 --> 01:04:52,50
He squeezes her close. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS337
01:04:51,00 --> 01:04:56,50
He tenderly kisses her forehead. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS338
01:04:55,00 --> 01:04:59,50
She pats his chest. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS339
01:05:00,00 --> 01:05:05,50
He presses his lips to her forehead once again. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS340
01:05:04,00 --> 01:05:08,50
In a cafe. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS343
01:05:20,00 --> 01:05:25,50
SOMEONE<Julia> pulls out documents. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS345
01:05:25,00 --> 01:05:33,50
She hands the sheets to Simone and SOMEONE<Louisette>, then studies their expressions. Her smile fades. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS346
01:06:20,00 --> 01:06:25,50
SOMEONE<Julia> beams and closes her eyes. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS347
01:06:26,00 --> 01:06:31,50
Now in Queens, SOMEONE<Julie> types. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS348
01:07:07,00 --> 01:07:11,50
In a market. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS350
01:07:15,00 --> 01:07:19,50
SOMEONE<Julie> cooks. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS351
01:07:43,00 --> 01:07:47,50
She puts it in the oven. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS352
01:07:46,00 --> 01:07:50,50
She sets a timer. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS353
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:55,50
Later, a TV reads - the French chef. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS354
01:07:53,00 --> 01:07:59,50
Dressed like SOMEONE<Julia> Child, Dan Aykroyd faces the camera. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS355
01:08:40,00 --> 01:08:44,50
The actor waivers. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS356
01:08:47,00 --> 01:08:52,50
Fake blood spews, dousing the chicken. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS357
01:08:56,00 --> 01:09:01,50
Fake blood pours from his hand. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS358
01:09:01,00 --> 01:09:05,50
It spurts toward the camera. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS359
01:09:13,00 --> 01:09:20,50
SOMEONE<Julie> and SOMEONE<Eric> quake with laughter. Blood covers the actor's white blouse. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS360
01:09:24,00 --> 01:09:28,50
He passes out. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS361
01:09:25,00 --> 01:09:36,50
Later, SOMEONE's<Julie's> timer ticks down from 57 minutes to 56. As SOMEONE<Eric> sleeps in bed, a clock on the nightstand reads 1:30. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS362
01:09:33,00 --> 01:09:41,50
In the living room, SOMEONE<Julie> snoozes on the couch. Later, the timer shows one minute remaining. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS363
01:09:44,00 --> 01:09:49,50
It ticks down to zero. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS364
01:09:46,00 --> 01:09:51,50
SOMEONE<Julie> shifts in her sleep, snuggling a blanket. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS365
01:09:49,00 --> 01:09:54,50
Outside, the pizzeria's lights go dark. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS366
01:09:51,00 --> 01:09:59,50
In the living room, SOMEONE<Julie> still sleeps. The tabby jumps off the couch and ambles away. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS367
01:09:57,00 --> 01:10:04,50
It strolls into the kitchen and takes a seat, staring at the oven. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS368
01:10:01,00 --> 01:10:05,50
Later, in the living room. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS369
01:10:06,00 --> 01:10:11,50
SOMEONE<Julie> jolts awake, and gives a horrified gape. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS370
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:15,50
She scrambles into the kitchen. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS371
01:10:14,00 --> 01:10:21,50
She yanks out the pot and takes off the lid, revealing her ruined stew. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS372
01:10:18,00 --> 01:10:26,50
Back in Paris, SOMEONE<Julia> sits at a typewriter and lays carbon paper between two clean white pages. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS373
01:10:34,00 --> 01:10:39,50
She rolls the paper into the device. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS374
01:10:48,00 --> 01:10:52,50
SOMEONE<Julia> blinks. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS375
01:10:56,00 --> 01:11:01,50
She drags on a cigarette. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS376
01:11:15,00 --> 01:11:20,50
Seated at his own desk, SOMEONE<Paul> shifts. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS377
01:11:28,00 --> 01:11:33,50
Standing reluctantly, SOMEONE<Paul> paces toward her. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS378
01:11:31,00 --> 01:11:36,50
He briefly creases his lips. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS379
01:11:49,00 --> 01:11:53,50
He narrows his eyes. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS380
01:11:52,00 --> 01:11:57,50
Later in a restaurant. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS381
01:12:56,00 --> 01:13:00,50
SOMEONE<Paul> raises his glass. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS382
01:13:08,00 --> 01:13:13,50
Now SOMEONE<Julia> types. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS383
01:13:35,00 --> 01:13:39,50
In a subway station. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS384
01:13:47,00 --> 01:13:51,50
A train arrives. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS385
01:14:00,00 --> 01:14:03,50
The women board. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS386
01:14:01,00 --> 01:14:06,50
Now a maid leads them into a sitting room. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS388
01:14:46,00 --> 01:14:50,50
Irma shooting herself. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS390
01:15:47,00 --> 01:15:52,50
SOMEONE<Paul> hands his wife a letter. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS391
01:15:52,00 --> 01:16:04,50
SOMEONE<Julia> slips the letter from the envelope as she follows SOMEONE<Paul> into the apartment. She sits at the small entryway table, where SOMEONE<Paul> turns on a lamp, and sets down his hat. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS392
01:16:01,00 --> 01:16:05,50
SOMEONE<Julia> smiles. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS393
01:16:10,00 --> 01:16:14,50
She glares at the ceiling. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS394
01:16:27,00 --> 01:16:32,50
SOMEONE<Julia> steps frantically about. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS395
01:16:55,00 --> 01:16:59,50
SOMEONE<Julia> reads more. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS396
01:17:00,00 --> 01:17:07,50
Now in Queens, SOMEONE<Julie> writes in her blog, as SOMEONE<Eric> pulls on his jacket. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS397
01:17:15,00 --> 01:17:19,50
SOMEONE<Eric> grabs his bike. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS398
01:17:23,00 --> 01:17:27,50
At the meat market. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS399
01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:43,50
SOMEONE<Julie> breathes in the stew's steam. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS400
01:17:44,00 --> 01:17:49,50
She stirs thick pink cream. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS401
01:18:02,00 --> 01:18:06,50
She sets out crudités. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS402
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:17,50
SOMEONE<Julie> stows a stack of newspapers in a bin. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS403
01:18:15,00 --> 01:18:20,50
She briskly strides to the phone and picks up. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS404
01:18:24,00 --> 01:18:29,50
She smiles broadly and nods. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS405
01:18:32,00 --> 01:18:36,50
Her face falls. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS406
01:18:37,00 --> 01:18:41,50
She sits on the couch. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS407
01:18:44,00 --> 01:18:50,50
SOMEONE<Eric> watches as SOMEONE<Julie> poutily hangs up. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS408
01:18:49,00 --> 01:18:54,50
SOMEONE<Julie> shakes her head, her lips pursed in a frown. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS409
01:19:11,00 --> 01:19:15,50
SOMEONE<Eric> struts away. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS410
01:19:43,00 --> 01:19:47,50
SOMEONE<Eric> salts his food. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS411
01:19:51,00 --> 01:19:55,50
SOMEONE<Julie> watches, her mouth agape. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS412
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:32,50
SOMEONE<Julie> bites a carrot stick. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS413
01:20:55,00 --> 01:21:00,50
SOMEONE<Julie> glares from the bathroom doorway. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS414
01:21:06,00 --> 01:21:10,50
SOMEONE<Eric> grabs his jacket. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS415
01:21:11,00 --> 01:21:16,50
He puts it on as he strides toward the stairs. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS416
01:21:14,00 --> 01:21:21,50
He grabs his coat from a hook, picks up his bag, and hurries downstairs. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS417
01:21:21,00 --> 01:21:29,50
Back in Paris, SOMEONE<Paul> carefully wraps a pot lid in newspaper and packs it into a box. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS418
01:21:26,00 --> 01:21:35,50
Facing him, SOMEONE<Julia> fidgets with her cardigan as she gazes forlornly around the half-packed kitchen. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS419
01:21:32,00 --> 01:21:36,50
SOMEONE<Paul> looks at her. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS420
01:21:37,00 --> 01:21:41,50
SOMEONE<Julia> forces a smile. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS421
01:22:10,00 --> 01:22:14,50
The Childs’ pose for a photo. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS422
01:22:13,00 --> 01:22:17,50
They hold a paper heart. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS423
01:22:16,00 --> 01:22:24,50
SOMEONE<Julia> addresses a postcard version of the Valentine. Now they pose in a tub. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS424
01:22:27,00 --> 01:22:38,50
In a postcard version, they share a doting gaze amid the soapy suds. SOMEONE<Julia> ink stamps the postcard, “Wish you were here,” and addresses it. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS425
01:22:58,00 --> 01:23:04,50
Now SOMEONE<Paul> snaps photos of SOMEONE<Julia> stuffing a duck. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS426
01:23:08,00 --> 01:23:13,50
SOMEONE<Julia> sews the duck, binding it around the stuffing. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS427
01:23:20,00 --> 01:23:24,50
SOMEONE<Paul> gives a reserved nod. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS428
01:23:31,00 --> 01:23:37,50
SOMEONE<Julia> poses, pulling the sewn flaps of the duck together. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS429
01:23:40,00 --> 01:23:44,50
In Paris. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS430
01:24:13,00 --> 01:24:18,50
Now at a cafe with SOMEONE<Louisette>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS431
01:24:49,00 --> 01:24:56,50
SOMEONE's<Louisette's> eyes filled with tears, and she blows her nose on a folded handkerchief. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS432
01:25:17,00 --> 01:25:22,50
SOMEONE<Louisette> glares. SOMEONE<Simca> faces her. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS433
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:59,50
SOMEONE<Julia> resumes eating. Later she returns with SOMEONE<Simca> to her apartment. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS434
01:26:02,00 --> 01:26:08,50
SOMEONE's<Simca's> concierge opens the front door as they approach. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS435
01:26:07,00 --> 01:26:12,50
SOMEONE<Julia> uses the phone. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS436
01:26:48,00 --> 01:26:52,50
With SOMEONE<Paul>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS437
01:26:51,00 --> 01:26:55,50
SOMEONE<Paul> smiles faintly. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS438
01:26:54,00 --> 01:26:58,50
An investigator leans closer. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS439
01:27:08,00 --> 01:27:12,50
SOMEONE<Paul> sits on the edge of the bed. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS440
01:27:23,00 --> 01:27:28,50
He climbs in next to SOMEONE<Julia>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS441
01:27:29,00 --> 01:27:36,50
As he settles under the covers, SOMEONE<Julia> watches with tender thoughtful eyes. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS442
01:27:36,00 --> 01:27:41,50
SOMEONE<Paul> turns questioningly to his wife. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS443
01:27:39,00 --> 01:27:45,50
He shifts his down-hearted gaze, and SOMEONE<Julia> looks away. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS444
01:27:50,00 --> 01:27:55,50
She gets comfy under the covers. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS445
01:27:54,00 --> 01:27:58,50
They share a glance. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS446
01:28:03,00 --> 01:28:10,50
They look at each other, and SOMEONE<Julia> worriedly presses her lips together. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS447
01:28:07,00 --> 01:28:13,50
SOMEONE<Paul> touches her forehead reassuringly, then turns off the light. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS449
01:28:13,00 --> 01:28:19,50
In Queens, SOMEONE<Julie> shifts restlessly in bed. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS450
01:28:16,00 --> 01:28:21,50
With a frown, she glances at SOMEONE's<Eric's> empty pillow. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS451
01:28:19,00 --> 01:28:24,50
Later she sits at her laptop. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS452
01:28:41,00 --> 01:28:47,50
SOMEONE's<Julie's> wide blue eyes filled with tears as she types. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS453
01:28:44,00 --> 01:28:50,50
She rests her chin on her hand and re-reads the passage. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS454
01:28:48,00 --> 01:28:52,50
Her lips tighten sorrowfully. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS455
01:28:49,00 --> 01:28:57,50
She highlights the last sentence, deletes it, and determinedly resumes typing. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS456
01:29:03,00 --> 01:29:11,50
Now, as SOMEONE<Julie> carries a paper bag to work, the bottom breaks, and the dessert crashes to the ground. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS457
01:29:08,00 --> 01:29:12,50
At the office. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS458
01:29:11,00 --> 01:29:15,50
SOMEONE<Julie> greets Ernestine. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS459
01:29:18,00 --> 01:29:25,50
As SOMEONE<Julie> appears in the doorway, her boss turns from his computer and gives her a stern look. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS460
01:29:26,00 --> 01:29:30,50
SOMEONE<Julie> nods and sits down. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS461
01:29:43,00 --> 01:29:47,50
SOMEONE<Julie> nods. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS462
01:29:52,00 --> 01:29:57,50
She nods again, her face solemn. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS463
01:29:55,00 --> 01:30:00,50
She purses her lips and rises. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS464
01:30:03,00 --> 01:30:09,50
Hands in her skirt pockets, SOMEONE<Julie> heads off. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS465
01:30:06,00 --> 01:30:12,50
Later she sits at a bar with SOMEONE<Sarah>, holding a half-drunk Martini. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS466
01:30:17,00 --> 01:30:21,50
SOMEONE<Julie> shakes her head. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS467
01:30:25,00 --> 01:30:30,50
SOMEONE<Sarah> gives a sympathetic look. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS468
01:30:29,00 --> 01:30:33,50
SOMEONE<Sarah> sips her Martini. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS469
01:30:40,00 --> 01:30:45,50
SOMEONE<Sarah> knits her brow. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS470
01:30:45,00 --> 01:30:50,50
SOMEONE<Julie> gives a thoughtful look. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS471
01:30:48,00 --> 01:30:54,50
Later SOMEONE<Julie> rides the train home, then writes in her blog. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS472
01:31:43,00 --> 01:31:51,50
She moves the cursor to the publish button on screen and clicks it, then turns off the desk lamp. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS473
01:31:54,00 --> 01:32:02,50
SOMEONE<Julie> picks up the cordless phone and dials. She sits on the bed with the handset to her ear. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS474
01:31:59,00 --> 01:32:05,50
Meanwhile in his office, SOMEONE<Eric> lies on the couch reading. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS475
01:32:02,00 --> 01:32:07,50
He glances at the phone. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS476
01:32:20,00 --> 01:32:24,50
In the apartment, SOMEONE<Julie> hangs up. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS477
01:32:22,00 --> 01:32:28,50
In his office, SOMEONE<Eric> leans his head back on a pillow. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS478
01:32:25,00 --> 01:32:31,50
SOMEONE<Julie> falls backward onto the bed, the phone clutched to her chest. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS479
01:32:29,00 --> 01:32:33,50
She turns it on again and listens. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS480
01:32:35,00 --> 01:32:38,50
She hangs up. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS481
01:32:36,00 --> 01:32:45,50
Now, SOMEONE<Eric> sits at his work computer, eyes trained on SOMEONE's<Julie's> blog. As he reads her latest entry, he swallows hard. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS482
01:32:43,00 --> 01:32:52,50
In the apartment, SOMEONE<Julie> lays face-down on the bed with a pillow over her head, and the phone clutched in her hand. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS483
01:33:34,00 --> 01:33:39,50
SOMEONE<Julie> hangs up and glares at the phone. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS484
01:33:36,00 --> 01:33:41,50
With a resolute look, she sits up. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS485
01:33:39,00 --> 01:33:43,50
She flops back again. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS486
01:33:41,00 --> 01:33:49,50
She sits up, swings her legs off the bed, and marches into the kitchen. The phone still in her hand. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS487
01:33:53,00 --> 01:34:07,50
Later, SOMEONE<Julie> strides out of the apartment. Her face set firmly. Inside a market, she closes her eyes as she smells a bunch of fresh basil. Now she walks down the sidewalk toting a grocery bag. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS488
01:34:10,00 --> 01:34:18,50
She slows down as she approaches the apartment, and notices SOMEONE<Eric> crossing the street toward her. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS489
01:34:15,00 --> 01:34:21,50
He puts his hands in his pockets, and greets her with a faint smile. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS490
01:34:22,00 --> 01:34:28,50
She flashes a hopeful wide-eyed smile. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS491
01:34:28,00 --> 01:34:33,50
She tears up. SOMEONE<Eric> takes a deep breath. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS492
01:34:32,00 --> 01:34:37,50
He smiles warmly, and SOMEONE<Julie> reciprocates. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS493
01:34:34,00 --> 01:34:41,50
SOMEONE's<Eric's> lips spread in a wide grin, and he reaches for SOMEONE's<Julie's> groceries. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS494
01:34:38,00 --> 01:34:45,50
He takes the bag, then slings an arm around her shoulders as they head inside. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS495
01:34:46,00 --> 01:34:52,50
Now, SOMEONE<Julia> and SOMEONE<Simca> cross a train station. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS496
01:35:11,00 --> 01:35:17,50
They set down their luggage and sit on a bench. SOMEONE<Julia> shows her a letter. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS497
01:36:10,00 --> 01:36:19,50
They peer across the terminal to an entrance, where a bespectacled woman in a plaid jacket hurries in and stops. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS498
01:36:16,00 --> 01:36:24,50
She spots their bench, and SOMEONE<Julia> stands. The newcomer touches her chest. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS499
01:36:23,00 --> 01:36:29,50
With open arms, the two cross the floor and embrace. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS500
01:36:31,00 --> 01:36:34,50
They hug. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS501
01:36:32,00 --> 01:36:40,50
Now in a conference room, the three of them sit with three male executives and a female editor. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS502
01:37:49,00 --> 01:37:56,50
A book entitled, Real Home-cooking, shows a chubby American woman. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS503
01:38:00,00 --> 01:38:07,50
Now at her home, Avis mixes cocktails. SOMEONE<Simca> reads the cookbook. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS504
01:38:44,00 --> 01:38:49,50
Avis regards SOMEONE<Julia>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS505
01:39:20,00 --> 01:39:25,50
Now, SOMEONE<Julia> sharpens a knife. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS506
01:39:23,00 --> 01:39:43,50
In her own kitchen, SOMEONE<Julie> sharpens a knife and slices the air. Now we see SOMEONE<Julia> turning a crank on a manual sieve strainer, then SOMEONE<Julie> turning on a food processor. SOMEONE<Julia> punches keys on a typewriter, floating island. SOMEONE's laptop screen shows her write, "So last night I made floating. " 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS507
01:39:41,00 --> 01:39:55,50
SOMEONE<Julia> taste gooey cheese topping. SOMEONE<Julie> pinches cheese stretching to her lips. SOMEONE<Julia> rubs creamy paste on an uncooked chicken. SOMEONE<Julie> removes a cooked chicken from the oven. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS508
01:39:56,00 --> 01:40:08,50
Now SOMEONE<Julia>, then SOMEONE<Julie>, then SOMEONE<Paul>, then SOMEONE<Eric>, each raid the medicine chests in their bathrooms. As SOMEONE<Julia> spreads icing over a cake,

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS509
01:40:05,00 --> 01:40:10,50
SOMEONE<Paul> enters and dabs his finger in the bowl. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS510
01:40:08,00 --> 01:40:20,50
She smacks his hand, as he steals a taste. SOMEONE<Julie> lays out a chocolate frosted cake, rimmed with chipped almonds. Before she can slice it, SOMEONE<Eric> digs in. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS511
01:40:18,00 --> 01:40:29,50
He playfully smushes a piece into her mouth, then rubs it over his own face. Now SOMEONE<Julia> and SOMEONE<Paul> box up a copy of the manuscript. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS512
01:40:50,00 --> 01:40:57,50
Now SOMEONE<Julie> sprays a mirror with glass cleaner and wipes it down. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS513
01:41:12,00 --> 01:41:17,50
SOMEONE<Julie> goes to the intercom. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS514
01:41:20,00 --> 01:41:27,50
Later, a photographer documents the pork chops and side dishes. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS515
01:41:32,00 --> 01:41:37,50
As they eat, the reporter jots notes. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS516
01:42:12,00 --> 01:42:17,50
The chewing reporter's eyes widen. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS517
01:42:19,00 --> 01:42:28,50
Now a man reads a newspaper article entitled, A Race to Master the Art of French Cooking, with SOMEONE's<Julie's> picture. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS518
01:42:26,00 --> 01:42:31,50
SOMEONE<Julie> sits next to the reader on the subway. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS519
01:42:29,00 --> 01:42:39,50
At a food shop, SOMEONE<Julie> peeks over a man's shoulder, who glances at the same article. She turns to Ernestine and they high five. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS520
01:42:40,00 --> 01:42:47,50
At work, SOMEONE<Julie> sets down a cup of coffee and puts on her headset. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS521
01:43:04,00 --> 01:43:10,50
At home, SOMEONE<Julie> carries a stack of newspapers upstairs. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS522
01:43:09,00 --> 01:43:13,50
SOMEONE<Eric> lies on the couch. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS523
01:43:19,00 --> 01:43:26,50
She puts the stack of papers down. Puts down her purse and goes to the machine. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS524
01:43:32,00 --> 01:43:38,50
SOMEONE<Julie> bounces excitedly and beams at her husband. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS525
01:43:53,00 --> 01:43:58,50
She dives on top of him, and kisses him repeatedly. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS526
01:44:12,00 --> 01:44:19,50
Now a shirtless SOMEONE<Eric> carries SOMEONE<Julie> over to the bed, and they flop onto it. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS527
01:44:45,00 --> 01:44:49,50
Their cat looks up. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS528
01:44:47,00 --> 01:44:52,50
In bed, SOMEONE<Eric> rolls on his back. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS529
01:44:51,00 --> 01:44:58,50
SOMEONE<Julie> carries in two full martini glasses and sits with him on the bed. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS530
01:45:25,00 --> 01:45:29,50
SOMEONE<Julie> rushes to the phone. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS531
01:45:28,00 --> 01:45:35,50
SOMEONE<Eric> looks on from the bed. Listening, SOMEONE's<Julie's> expression goes blank. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS532
01:45:55,00 --> 01:46:01,50
SOMEONE<Julie> hangs up and looks at SOMEONE<Eric> sitting up attentively. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS533
01:46:00,00 --> 01:46:04,50
She frowns. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS534
01:46:02,00 --> 01:46:07,50
Back in the 50s, SOMEONE sits on a couch with her feet up. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS535
01:46:04,00 --> 01:46:08,50
SOMEONE<Paul> arrives. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS536
01:46:16,00 --> 01:46:21,50
SOMEONE<Paul> sets down his briefcase, and SOMEONE<Julia> hands him a letter. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS537
01:46:20,00 --> 01:46:26,50
He shifts her feet a smidge on the coffee table and sits facing her. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS538
01:46:25,00 --> 01:46:30,50
He adjusts his glasses and reads. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS539
01:47:00,00 --> 01:47:05,50
SOMEONE<Paul> folds up the letter and lays it aside. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS540
01:47:14,00 --> 01:47:20,50
SOMEONE<Paul> takes a seat beside her on the couch, and rests a hand on her thigh. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS541
01:47:31,00 --> 01:47:35,50
She eyes him. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS542
01:48:15,00 --> 01:48:19,50
She takes his hand. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS543
01:48:18,00 --> 01:48:22,50
He kisses her hand. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS544
01:48:21,00 --> 01:48:26,50
He wraps his arm around her and kisses her forehead. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS545
01:48:27,00 --> 01:48:34,50
Now, a sign outside an office reads, Alfred A. Knopf, New York. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS546
01:48:43,00 --> 01:48:48,50
A preppy editor reads the title page. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS547
01:48:50,00 --> 01:49:02,50
SOMEONE<Judith> exhales wearily through pursed lips, then picks up the box containing the manuscript and leans back in her chair. As she reads, a smile spreads across her face. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS548
01:49:01,00 --> 01:49:08,50
Later, at home, SOMEONE<Judith> dries cubed red meat with a paper towel. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS549
01:49:06,00 --> 01:49:14,50
Now she pours red wine into a stock pot on the stove. Steam surges upward. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS550
01:49:12,00 --> 01:49:18,50
A recipe at her side reads - Boeuf Bourguignon. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS551
01:49:15,00 --> 01:49:22,50
Later, the editor faces the pot, skeptically tensing her lips. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS552
01:49:19,00 --> 01:49:26,50
She slurps a sample from a wooden spoon, smacks her lips, and smiles. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS553
01:49:28,00 --> 01:49:32,50
She scoops up a chunk and eats it. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS554
01:49:30,00 --> 01:49:35,50
Her eyelids flutter as she reels ecstatically. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS555
01:49:36,00 --> 01:49:40,50
She shakes her head. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS556
01:49:38,00 --> 01:49:48,50
Now, words label a two-story colonial house - Cambridge, Massachusetts. In a kitchen, SOMEONE<Paul> and SOMEONE<Julia> organize and unpack cookware. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS557
01:49:54,00 --> 01:50:01,50
Outside, a postman waits at the front door. SOMEONE<Julia> opens up and shivers. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS558
01:50:03,00 --> 01:50:07,50
SOMEONE<Julia> signs on a clipboard. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS559
01:50:07,00 --> 01:50:16,50
She shoves her arms into the sleeves of a sweater draped over her shoulders. The postman hands her an envelope and leaves. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS560
01:50:14,00 --> 01:50:18,50
The envelope reads - 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS561
01:50:15,00 --> 01:50:21,50
Alfred A. Knopf, incorporated, special delivery. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS562
01:50:20,00 --> 01:50:27,50
SOMEONE<Julia> clutches the letter to her chest and glances nervously inside the house. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS563
01:50:24,00 --> 01:50:35,50
Creeping across the porch, the chef summons a breath and paces. She takes a seat on a cushion wicker bench, opens the envelope, and reads. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS564
01:51:21,00 --> 01:51:25,50
They hug. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS565
01:51:34,00 --> 01:51:39,50
In her office, SOMEONE<Judith> posts note cards. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS566
01:51:43,00 --> 01:51:49,50
SOMEONE<Judith> rearranges some of the cards on the bulletin board and reads the result. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS567
01:51:50,00 --> 01:51:54,50
SOMEONE<Julia> perks up. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS568
01:51:52,00 --> 01:51:56,50
SOMEONE<Judith> gapes. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS569
01:52:05,00 --> 01:52:10,50
Now in SOMEONE's<Julie's> Queens apartment. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS573
01:52:41,00 --> 01:52:46,50
They sit face to face. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS574
01:52:59,00 --> 01:53:04,50
SOMEONE<Julie> slouches, wincing tearfully. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS575
01:53:03,00 --> 01:53:07,50
She flops onto the bed. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS576
01:53:07,00 --> 01:53:11,50
She sits back up. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS577
01:53:24,00 --> 01:53:28,50
Now SOMEONE<Julie> types. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS578
01:53:50,00 --> 01:53:56,50
She turns to a duck recipe now on TV. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS579
01:54:13,00 --> 01:54:17,50
SOMEONE<Julie> aims her knife. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS580
01:54:25,00 --> 01:54:31,50
SOMEONE<Julie> slides the blade down the back of a raw duck on a cutting board. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS581
01:54:35,00 --> 01:54:43,50
Later on TV, SOMEONE<Julia> sews the stuffed duck shut. SOMEONE<Julie> does the same. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS582
01:54:40,00 --> 01:54:45,50
On TV, SOMEONE<Julia> wraps the duck in pastry dough. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS583
01:54:42,00 --> 01:54:50,50
SOMEONE<Julie> swaddles her's in dough too. Later she pulls a golden dough wrapped loaf from the even. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS584
01:54:53,00 --> 01:55:00,50
On a roof, SOMEONE<Eric> passes SOMEONE<Julie> flowers and plates through a window. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS585
01:54:59,00 --> 01:55:04,50
SOMEONE<Eric> climbs out and jogs around to help her. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS586
01:55:03,00 --> 01:55:08,50
Nighttime at a rooftop dinner party. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS587
01:55:07,00 --> 01:55:12,50
SOMEONE<Julie> brings out the duck and bows. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS588
01:55:18,00 --> 01:55:23,50
SOMEONE<Eric> raises his glass. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS589
01:55:20,00 --> 01:55:25,50
The guests toast. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS590
01:55:24,00 --> 01:55:28,50
Later they dine. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS591
01:55:31,00 --> 01:55:35,50
SOMEONE<Julie> takes a bite. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS592
01:55:34,00 --> 01:55:41,50
She taps her glass, stands, and swallows facing her husband. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS593
01:55:51,00 --> 01:55:55,50
SOMEONE<Eric> raises his glass. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS594
01:55:55,00 --> 01:55:59,50
She blogs. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS595
01:56:17,00 --> 01:56:22,50
Our view drifts away from SOMEONE's<Julie's> window. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS596
01:56:19,00 --> 01:56:27,50
Now in a Smithsonian, a wall display reads - SOMEONE<Julia> Child's Kitchen. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS597
01:56:25,00 --> 01:56:32,50
SOMEONE<Julie> and SOMEONE<Eric> arrive at a roped off exhibit as a wistful young woman snaps a photo of it. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS598
01:56:34,00 --> 01:56:40,50
SOMEONE<Eric> takes a photo of the counters. SOMEONE<Julie> points. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS599
01:56:42,00 --> 01:56:46,50
SOMEONE<Eric> snaps another photo. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS600
01:56:45,00 --> 01:56:51,50
SOMEONE<Julie> poses, smiling by a portrait of SOMEONE<Julia>. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS601
01:56:48,00 --> 01:56:52,50
SOMEONE<Eric> takes a picture. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS602
01:56:55,00 --> 01:57:00,50
SOMEONE<Julie> poses as if chatting. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS603
01:56:59,00 --> 01:57:03,50
She leans close. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS604
01:57:08,00 --> 01:57:12,50
SOMEONE<Eric> heads off. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS605
01:57:09,00 --> 01:57:16,50
SOMEONE<Julie> faces SOMEONE's<Julia's> portrait with a faint smile, then glances around wearily. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS606
01:57:14,00 --> 01:57:20,50
Opening her purse, she pulls out a pound of butter, and shows to the portrait. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS607
01:57:18,00 --> 01:57:21,50
and shows to the portrait. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS608
01:57:19,00 --> 01:57:28,50
She sets it down on a ledge beneath the framed photograph, and gazes at the renowned chef's coy grin. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS609
01:57:27,00 --> 01:57:32,50
SOMEONE<Julie> smiles and strolls off around a corner. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS610
01:57:33,00 --> 01:57:41,50
Beside the portrait, SOMEONE's<Julia's> Cambridge kitchen stands by, quaint and vacant. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS611
01:57:38,00 --> 01:57:47,50
Celery green paint covers the door and a set of drawers, and seafoam blue covers the cupboards. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS612
01:57:44,00 --> 01:57:52,50
In the center of the homey well-organized space, the table rests, set for two. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS613
01:57:49,00 --> 01:57:58,50
We glide inside, over the rope cordoning off the room, and past cookbooks crammed unto a narrow bookshelf. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS614
01:57:55,00 --> 01:58:01,50
Cookware hangs from pegboard on the walls. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS615
01:57:58,00 --> 01:58:09,50
The overhead lighting fades and shadows appear, as sunshine washes in from one side. A shadow passes over the door. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS616
01:58:06,00 --> 01:58:10,50
Then SOMEONE<Julia> bustles in. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS617
01:58:08,00 --> 01:58:17,50
She lifts the lid of a Dutch oven on the stove, and steam billows out. Bending over, she sniffs the contents. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS618
01:58:17,00 --> 01:58:22,50
She picks up a wooden spoon and stirs the stew. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS619
01:58:20,00 --> 01:58:25,50
As SOMEONE<Paul> enters, SOMEONE<Julia> glances up. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS620
01:58:25,00 --> 01:58:29,50
They share a kiss. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS621
01:58:31,00 --> 01:58:37,50
SOMEONE<Paul> plops a package down on the table and takes a seat. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS622
01:58:34,00 --> 01:58:39,50
SOMEONE<Julia> adjusts the stove, and joins him. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS623
01:58:39,00 --> 01:58:45,50
He hands her the package, the chef takes it quizzically. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS624
01:58:42,00 --> 01:58:49,50
Turning it over, she slides her fingers under the manila envelope’s flap, 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS625
01:58:46,00 --> 01:58:50,50
then struggles to rip it open. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS626
01:58:51,00 --> 01:58:57,50
She pulls out a hardcover copy of her book. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS627
01:58:54,00 --> 01:58:59,50
Her jaw drops. 

JULIE_AND_JULIA_DVS628
01:59:05,00 --> 01:59:11,50
She claps a hand to her mouth, and the image freezes.
