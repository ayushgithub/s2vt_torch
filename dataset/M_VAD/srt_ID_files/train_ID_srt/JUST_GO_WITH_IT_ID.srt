JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS13
00:02:51,00 --> 00:02:58,50
The frowning beauty arrives beside SOMEONE<Danny> and accidentally drops her purse. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS14
00:03:04,00 --> 00:03:09,50
As he sets it on the bar, she spies his wedding ring. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS15
00:04:11,00 --> 00:04:15,50
The pair leaves. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS17
00:04:29,00 --> 00:04:34,50
She puts his hand on her breast. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS18
00:04:38,00 --> 00:04:44,50
He keeps his hand on her chest. Beverly Hills 2011. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS19
00:04:57,00 --> 00:05:03,50
He leaves a note on a young woman's pillow, Cindy I had a great night. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS20
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:06,50
P. S, thanks for not beating me like my wife does. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS21
00:05:03,00 --> 00:05:11,50
Now at a medical practice, a woman takes a stiff dark liquid filled sack from a box. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS22
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:15,50
A deliveryman eyes the product. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS23
00:05:30,00 --> 00:05:35,50
She grabs her own breast. The man reaches for it. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS24
00:05:49,00 --> 00:05:55,50
With a woman who has one eyebrow much higher than the other. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS25
00:06:03,00 --> 00:06:08,50
SOMEONE’s<Kristen’s> botched eyebrow rises even higher. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS26
00:06:14,00 --> 00:06:19,50
SOMEONE<Kristen> dryly lowers her chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS27
00:06:30,00 --> 00:06:35,50
Her eyebrow remains cocked. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS28
00:06:33,00 --> 00:06:37,50
She nods. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS29
00:06:44,00 --> 00:06:49,50
Her brow shoots to her hairline. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS30
00:07:08,00 --> 00:07:13,50
As he hugs her, she waggles her brows. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS31
00:07:14,00 --> 00:07:18,50
SOMEONE's<Danny's> cousin arrives. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS32
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:23,50
SOMEONE<Eddie> eyes SOMEONE<Kristen>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS33
00:08:25,00 --> 00:08:32,50
Now stylish guests attend a hip party at a mansion overlooking the ocean. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS34
00:08:29,00 --> 00:08:36,50
SOMEONE<Danny> and SOMEONE<Eddie> approach a man with an unnaturally stiff, smooth face. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS35
00:09:23,00 --> 00:09:28,50
As they down drinks, wine spills down his chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS36
00:09:36,00 --> 00:09:40,50
Now in a bathroom. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS37
00:09:40,00 --> 00:09:44,50
SOMEONE<Danny> pockets his ring. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS38
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:05,50
He gives Ariel a shot, then smacks him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS39
00:10:18,00 --> 00:10:22,50
Later, they leave the bathroom. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS40
00:10:22,00 --> 00:10:31,50
Clad in a filmy cerulean dress, a young statuesque beauty with sun-kissed skin and long blonde hair approaches SOMEONE<Danny>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS41
00:10:28,00 --> 00:10:35,50
The longtime bachelor stops in his tracks and stares. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS42
00:11:04,00 --> 00:11:12,50
As the pair steps outside, Adon struggles to close his lips around his straw. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS43
00:11:23,00 --> 00:11:28,50
A taut-faced woman. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS44
00:11:47,00 --> 00:11:51,50
Later on the beach. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS45
00:12:54,00 --> 00:13:03,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> leans in and kisses him. Their arms twine around each other and they sway on their feet. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS47
00:13:01,00 --> 00:13:09,50
In a nock encased by tall rock formations, SOMEONE<Palmer> and SOMEONE<Danny> lie between two blankets. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS48
00:13:41,00 --> 00:13:49,50
Digging through his pockets, SOMEONE<Palmer> finds the wedding ring. Her smile vanishes as she holds it up. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS49
00:14:15,00 --> 00:14:19,50
She chucks the ring at him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS50
00:14:17,00 --> 00:14:23,50
She marches down the beach. Now at SOMEONE's<Danny's> medical practice. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS51
00:14:33,00 --> 00:14:39,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> tosses her hair and smiles vapidly. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS52
00:15:16,00 --> 00:15:20,50
Two kids enter with a stout SOMEONE<nanny>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS53
00:15:51,00 --> 00:15:56,50
The SOMEONE<nanny> plays a hand-held video game. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS54
00:18:46,00 --> 00:18:51,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> faces him with a wide-eyed smirk. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS55
00:18:51,00 --> 00:19:02,50
Now at a private school, SOMEONE<Palmer> leads a student through a crowded hallway. SOMEONE<Danny> enters with flowers. Seeing him, the young teacher turns away. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS56
00:19:06,00 --> 00:19:12,50
She dumps the extravagant bouquet in a trash bin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS57
00:19:26,00 --> 00:19:31,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> takes him to a classroom. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS59
00:21:23,00 --> 00:21:30,50
SOMEONE<Danny> faces a window. From the other side, Silas glares and points menacingly. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS60
00:21:29,00 --> 00:21:34,50
On Rodeo Drive. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS61
00:22:21,00 --> 00:22:28,50
Now in a high-end store, she wobbles in a pair of four-inch heels. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS62
00:23:39,00 --> 00:23:44,50
SOMEONE<Danny> gives her a gentle shove, and she falls over. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS63
00:23:41,00 --> 00:23:48,50
Now SOMEONE<Katherine> eyes a vast display of designer handbags. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS64
00:23:45,00 --> 00:23:51,50
Later, SOMEONE<Danny> carries a few shopping bags in each hand, as he follows her. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS65
00:23:49,00 --> 00:23:56,50
In a store, SOMEONE<Katherine> tries on one stylish curve-hugging dress after another. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS66
00:23:53,00 --> 00:23:59,50
SOMEONE<Danny> gives her a playful shove, and she swats at him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS67
00:23:56,00 --> 00:24:01,50
She shakes her hips, and they laugh. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS68
00:23:58,00 --> 00:24:08,50
Later, SOMEONE<Danny> follows her out of Tiffany's, loaded down with shopping bags. Now a hairdresser eyes SOMEONE<Katherine> appraisingly. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS69
00:24:09,00 --> 00:24:14,50
She frowns as he coldly approaches. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS70
00:24:12,00 --> 00:24:19,50
Bending down, he takes up handfuls of her long honey-brown hair and peers closely at it. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS71
00:25:08,00 --> 00:25:14,50
Now at an upscale sunlit lounge. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS72
00:25:27,00 --> 00:25:37,50
From a stairway, SOMEONE<Katherine> ascends into view in a white sheet dress that shows off her long tan legs and graceful curves. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS73
00:25:34,00 --> 00:25:44,50
Her hair tousled in sexy waves, she smirks through glamorous sunglasses. A distinguished man in a suit trails her dutifully. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS74
00:25:41,00 --> 00:25:48,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> turns and her jaw drops at the site of the other woman. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS75
00:25:50,00 --> 00:25:56,50
Moving in slow motion, SOMEONE<Katherine> blows a kiss to a stranger. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS76
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:51,50
She slaps the waiter's rear. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS77
00:26:56,00 --> 00:27:01,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> nearly chokes on her red wine. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS78
00:28:51,00 --> 00:28:55,50
SOMEONE<Danny> jolts. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS79
00:29:02,00 --> 00:29:07,50
She kicks SOMEONE<Danny> hard in the shin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS80
00:29:16,00 --> 00:29:20,50
Later, they leave. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS81
00:30:14,00 --> 00:30:20,50
Facing SOMEONE<Danny>, she finds him staring pointedly at her. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS82
00:30:39,00 --> 00:30:44,50
She abruptly gets in the limo. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS83
00:30:45,00 --> 00:30:51,50
SOMEONE<Danny> turns to SOMEONE<Palmer>, who stares agog at him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS84
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:32,50
At Pizza Hut. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS85
00:31:44,00 --> 00:31:49,50
The SOMEONE<nanny> salsa dances around a janitor. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS86
00:32:49,00 --> 00:32:54,50
They shake hands on it. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS87
00:32:55,00 --> 00:33:00,50
SOMEONE<Danny> faces her younger brother. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS88
00:33:09,00 --> 00:33:18,50
SOMEONE<Michael> pours soda into his glass, then takes a sip through a straw. All the while, keeping a cold glare fixed on SOMEONE<Danny>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS89
00:34:04,00 --> 00:34:10,50
SOMEONE<Michael> sucks on his straw as if it's a cigarette. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS90
00:34:11,00 --> 00:34:17,50
The girl picks up her slice and winces at it. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS92
00:34:28,00 --> 00:34:33,50
A woman with mismatched breasts. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS93
00:34:31,00 --> 00:34:36,50
They go to the exam room. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS94
00:34:53,00 --> 00:34:59,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> meets his gaze, sheepishly. SOMEONE<Danny> grins. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS95
00:35:13,00 --> 00:35:18,50
He wags his finger in his chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS96
00:35:54,00 --> 00:35:59,50
SOMEONE<Danny> stares at SOMEONE<Katherine>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS97
00:36:07,00 --> 00:36:13,50
He reaches for her phone. She swats him away, then answers. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS98
00:36:23,00 --> 00:36:30,50
She ends the call. Returning to Mrs. Harrington, she finds SOMEONE<Danny> staring at her. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS99
00:37:12,00 --> 00:37:16,50
A lopsided bra. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS100
00:37:34,00 --> 00:37:39,50
He wiggles his finger from his chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS101
00:37:42,00 --> 00:37:47,50
Outside, JD McFunnigans. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS102
00:37:45,00 --> 00:37:50,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> steps out of her car in a tight dress. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS103
00:38:37,00 --> 00:38:45,50
In slow motion, SOMEONE<Danny>, SOMEONE<Katherine> and the kids try to cross the parking lot. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS104
00:38:44,00 --> 00:38:55,50
A boy holding a soda cup runs out in front of them. He stops and turns. As his pregnant mother catches up, he chucks the full cup at her and runs off. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS105
00:38:53,00 --> 00:39:00,50
Soaked with soda, the pregnant woman raises her hands overhand and yells after him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS106
00:39:00,00 --> 00:39:08,50
Everyone still moving in slow motion, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the kids watch the furious woman chase after her 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS108
00:39:10,00 --> 00:39:21,50
Inside, children run wildly through an elaborate play structure with tunnels, slides, and climbing ropes. SOMEONE<Danny> enters with SOMEONE<Katherine> and the kids. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS109
00:39:26,00 --> 00:39:33,50
A chubby boy trips and head-butts SOMEONE<Danny> in the crotch. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS110
00:39:44,00 --> 00:39:48,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> approaches. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS111
00:40:11,00 --> 00:40:15,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> stares at him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS112
00:40:18,00 --> 00:40:23,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> and SOMEONE<Danny> share a look. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS113
00:41:02,00 --> 00:41:06,50
She runs away. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS114
00:41:11,00 --> 00:41:17,50
SOMEONE<Danny> leaves and SOMEONE<Palmer> faces SOMEONE<Michael>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS115
00:41:21,00 --> 00:41:26,50
SOMEONE<Danny> follows SOMEONE<Maggie> through the play structure. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS116
00:41:50,00 --> 00:41:56,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> and SOMEONE<Palmer> look up from the floor. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS117
00:42:01,00 --> 00:42:06,50
A little boy sneezes on SOMEONE<Danny>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS119
00:42:22,00 --> 00:42:26,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> eyes him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS120
00:42:36,00 --> 00:42:40,50
She beams and takes a bite. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS121
00:42:40,00 --> 00:42:45,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> mouths, Thank you. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS122
00:43:37,00 --> 00:43:42,50
SOMEONE<Danny> returns. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS123
00:44:07,00 --> 00:44:13,50
SOMEONE<Michael> grins at him, then hangs his head and cries. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS124
00:44:10,00 --> 00:44:17,50
Now at LAX, SOMEONE<Danny> sits with SOMEONE<Katherine> and the kids in a busy airport terminal. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS125
00:45:05,00 --> 00:45:12,50
A bespectacled SOMEONE<Eddie> kisses SOMEONE<Katherine> on the lips until she pushes him off. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS126
00:45:59,00 --> 00:46:04,50
He wags his tongue, and SOMEONE<Katherine> catches it. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS127
00:46:06,00 --> 00:46:12,50
She drags him aside and wipes her hand on his vest. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS128
00:46:15,00 --> 00:46:20,50
He points to his round glasses. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS129
00:46:53,00 --> 00:46:57,50
SOMEONE<Danny> backhands him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS130
00:46:57,00 --> 00:47:03,50
Now a Hawaiian airliner soars over turquoise water. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS131
00:47:00,00 --> 00:47:08,50
On the island, a luxurious beachside resort boasts several swimming pools on its manicured grounds. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS132
00:47:06,00 --> 00:47:15,50
Beyond a large reflecting pool in the lobby, the family arrives. SOMEONE<Danny> approaches the registration desk. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS133
00:47:44,00 --> 00:47:50,50
SOMEONE<Danny> takes out his credit card then returns to the others. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS134
00:47:56,00 --> 00:48:15,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> and SOMEONE<Eddie> raise their hands. Now on a palm tree lined beach, SOMEONE<Palmer> steps out of the water in a yellow string bikini. SOMEONE<Eddie> and SOMEONE<Danny> check her out as they cross the sand. The voluptuous young woman brushes back her long blonde hair. Ogling her, SOMEONE<Eddie> lifts his round glasses. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS135
00:48:46,00 --> 00:48:53,50
SOMEONE<Eddie> walks his fingers up SOMEONE's<Katherine's> arm. Later outside a jewelry store. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS136
00:49:55,00 --> 00:50:02,50
Nighttime at a luau, fire dancers perform while the group eats dinner. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS137
00:50:34,00 --> 00:50:39,50
SOMEONE takes a pitcher from the waiter. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS138
00:51:16,00 --> 00:51:21,50
The kids swap a look. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS139
00:52:19,00 --> 00:52:24,50
The petite redhead flounces over. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS140
00:52:58,00 --> 00:53:03,50
He kisses SOMEONE's<Devlin's> cheek. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS141
00:54:53,00 --> 00:54:57,50
SOMEONE<Ian> squints at them. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS142
00:55:03,00 --> 00:55:07,50
The guys pound fists. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS143
00:56:01,00 --> 00:56:05,50
Dawn in the lobby. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS144
00:56:30,00 --> 00:56:36,50
Now in a lush tropical forest, the group hikes a trail. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS145
00:56:46,00 --> 00:56:54,50
The black-haired pig charges them and they run. SOMEONE<Danny> knocks SOMEONE<Eddie> down, and the pig steps on his back. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS146
00:56:56,00 --> 00:57:02,50
Later, the group hikes a narrow trail beside a canyon. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS147
00:56:59,00 --> 00:57:09,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> scales a steep hill, while the others lag behind. Hiking through bamboo stalks, she leads the group up another incline. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS148
00:57:06,00 --> 00:57:15,50
On a river, they paddle two-person canoes. Sitting behind SOMEONE<Palmer>, SOMEONE<Eddie> gawks at the exposed crack of her rear. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS149
00:57:13,00 --> 00:57:17,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> whacks him with her paddle. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS150
00:57:22,00 --> 00:57:29,50
Now as all six of them cross a rope bridge, a family of four spots them from below. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS151
00:57:34,00 --> 00:57:39,50
SOMEONE<Danny> stands at the tail end. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS152
00:57:38,00 --> 00:57:44,50
A board breaks, and he lands on a crossbeam, crotch first. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS154
00:57:52,00 --> 00:57:57,50
SOMEONE<Danny> chucks SOMEONE<Maggie> into a mud puddle. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS155
00:57:55,00 --> 00:58:01,50
She lifts her face from the sticky muck. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS156
00:58:01,00 --> 00:58:06,50
Now at a lagoon with a waterfall. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS157
00:58:19,00 --> 00:58:25,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> strips down to a skimpy string bikini. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS158
00:58:25,00 --> 00:58:30,50
She goes to the water's edge. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS159
00:58:35,00 --> 00:58:40,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> dives gracefully into the water. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS161
00:58:49,00 --> 00:58:54,50
SOMEONE<Maggie> approaches the water. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS162
00:59:06,00 --> 00:59:12,50
SOMEONE<Michael> shyly whispers to his mother. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS163
00:59:41,00 --> 00:59:47,50
On the far side of the lagoon, SOMEONE<Palmer> emerges from the water. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS164
00:59:45,00 --> 00:59:52,50
She picks her way over some jagged rocks, and stands beneath the waterfall. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS165
01:00:00,00 --> 01:00:05,50
He tries to high five SOMEONE<Michael>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS166
01:00:22,00 --> 01:00:29,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> strips down to a pink string bikini, revealing her tan slender body. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS167
01:00:26,00 --> 01:00:31,50
In slow motion, she saunters to the water. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS168
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:36,50
SOMEONE<Eddie> and SOMEONE<Danny> stare slack-jawed at SOMEONE's<Katherine's> well-toned figure. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS169
01:00:39,00 --> 01:00:45,50
SOMEONE<Eddie> steps away. SOMEONE<Katherine> picks her way out to a rocky point. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS170
01:00:49,00 --> 01:00:58,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> dives into the water. Cladding briefs with frogs printed on them, SOMEONE<Eddie> climbs rocks by the waterfall. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS171
01:00:57,00 --> 01:01:02,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> and SOMEONE<Palmer> lounge near-by. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS172
01:01:05,00 --> 01:01:10,50
He drops to the water, landing on his back. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS173
01:01:10,00 --> 01:01:16,50
Now back at the hotel, the group disembarks from a shuttle. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS174
01:01:44,00 --> 01:01:48,50
Evening in SOMEONE's<Danny's> suite. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS175
01:02:44,00 --> 01:02:49,50
He wags his finger from his chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS176
01:03:17,00 --> 01:03:22,50
As she leaves, SOMEONE<Eddie> approaches her in the hallway. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS177
01:03:21,00 --> 01:03:27,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> punches him in the gut and keeps walking. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS178
01:03:25,00 --> 01:03:29,50
Later in SOMEONE's<Danny's> suite. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS179
01:03:29,00 --> 01:03:34,50
SOMEONE<Maggie> draws a card and reads. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS180
01:04:07,00 --> 01:04:11,50
SOMEONE<Maggie> draws a card. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS181
01:04:29,00 --> 01:04:33,50
SOMEONE<Michael> shrugs. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS182
01:04:48,00 --> 01:04:53,50
As he cries, SOMEONE<Maggie> goes to comfort him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS183
01:04:51,00 --> 01:04:56,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> glares at SOMEONE<Danny>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS184
01:05:02,00 --> 01:05:06,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> storms off. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS185
01:05:09,00 --> 01:05:16,50
SOMEONE<Maggie> holds her crying brother in her arms. Turning, SOMEONE<Danny> smacks his shoulder. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS186
01:05:15,00 --> 01:05:19,50
Now he tucks them in. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS187
01:06:03,00 --> 01:06:07,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> looks in on them. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS188
01:06:30,00 --> 01:06:37,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> leaves. SOMEONE<Danny> shoves the kids back down on the bed. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS189
01:06:39,00 --> 01:06:45,50
Now on a putting green overlooking the ocean. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS190
01:08:17,00 --> 01:08:21,50
He gives her the putting flag. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS191
01:08:31,00 --> 01:08:40,50
The flag juts up from his butt cheeks. Now by the hotel pool, he wears water wings. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS192
01:08:42,00 --> 01:08:50,50
SOMEONE<Danny> tosses him into the pool. SOMEONE<Eddie> surfaces and scoops him up in his arms. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS193
01:08:55,00 --> 01:09:00,50
Later, SOMEONE<Danny> holds SOMEONE<Michael>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS194
01:09:07,00 --> 01:09:11,50
SOMEONE<Eddie> puppets a dolphin shaped cookie. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS195
01:09:25,00 --> 01:09:36,50
SOMEONE<Michael> flails his arms and kicks his legs. Slowly making his way towards the pool's edge. As he arrives, SOMEONE<Eddie> feeds him the cookie and tousles his wet hair. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS196
01:09:40,00 --> 01:09:44,50
At a spa. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS197
01:09:42,00 --> 01:09:46,50
The women get massages. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS198
01:10:37,00 --> 01:10:42,50
SOMEONE's<Katherine's> brow furrows. At the pool. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS199
01:10:53,00 --> 01:10:58,50
SOMEONE<Michael> takes off his water wings. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS200
01:11:12,00 --> 01:11:21,50
SOMEONE<Danny> tosses SOMEONE<Michael> from his arms, and the little boy flails and kicks his way across the pool. SOMEONE<Palmer> and SOMEONE<Katherine> arrive. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS201
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:27,50
SOMEONE's<Michael's> head dips below the water, and he lifts it back out. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS202
01:11:35,00 --> 01:11:44,50
SOMEONE<Michael> reaches the pool's edge, high fives his mother and grins broadly. SOMEONE<Danny> happily picks up SOMEONE<Maggie>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS203
01:11:53,00 --> 01:11:59,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> removes her sunglasses, and smiles lovingly at SOMEONE<Danny>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS204
01:11:56,00 --> 01:12:04,50
Beside her, SOMEONE<Katherine> takes off her shades and regards him with a fond gaze. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS205
01:12:05,00 --> 01:12:10,50
SOMEONE<Danny> drops SOMEONE<Maggie> in the water. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS206
01:12:21,00 --> 01:12:26,50
SOMEONE<Danny> urges SOMEONE<Eddie> to intervene. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS207
01:12:54,00 --> 01:12:59,50
SOMEONE<Eddie> shoves SOMEONE<Palmer> into the pool. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS208
01:12:59,00 --> 01:13:04,50
He jumps in the water, dunks her and holds her under. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS209
01:13:33,00 --> 01:13:38,50
He lets SOMEONE<Palmer> up, and she splashes him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS210
01:13:41,00 --> 01:13:46,50
In SOMEONE's<Danny's> suite, he talks on the phone. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS211
01:13:53,00 --> 01:14:02,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> emerges from the bathroom, wrapped in a towel. Reclining on a sofa, SOMEONE<Danny> struggles to sit up. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS212
01:14:23,00 --> 01:14:30,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> drops her towel. SOMEONE<Danny> tosses an apple between his hands. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS213
01:14:29,00 --> 01:14:34,50
He resumes his call. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS214
01:14:46,00 --> 01:14:53,50
SOMEONE<Danny> enters the bathroom. In the shower, SOMEONE<Palmer> dances and lip-syncs. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS215
01:14:57,00 --> 01:15:01,50
He switches off the music. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS216
01:15:04,00 --> 01:15:10,50
SOMEONE<Eddie> joins SOMEONE<Katherine>, eating a mango she thrusts the phone at him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS217
01:15:16,00 --> 01:15:20,50
She smacks him. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS218
01:15:53,00 --> 01:15:57,50
He ends the call. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS219
01:16:13,00 --> 01:16:20,50
She gestures to the bathroom, where a pillow and a blanket sit in the tub. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS220
01:16:17,00 --> 01:16:28,50
Now at an upscale restaurant, a woman gracefully hula dances to music by a live band. At a table, SOMEONE<Devlin> scrutinizes a wine list. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS221
01:17:04,00 --> 01:17:09,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> and SOMEONE<Ian> pout and rub noses. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS222
01:17:09,00 --> 01:17:19,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> notices SOMEONE<Danny> staring at his lap. She receives a text from him reading, I think they took one of your yellow bombers. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS223
01:17:16,00 --> 01:17:25,50
Glancing at the couple, she suppresses a grin. SOMEONE<Danny> receives her reply. I just hope their noses are clean. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS224
01:17:36,00 --> 01:17:43,50
Now a hybrid car pulls up to a dilapidated outdoor barbecue restaurant. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS225
01:18:00,00 --> 01:18:05,50
At dinner, SOMEONE<Danny> and SOMEONE<Katherine> swap a look. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS226
01:18:04,00 --> 01:18:09,50
The waitress pours wine. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS227
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:33,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> gapes. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS228
01:19:18,00 --> 01:19:22,50
He faces SOMEONE<Devlin>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS229
01:19:26,00 --> 01:19:31,50
They rub their noses together. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS230
01:19:31,00 --> 01:19:35,50
SOMEONE<Ian> leaves. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS231
01:19:49,00 --> 01:19:53,50
With SOMEONE<Eddie> and SOMEONE<Palmer>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS232
01:20:19,00 --> 01:20:25,50
The local girl leads them around back. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS233
01:20:23,00 --> 01:20:33,50
A crowd gathers. SOMEONE<Eddie> nervously approaches the white sheep, which lies on its side. He pokes it a few times. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS234
01:20:49,00 --> 01:20:53,50
With SOMEONE<Devlin>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS235
01:22:37,00 --> 01:22:42,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> mockingly mimes an overbite. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS236
01:23:33,00 --> 01:23:39,50
Gazing into his eyes, SOMEONE<Katherine> softly nods. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS237
01:23:36,00 --> 01:23:42,50
SOMEONE<Danny> meets her gaze, and nods as well. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS238
01:23:49,00 --> 01:23:57,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> and SOMEONE<Danny> shift in their seats. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Eddie> waves the limp sheep's legs. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS239
01:24:03,00 --> 01:24:09,50
He shoves hay in its mouth and grabs her udder. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS240
01:24:11,00 --> 01:24:15,50
He does CPR. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS241
01:24:16,00 --> 01:24:21,50
He drops his elbow into its belly. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS242
01:24:25,00 --> 01:24:29,50
He tries the Heimlich maneuver. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS243
01:24:34,00 --> 01:24:39,50
A plastic fish pops out, and the sheep walks away. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS244
01:24:38,00 --> 01:24:44,50
The girl hugs SOMEONE<Eddie>, then he gives her the Heimlich maneuver. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS245
01:25:37,00 --> 01:25:41,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> downs a shot. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS246
01:25:43,00 --> 01:25:47,50
She downs another. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS248
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:59,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> leads a group of ladies in bra tops and grass skirts. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS249
01:26:04,00 --> 01:26:12,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> re-positions herself center-stage in front of her rival. The ladies start to dance. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS250
01:26:19,00 --> 01:26:25,50
He holds his hand over an elderly woman. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS251
01:26:26,00 --> 01:26:31,50
As he guides her off stage, SOMEONE<Katherine> gives her a hug. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS252
01:26:39,00 --> 01:26:43,50
Tanner highlights SOMEONE<Devlin>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS253
01:26:45,00 --> 01:26:49,50
He moves on to SOMEONE<Katherine>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS254
01:26:53,00 --> 01:26:59,50
A heavy-set woman shimmies in a coconut top. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS255
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:04,50
She storms off. Only SOMEONE<Devlin> and SOMEONE<Katherine> remain. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS256
01:27:06,00 --> 01:27:12,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> raises her arms overhead and shakes her hips. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS257
01:27:11,00 --> 01:27:19,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> eyes SOMEONE<Devlin>, then matches her hip action. SOMEONE<Devlin> glares. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS258
01:27:16,00 --> 01:27:24,50
The tall redhead shakes her head and circles her bent arms, then points to SOMEONE<Katherine>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS259
01:27:23,00 --> 01:27:34,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> looks to SOMEONE<Danny>, who gestures forward to show off her own moves. She shrugs her shoulders, then does a break dancing arm wave, and stops facing SOMEONE<Devlin>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS260
01:27:33,00 --> 01:27:46,50
SOMEONE<Danny> opens his arms. SOMEONE<Devlin> glances at her opponent, then breaks into a lively Charleston, kicking up her heels. She twirls like a ballerina, then points back to SOMEONE<Katherine>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS261
01:27:46,00 --> 01:27:58,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> lowers her center of gravity, then mimes as though she were juggling. She juggles pretend balls behind her back, catches them in her bosom and throws one to SOMEONE<Devlin>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS262
01:28:00,00 --> 01:28:09,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> watches her rival. With her back to the crowd, SOMEONE<Devlin> gyrates her rear. Slow at first, then faster, and faster. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS263
01:28:08,00 --> 01:28:16,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> does the same, until SOMEONE<Devlin> does an aerial cartwheel, twirls and drops into a split. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS264
01:28:13,00 --> 01:28:19,50
She raises her arm in a final pose. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS265
01:28:21,00 --> 01:28:29,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> hulas in front of SOMEONE<Devlin>, then shakes her hips while raising her arms overhead. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS266
01:28:29,00 --> 01:28:37,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> pushes SOMEONE<Katherine> out of the way and poses again. She gets up and blows SOMEONE<Ian> kisses. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS268
01:29:02,00 --> 01:29:08,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> flashes her rear, and all of the men stand up. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS269
01:29:10,00 --> 01:29:15,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> grabs the mic. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS270
01:29:15,00 --> 01:29:21,50
Later, each couple holds a coconut between them. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS271
01:29:38,00 --> 01:29:44,50
Both couples struggle to raise their coconuts above their bellies. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS272
01:29:52,00 --> 01:29:59,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> kneels, resting the coconut at SOMEONE's<Danny's> waist on her cleavage. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS273
01:29:59,00 --> 01:30:05,50
SOMEONE's<Devlin's> chin holds the coconut at SOMEONE's<Ian's> crotch. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS274
01:30:04,00 --> 01:30:10,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> and SOMEONE<Danny> bring their coconut up to their chests. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS275
01:30:13,00 --> 01:30:19,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> and SOMEONE<Ian> drop their coconut on the floor. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS276
01:30:24,00 --> 01:30:29,50
SOMEONE<Ian> lowers his butt over the coconut. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS277
01:30:27,00 --> 01:30:33,50
He lifts the coconut off of the floor. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS278
01:30:37,00 --> 01:30:43,50
He waddles around, then lifts his backside to SOMEONE's<Devlin's> waist. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS279
01:30:46,00 --> 01:30:52,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> and SOMEONE<Danny> hold their coconut between their necks. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS280
01:31:04,00 --> 01:31:11,50
With their mouth under their coconut, SOMEONE<Katherine> pushes it up to SOMEONE's<Danny's> lips. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS281
01:31:12,00 --> 01:31:19,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> drops hers. With their eyes locked, SOMEONE<Katherine> and SOMEONE<Danny> let their coconut fall. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS282
01:31:20,00 --> 01:31:25,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> storms off. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS283
01:31:22,00 --> 01:31:27,50
SOMEONE<Ian> follows. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS285
01:31:50,00 --> 01:31:54,50
At SOMEONE's<Katherine's> door. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS286
01:33:25,00 --> 01:33:30,50
He wags his finger at his chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS287
01:34:00,00 --> 01:34:06,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> jolts, then hugs her kids. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS288
01:34:14,00 --> 01:34:19,50
An obese woman sleeps on a couch. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS289
01:34:39,00 --> 01:34:43,50
They shake hands. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS290
01:34:48,00 --> 01:34:55,50
As SOMEONE<Danny> walks away, SOMEONE<Katherine> slowly shuts the door to her suite. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS291
01:34:54,00 --> 01:35:02,50
Now SOMEONE<Danny> steps off of an elevator and crosses a hallway, with his hand shoved in his pockets. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS292
01:35:01,00 --> 01:35:08,50
At the end of another hall, he reaches the door to his own suite and stops. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS293
01:35:12,00 --> 01:35:21,50
Rounding a corner, he breaks into a run. SOMEONE<Danny> jogs back to the elevators and presses the call button. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS294
01:35:21,00 --> 01:35:25,50
SOMEONE<Palmer> and SOMEONE<Eddie> step out. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS295
01:36:13,00 --> 01:36:18,50
SOMEONE<Eddie> points to his ring finger. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS296
01:36:42,00 --> 01:36:48,50
The elevator opens and SOMEONE<Katherine> freezes. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS297
01:37:41,00 --> 01:37:47,50
She shares a gaze with SOMEONE<Danny> as the elevator doors close. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS298
01:37:45,00 --> 01:37:51,50
Later, we drift over a bed, to find SOMEONE<Danny> lying alone. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS299
01:37:49,00 --> 01:37:56,50
Staring thoughtfully, he fondles his wedding ring between his fingertips. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS300
01:37:54,00 --> 01:38:02,50
In the next room, SOMEONE<Palmer> tries on short white dresses while chatting on the phone. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS301
01:38:03,00 --> 01:38:12,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE<Katherine> lies awake in bed. She restlessly wipes her nose, and flips on her other side. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS302
01:38:12,00 --> 01:38:18,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE<Eddie> sleeps in the cramped tub. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS303
01:38:16,00 --> 01:38:22,50
As he turns on his side, his left hand lands in the toilet. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS304
01:38:21,00 --> 01:38:28,50
Later, SOMEONE<Palmer> lies sound asleep, resting her head on SOMEONE's<Danny's> shoulder. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS305
01:38:25,00 --> 01:38:31,50
He remains awake, staring blankly across the room. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS306
01:38:30,00 --> 01:38:36,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> lies awake in bed. SOMEONE<Maggie> rests beside her. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS307
01:38:37,00 --> 01:38:44,50
The brown-haired girl takes her mother's hand and rests her head on SOMEONE's<Katherine's> pillow. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS308
01:38:47,00 --> 01:38:55,50
Half asleep, SOMEONE<Michael> ambles into the bathroom, where SOMEONE<Eddie> still sleeps with his hand in the toilet. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS309
01:38:56,00 --> 01:39:05,50
The bed-headed boy drops his shorts, then sits on the bowl hunched forward with his arms dangling between his knees. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS310
01:39:07,00 --> 01:39:13,50
SOMEONE<Eddie> wakes, noticing his hand, and yanks it out of the bowl. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS311
01:39:14,00 --> 01:39:20,50
He grabs a towel and wraps his arm. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS312
01:39:24,00 --> 01:39:28,50
He storms out past the boy. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS313
01:39:27,00 --> 01:39:36,50
Later, SOMEONE<Danny> steps outside. Surrounded by tropical plants and lit candles, he makes a call on a portable phone. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS314
01:39:38,00 --> 01:39:43,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> answers a bedside phone. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS315
01:41:23,00 --> 01:41:28,50
SOMEONE<Danny> shakes his head. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS316
01:41:43,00 --> 01:41:48,50
SOMEONE<Danny> pensively rubs his chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS317
01:41:53,00 --> 01:42:00,50
Perched on the edge of a hot tub, SOMEONE<Danny> stares ahead and lowers the phone. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS318
01:41:58,00 --> 01:42:05,50
Now silhouetted against the moonlit ocean, a pod of dolphins leap from the water. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS320
01:42:03,00 --> 01:42:09,50
In the lobby, SOMEONE<Palmer> faces the concierge. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS321
01:42:14,00 --> 01:42:18,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> arrives nearby. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS322
01:42:22,00 --> 01:42:29,50
The blonde approaches wearing a white dress and a magnolia in her hair. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS323
01:43:24,00 --> 01:43:32,50
As SOMEONE<Palmer> hugs her, SOMEONE<Katherine> spies SOMEONE<Danny> helping her kids pick out clothes in a gift shop. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS324
01:43:30,00 --> 01:43:36,50
She watches him with wistful lovelorn gaze. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS325
01:43:33,00 --> 01:43:42,50
Now in an outdoor beachfront bar, SOMEONE<Katherine> finishes off a tropical cocktail, as the bartender brings her another. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS326
01:43:58,00 --> 01:44:03,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> sits beside SOMEONE<Katherine>. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS327
01:44:39,00 --> 01:44:44,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> sips a cocktail. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS328
01:45:07,00 --> 01:45:13,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> regards her with a sober frown. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS329
01:45:15,00 --> 01:45:20,50
SOMEONE<Devlin> shrugs her hand. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS330
01:45:21,00 --> 01:45:26,50
SOMEONE<Ian> checks up sailors. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS331
01:45:37,00 --> 01:45:44,50
Across the bar, SOMEONE<Ian> clownishly hula dances for the sailors. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS332
01:46:07,00 --> 01:46:11,50
The two women hug. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS333
01:46:12,00 --> 01:46:17,50
SOMEONE<Danny> sits next to them. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS334
01:46:27,00 --> 01:46:32,50
SOMEONE<Ian> doubles over laughing with the sailors. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS335
01:47:22,00 --> 01:47:26,50
He cocks his head patiently. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS336
01:48:07,00 --> 01:48:14,50
SOMEONE<Danny> tilts his head and grins. Beaming, SOMEONE<Katherine> shakes her head fondly. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS337
01:48:11,00 --> 01:48:19,50
Her old friend gives a small nod. Leaning in, she gives him a passionate kiss. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS338
01:48:17,00 --> 01:48:22,50
The sailors and SOMEONE<Ian> watch. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS339
01:48:22,00 --> 01:48:28,50
Now in a life-vest, SOMEONE<Michael> faces a dolphin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS340
01:48:33,00 --> 01:48:38,50
Two push him through the water with their noses. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS341
01:48:36,00 --> 01:48:40,50
On an airplane. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS342
01:48:43,00 --> 01:48:47,50
Now at a wedding reception. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS343
01:48:49,00 --> 01:48:53,50
SOMEONE<Danny> sits alone. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS344
01:49:18,00 --> 01:49:27,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> leads him to the dance floor. Nearby, SOMEONE<Eddie> clownishly poses for photos with a gaggle of attractive young women. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS345
01:49:25,00 --> 01:49:31,50
Slow dancing with his wife, SOMEONE<Danny> eyes the stage. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS346
01:49:33,00 --> 01:49:40,50
SOMEONE<Brian> sports a long soul patch. SOMEONE<Danny> wags his finger from his chin. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS347
01:49:39,00 --> 01:49:47,50
SOMEONE<Brian> grimaces as he plays. His inches long pillar of facial hair waving in a breeze. He makes the gesture again. 

JUST_GO_WITH_IT_DVS348
01:49:49,00 --> 01:50:00,50
Grinning, SOMEONE<Katherine> pulls him close. The couple sways happily in unison as their friends and loved ones celebrate around them.
