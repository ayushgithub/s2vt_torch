LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS13
00:03:13,00 --> 00:03:18,50
SOMEONE<Andi> gives SOMEONE<Greg> a bemused frown. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS14
00:04:28,00 --> 00:04:32,50
Muffled click. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS15
00:04:58,00 --> 00:05:04,50
In the ward, a male nurse tends to a burly patient on his side. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS16
00:06:11,00 --> 00:06:15,50
SOMEONE's<Andi's> gloved hand twist the tube. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS17
00:06:24,00 --> 00:06:28,50
SOMEONE<Louis> frowns. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS18
00:06:27,00 --> 00:06:31,50
Where SOMEONE<Andi> and SOMEONE<Greg> sanitize their hands. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS19
00:07:01,00 --> 00:07:06,50
They bump fists. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS20
00:07:09,00 --> 00:07:41,50
Now at the SOMEONE'<Byrnes'> two-story colonial, a red family crest hangs in SOMEONE's<Jack's> basement layer. It reads, Certavi et Vici Byrnes. A framed photo shows SOMEONE<Jack> with a Bedouin, dressed as a Bedouin. In another, he shoulder-to-shoulder with President SOMEONE<George> W. Bush. Sepia-toned photo shows dates, men, and officers resembling SOMEONE<Jack>. A shelf holds books on genealogy. On a bulletin board, headshots form a smartly right-angled family tree. SOMEONE<Jack> frowns at photos of Deborah Banks and Dr. Robert Banks. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS21
00:07:40,00 --> 00:07:48,50
He takes down Robert's photo. Now in their bedroom, SOMEONE<Dina> packs a suitcase. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS22
00:08:24,00 --> 00:08:29,50
Holds his chest but quickly smiles. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS23
00:08:44,00 --> 00:08:51,50
Now as SOMEONE<Greg> drives, his cell reads incoming call. Mom Focker.  

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS24
00:08:49,00 --> 00:08:55,50
On a studio. The Bohemian mother talks on the phone. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS25
00:11:05,00 --> 00:11:12,50
SOMEONE<Greg> tosses earpiece aside. In his layer, SOMEONE<Jack> honkers at his desk. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS26
00:11:10,00 --> 00:11:28,50
Using an X-ACTO knife, he neatly cuts a wedding picture of Dr. SOMEONE<Bob> and SOMEONE<Deborah> down the middle. He folds Dr. SOMEONE's<Bob's> half, tears it in two, and shoves it in a wastebasket. Eyeing SOMEONE's<Deborah's> photo, the ex-CIA agent rubs his chest. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS27
00:11:27,00 --> 00:11:33,50
He places two fingers alongside his carotid. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS28
00:11:32,00 --> 00:11:40,50
As his Siamese cat eyes him from a footstool, SOMEONE<Jack> dials his cellphone. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS29
00:11:53,00 --> 00:12:00,50
SOMEONE<Jack> turns on his polygraph machine then tears open his button down. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS31
00:12:02,00 --> 00:12:06,50
The cat observes. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS32
00:12:47,00 --> 00:12:51,50
SOMEONE<Kevin> Skypes them from a yacht. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS33
00:13:31,00 --> 00:13:36,50
Bikini clog beauty approaches SOMEONE<Kevin>. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS34
00:13:44,00 --> 00:13:48,50
Nuzzling and kissing him. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS35
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:07,50
SOMEONE<Greg> watches SOMEONE<Kevin> give the departing hottie a playful smack on the rear. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS36
00:15:19,00 --> 00:15:23,50
SOMEONE's<Henry's> lasagna. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS37
00:15:59,00 --> 00:16:03,50
SOMEONE<Greg> glances at his family. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS38
00:16:14,00 --> 00:16:18,50
He enters a bedroom. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS39
00:17:16,00 --> 00:17:21,50
SOMEONE<Jack> swivels in his chair. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS40
00:17:44,00 --> 00:17:49,50
SOMEONE<Greg> lifts his brow. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS41
00:18:13,00 --> 00:18:18,50
He points to a photo of SOMEONE<Greg> on the family tree. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS42
00:18:40,00 --> 00:18:45,50
SOMEONE<Greg> shifts his thoughtful gaze. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS43
00:18:43,00 --> 00:18:48,50
We view him through window blinds. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS44
00:18:51,00 --> 00:18:56,50
He stares unflinchingly. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS45
00:19:11,00 --> 00:19:21,50
Gazing out the window, SOMEONE<Greg> lowers his phone. With a strange smile, he strolls back into the kitchen where SOMEONE<Pam> looks over. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS46
00:19:22,00 --> 00:19:26,50
He lifts her brow. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS47
00:19:38,00 --> 00:19:42,50
SOMEONE<Greg> eyes his daughter. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS48
00:19:41,00 --> 00:19:48,50
Chewing her food, she turns away. SOMEONE<Greg> shifts his gaze to his son, SOMEONE<Henry>. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS49
00:19:46,00 --> 00:19:50,50
He looks up. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS50
00:19:49,00 --> 00:19:56,50
With a calm look, SOMEONE<Greg> sits beside SOMEONE<Henry>, his hands folded. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS51
00:20:02,00 --> 00:20:06,50
SOMEONE<Greg> holds up quieting fingers. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS52
00:20:04,00 --> 00:20:08,50
SOMEONE<Pam> closes her mouth. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS53
00:20:12,00 --> 00:20:16,50
He eyes him firmly. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS54
00:20:15,00 --> 00:20:19,50
SOMEONE<Henry> takes a small bite. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS55
00:20:18,00 --> 00:20:24,50
As SOMEONE<Greg> gives a satisfied look, SOMEONE<Henry> vomits. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS56
00:20:26,00 --> 00:20:30,50
Daytime, puffy clouds. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS59
00:20:58,00 --> 00:21:05,50
Its window, he opens it then jogs across the street to the SOMEONE'<Byrnes'> car. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS60
00:21:20,00 --> 00:21:28,50
With one hand on SOMEONE's<Jack's> waist and the other on his neck, SOMEONE<Greg> kisses both of the older man's cheeks. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS61
00:21:38,00 --> 00:21:44,50
He slaps his hands to SOMEONE's<Jack's> face and kisses him again. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS62
00:21:42,00 --> 00:21:47,50
Later at the dinner table. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS63
00:22:11,00 --> 00:22:15,50
SOMEONE<Henry> picks up his glass. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS64
00:22:34,00 --> 00:22:39,50
He winks at SOMEONE<Jack> then leaves. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS65
00:23:32,00 --> 00:23:37,50
He takes it out. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS66
00:23:51,00 --> 00:23:56,50
SOMEONE's<Jack's> smile disappears. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS67
00:24:15,00 --> 00:24:20,50
As he carves, SOMEONE<Arthur> peeks over the table. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS68
00:24:25,00 --> 00:24:30,50
SOMEONE<Jack> winces as SOMEONE<Greg> mangles the bird. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS70
00:25:30,00 --> 00:25:37,50
SOMEONE<Pam> takes his hand. SOMEONE<Kevin> places his other one over it. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS71
00:25:40,00 --> 00:25:44,50
SOMEONE<Kevin> gazes at her. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS72
00:26:09,00 --> 00:26:14,50
SOMEONE<Jack> and SOMEONE<Dina> turn to SOMEONE<Greg>. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS73
00:26:36,00 --> 00:26:43,50
He squeezes the back of SOMEONE's<Henry's> neck and the boy goes limp, his eyes closed. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS74
00:26:46,00 --> 00:26:51,50
He sets him on the couch. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS75
00:28:29,00 --> 00:28:34,50
SOMEONE<Greg> sets a hand on SOMEONE's<Kevin's> other shoulder. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS76
00:28:36,00 --> 00:28:41,50
They both pat his face. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS77
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:46,50
Morning, SOMEONE<Greg> feels SOMEONE's<Pam's> flushed brow as she lies in bed. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS78
00:29:01,00 --> 00:29:06,50
He and SOMEONE<Jack> drive into the city. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS79
00:29:48,00 --> 00:29:53,50
SOMEONE<Greg> rumples his lips into a frown. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS80
00:30:34,00 --> 00:30:39,50
SOMEONE's<Jack's> face hardens. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS81
00:30:38,00 --> 00:30:51,50
Now, a handful of children play in the courtyard of a glass-paneled building. Inside an auditorium, a blonde woman grins at the audience as she strolls on stage. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS82
00:30:54,00 --> 00:30:58,50
A slide show starts. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS83
00:30:58,00 --> 00:31:03,50
A photo shows surgeons. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS84
00:31:20,00 --> 00:31:25,50
Children sketch a shirtless model. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS85
00:31:42,00 --> 00:31:48,50
In the courtyard, young children in cheerleading uniforms do backflip. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS86
00:32:19,00 --> 00:32:24,50
They give confused looks. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS87
00:32:56,00 --> 00:33:01,50
Their smiles fade. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS88
00:33:49,00 --> 00:34:00,50
Later, they pull up to the new house where some construction workers take a break in the yard. A dump truck of sand sits in the driveway. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS89
00:34:05,00 --> 00:34:10,50
An orange sports car zooms past 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS90
00:34:07,00 --> 00:34:15,50
Then swings into a U-turn and parks behind SOMEONE's<Greg's> car. SOMEONE<Kevin> climbs out. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS91
00:37:00,00 --> 00:37:04,50
He hops at the bottom of the drive. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS92
00:37:06,00 --> 00:37:12,50
He hits door, sand cascades onto SOMEONE. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS93
00:37:10,00 --> 00:37:14,50
SOMEONE<Greg> race over. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS94
00:37:25,00 --> 00:37:29,50
He supports SOMEONE's head. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS95
00:37:33,00 --> 00:37:37,50
SOMEONE<Jack> glares. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS96
00:37:35,00 --> 00:37:39,50
Later, SOMEONE<Dina> swabs his ears. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS97
00:38:38,00 --> 00:38:42,50
SOMEONE<Dina> touches his cheek. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS98
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:47,50
SOMEONE<Greg> returns to the phone. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS99
00:40:12,00 --> 00:40:17,50
SOMEONE<Sam> listens from under the bed. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS100
00:40:15,00 --> 00:40:23,50
Later, SOMEONE<Jack> sits with her as she pretends to shoot green toy soldiers with tan ones. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS101
00:40:45,00 --> 00:40:50,50
SOMEONE<Sam> nods. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS102
00:41:02,00 --> 00:41:07,50
SOMEONE's<Jack's> eyes shift. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS103
00:41:10,00 --> 00:41:15,50
Later, SOMEONE<Greg> arrives at home. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS104
00:41:27,00 --> 00:41:31,50
Sees SOMEONE<Greg> stow a bag in a closet. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS105
00:42:00,00 --> 00:42:26,50
As SOMEONE<Greg> hurries down the hall, SOMEONE<Jack> glares after him. On a table, SOMEONE's<Greg's> phone vibrates. Turning to it, SOMEONE<Jack> reads a text from SOMEONE<Andi>, Can't wait to see you at the hotel tonight. Later SOMEONE<Greg> walks outside, his briefcase clutched in one hand. SOMEONE<Jack> sneaks after him, disguised in a windbreaker and bucket hat. As SOMEONE<Greg> glances back, his father-in-law steps into some shadows. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS107
00:42:33,00 --> 00:42:37,50
SOMEONE<Greg> peers back around the corner. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS112
00:43:17,00 --> 00:43:24,50
Frowning, SOMEONE<Greg> sticks his head outside and glances up and down the platform. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS115
00:43:36,00 --> 00:43:41,50
Door to SOMEONE's<Greg's> train car, SOMEONE<Jack> steps inside. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS116
00:43:45,00 --> 00:43:49,50
SOMEONE<Greg> appears behind him. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS117
00:43:47,00 --> 00:43:51,50
Turns around. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS118
00:44:13,00 --> 00:44:19,50
He stares at SOMEONE<Jack>, who gives a halfhearted smile. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS121
00:44:57,00 --> 00:45:02,50
They enter a convention room. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS122
00:45:19,00 --> 00:45:25,50
Narrowing his eyes, SOMEONE<Greg> shifts them mischievously. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS123
00:45:23,00 --> 00:45:36,50
At the apartment, SOMEONE<Jack> turns on a light in the coat closet. He crouches then inspects SOMEONE's<Greg's> hidden bag. With a furrowed brow, he finds pamphlets for Sustengo then removes a sample box. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS124
00:45:34,00 --> 00:45:42,50
As he reads it, SOMEONE<Dina> creeps up behind him wearing a trench coat over a negligee. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS125
00:45:54,00 --> 00:45:58,50
She kisses his cheek. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS126
00:46:06,00 --> 00:46:11,50
She unzips his jacket and he frowns. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS127
00:46:39,00 --> 00:46:51,50
She kisses her finger then blows him the kiss. As she leaves, SOMEONE<Jack> eyes the sample box of Sustengo. Now at a bar, three doctors approach SOMEONE<Greg>. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS128
00:47:14,00 --> 00:47:18,50
He strolls over. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS129
00:48:18,00 --> 00:48:23,50
He wanders over to the bar. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS130
00:49:03,00 --> 00:49:08,50
SOMEONE<Greg> lifts his gaze to SOMEONE's<Bob's> face. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS131
00:49:30,00 --> 00:49:39,50
SOMEONE<Bob> gives a nod and SOMEONE<Greg> looks away. Later, SOMEONE<Greg> opens the apartment door and steps into the dark living room. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS132
00:49:38,00 --> 00:49:47,50
As he slides off his coat, a lamp shines its light on him. SOMEONE<Jack> sits in an armchair beside it. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS133
00:49:45,00 --> 00:49:49,50
SOMEONE<Greg> shields his eyes. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS134
00:49:51,00 --> 00:49:57,50
SOMEONE<Jack> holds up the box of Sustengo. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS135
00:50:01,00 --> 00:50:05,50
SOMEONE<Jack> brightens the light. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS136
00:50:09,00 --> 00:50:14,50
SOMEONE<Greg> hangs up his coat. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS137
00:50:20,00 --> 00:50:28,50
As SOMEONE<Jack> rises, SOMEONE<Greg> stops and turns to him. He points to SOMEONE's<Jack's> crotch. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS138
00:50:39,00 --> 00:50:43,50
SOMEONE<Greg> steps closer. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS139
00:51:27,00 --> 00:51:34,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE<Greg> pulls on Latex gloves then opens the needle and syringe. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS140
00:51:32,00 --> 00:51:37,50
He gestures at the bulge in SOMEONE's<Jack's> pants. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS141
00:51:52,00 --> 00:51:57,50
His shoulders heave as he reaches toward SOMEONE<Jack>. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS142
00:51:59,00 --> 00:52:06,50
As he readies the needle, two slippered feet walk down the hall. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS143
00:52:04,00 --> 00:52:08,50
SOMEONE<Henry> heads to the bathroom. He holds the knob. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS145
00:52:16,00 --> 00:52:22,50
He congests himself as he walks down the hall toward SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS146
00:52:33,00 --> 00:52:41,50
He gives two thumbs up then heads away. SOMEONE<Pam> looks at her mother and winces. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS147
00:52:42,00 --> 00:52:47,50
Now, SOMEONE<Greg> tucks SOMEONE<Henry> in. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS148
00:53:16,00 --> 00:53:22,50
SOMEONE<Jack> lets SOMEONE<Greg> shut the door then enters anyway. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS149
00:53:24,00 --> 00:53:29,50
SOMEONE<Jack> stands by. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS150
00:53:36,00 --> 00:53:41,50
SOMEONE<Jack> glowers. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS151
00:53:58,00 --> 00:54:04,50
Later in the hallway, SOMEONE<Greg> gently shuts SOMEONE's<Henry's> door. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS152
00:54:21,00 --> 00:54:31,50
Without breaking eye contact, the two men circle. SOMEONE<Greg> gives a mock scowl. He and SOMEONE<Jack> back away from each other. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS153
00:54:30,00 --> 00:54:41,50
SOMEONE<Jack> tauntingly shrugs his hands apart. SOMEONE<Greg> does the same. SOMEONE<Jack> repeats the gesture. Then they go their separate ways. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS154
00:54:39,00 --> 00:54:47,50
Daytime, SOMEONE<Jack> peers out the cracked open door of the guest bedroom while on his cell. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS155
00:55:04,00 --> 00:55:08,50
He glances back. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS156
00:55:32,00 --> 00:56:04,50
Later at a computer, SOMEONE<Jack> types A-N-D-I-G-A-R-C-I-A into the Google search field and gets back image results and links for the handsome dark-haired actor. He adds the keyword, Chicago and finds a link to a Myspace profile. Leaning in, SOMEONE<Jack> opens the zebra print page then scrolls down to find the photo of SOMEONE<Andi> kissing SOMEONE<Greg> on the cheek. The retired CIA man reads the caption, "Crazy night at the Hilton. " He minimizes the page as SOMEONE enters. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS158
00:56:22,00 --> 00:56:29,50
SOMEONE<Greg> joins the rest of the family. SOMEONE<Jack> checks his watch. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS159
00:56:29,00 --> 00:56:33,50
SOMEONE<Pam> gives them a kiss. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS161
00:56:52,00 --> 00:56:57,50
The vehicles park and they step out. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS162
00:57:22,00 --> 00:57:34,50
SOMEONE<Kevin> lifts his shirt to reveal his lower back. The other study a large tattoo of SOMEONE's<Pam's> smiling face above the banner, forever. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS163
00:58:07,00 --> 00:58:11,50
It's only half of SOMEONE's<Greg's> face. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS164
00:58:28,00 --> 00:58:33,50
Later in SOMEONE's<Prudence's> office. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS165
00:58:58,00 --> 00:59:03,50
They swap an icy look. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS166
00:59:07,00 --> 00:59:12,50
Now, SOMEONE<Henry> sits in an easel. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS167
00:59:10,00 --> 00:59:15,50
The family watches behind a mirrored window. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS168
00:59:20,00 --> 00:59:25,50
She shows SOMEONE<Sam> a phony eye chart. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS169
00:59:33,00 --> 00:59:37,50
SOMEONE<Prudence> starts the timer. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS170
00:59:50,00 --> 00:59:53,50
Back at the easel. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS171
00:59:53,00 --> 00:59:57,50
SOMEONE<Prudence> recoils. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS172
00:59:55,00 --> 01:00:01,50
A stick figure holds a syringe to another's penis. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS173
01:00:13,00 --> 01:00:20,50
SOMEONE<Prudence> frowns. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS174
01:00:37,00 --> 01:00:41,50
SOMEONE<Sam> smiles proudly toward the mirrored window. SOMEONE<Prudence> gapes. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS176
01:01:37,00 --> 01:01:42,50
On the playground. They spot a surveillance camera. The boy glares at his dad. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS179
01:02:50,00 --> 01:02:54,50
SOMEONE<Henry> beams. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS180
01:03:15,00 --> 01:03:20,50
Now, SOMEONE<Greg> approaches the nurses' station. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS181
01:03:28,00 --> 01:03:32,50
SOMEONE pulls him aside. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS183
01:08:16,00 --> 01:08:20,50
Back in the hall. SOMEONE<Dina> emerges. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS184
01:08:20,00 --> 01:08:26,50
SOMEONE<Dina> eyes SOMEONE<Jack>, who holds an arm around SOMEONE<Pam>. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS185
01:08:24,00 --> 01:08:29,50
SOMEONE<Greg> presses the elevator button. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS188
01:08:56,00 --> 01:09:00,50
He park at the new house's driveway. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS190
01:09:34,00 --> 01:09:41,50
She leaves and SOMEONE<Jack> stares ahead. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS191
01:09:40,00 --> 01:09:50,50
Now in the new house, SOMEONE<Greg> stands alone in the middle of an unfinished room. SOMEONE<Greg> turns away from a three-foot hole in the wall and crosses to the front door, where he finds SOMEONE<Andi> with a bottle of wine. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS198
01:11:52,00 --> 01:11:59,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE's<Jack's> car arrives out front. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS199
01:11:58,00 --> 01:12:04,50
The retired CIA agent gets out and marches gravely toward the house. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS200
01:12:02,00 --> 01:12:11,50
Glancing aside, he pauses and stares. His flashlight beam hits the license plate of SOMEONE's<Andi's> convertible. It reads, "RX GRRRL. " 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS201
01:12:09,00 --> 01:12:15,50
Killing his light, SOMEONE<Jack> creeps around toward the side of the house. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS203
01:12:31,00 --> 01:12:38,50
As SOMEONE<Jack> moves through the shadows outside, SOMEONE<Andi> takes off her blouse. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS204
01:12:46,00 --> 01:12:57,50
SOMEONE<Andi> pounces on him. Outside, SOMEONE<Jack> pauses and turns. Finding a bay window, he steps close and peeks in. He sees SOMEONE<Andi> in her bra and skirt. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS206
01:13:46,00 --> 01:13:51,50
Her arms and legs wrapped around SOMEONE<Greg> as she smothers him with kisses. His hands clenching her waist. He spins around the room erratically. SOMEONE<Jack> looks away. His gaze heartbroken. He backs away from the window. He licks his lips, presses them tight, and leaves. Inside, lands - they knock heads - cut to black. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS207
01:14:55,00 --> 01:14:59,50
His legs clad in white pants. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS208
01:15:01,00 --> 01:15:13,50
In the pit, SOMEONE<Greg> snores under SOMEONE<Andi>. His eyes blink open and he gets his bearings. As SOMEONE<Bernie> arrives out back, SOMEONE's<Greg's> hand slaps down on the pit's rim. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS209
01:15:11,00 --> 01:15:16,50
Straining with effort, he pulls himself up. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS210
01:15:36,00 --> 01:15:41,50
SOMEONE<Bernie> stares and points at her. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS211
01:16:41,00 --> 01:16:45,50
At the birthday party. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS213
01:17:02,00 --> 01:17:06,50
SOMEONE<Sam> nods. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS214
01:17:19,00 --> 01:17:23,50
SOMEONE<Sam> frowns. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS216
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:18,50
SOMEONE<Greg> leaves his car with the valet. A monk greets him. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS217
01:18:18,00 --> 01:18:24,50
Approach chauffeured carts. Passing a valet stand, SOMEONE<Bernie> pauses to dance. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS218
01:18:50,00 --> 01:18:55,50
He's off in a cart. SOMEONE<Bernie> stretches his quadriceps. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS219
01:19:02,00 --> 01:19:07,50
Clinging by his legs, he opens his arms. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS220
01:19:10,00 --> 01:19:15,50
SOMEONE<Pam> turns and sees SOMEONE<Greg> approaching. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS221
01:19:55,00 --> 01:20:00,50
SOMEONE<Sam> grins. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS223
01:20:08,00 --> 01:20:13,50
SOMEONE<Greg> opens a shoebox. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS224
01:20:17,00 --> 01:20:22,50
Kissing as the twins hug them. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS225
01:20:21,00 --> 01:20:26,50
He starts to cry. His tears landing on the stage below. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS226
01:20:29,00 --> 01:20:33,50
He gets dizzily to his feet. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS227
01:20:39,00 --> 01:20:47,50
As he hobbles off, a boy offers him his cotton candy. SOMEONE<Kevin> takes it and goes to a tent. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS228
01:20:45,00 --> 01:20:51,50
Roz peeks inside and finds him sitting pensively. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS229
01:20:59,00 --> 01:21:04,50
Now, SOMEONE<Greg> approaches SOMEONE<Jack>, who sits. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS230
01:21:05,00 --> 01:21:09,50
SOMEONE<Jack> lifts his chin. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS231
01:21:07,00 --> 01:21:12,50
SOMEONE<Greg> eyes the drawing. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS232
01:21:11,00 --> 01:21:16,50
SOMEONE<Jack> scowls, holding a balloon. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS233
01:21:32,00 --> 01:21:39,50
With a smile, he holds out a plate of cake. SOMEONE<Jack> punches him in the nose. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS234
01:21:38,00 --> 01:21:42,50
He punches him again. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS235
01:21:40,00 --> 01:21:47,50
SOMEONE<Greg> blocks a strike then hits SOMEONE<Jack> in the face. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS236
01:21:48,00 --> 01:21:53,50
SOMEONE<Jack> slides off his jacket. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS237
01:21:55,00 --> 01:21:59,50
Pump his fists. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS238
01:22:02,00 --> 01:22:07,50
He punches him then beckons. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS239
01:22:05,00 --> 01:22:09,50
Removes his sweatshirt. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS240
01:22:09,00 --> 01:22:17,50
SOMEONE<Greg> raises his fists and the two men face off. As SOMEONE<Greg> throws a punch, SOMEONE<Jack> blocks him. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS241
01:22:18,00 --> 01:22:27,50
To push him away. The older man flings him into a giant ball pit. SOMEONE<Greg> disappears below the balls. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS243
01:22:29,00 --> 01:22:35,50
He glances around but sees only the playing 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS244
01:22:35,00 --> 01:22:39,50
Behind him move then stop as he whip 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS245
01:22:38,00 --> 01:22:42,50
They shift in another part of the pit. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS246
01:22:49,00 --> 01:22:55,50
SOMEONE<Greg> notices and stares with intense eyes. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS249
01:23:05,00 --> 01:23:11,50
Other balls shift and SOMEONE<Greg> turns to them. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS250
01:23:08,00 --> 01:23:13,50
Behind him, SOMEONE<Jack> burst through the surface. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS251
01:23:15,00 --> 01:23:19,50
Punches him. He grabs his son-in-law. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS253
01:23:42,00 --> 01:23:47,50
Pulled over, SOMEONE kicks his leg back and hits again to a bouncy castle.  

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS255
01:23:59,00 --> 01:24:04,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Henry> looks in the shoebox. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS256
01:24:06,00 --> 01:24:14,50
In the grass, SOMEONE<Arthur> faces Jinx, who stares at him. The cat licks its lips then advances. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS257
01:24:12,00 --> 01:24:19,50
He sniffs the lizard. Now, SOMEONE<Jack> throws himself

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS259
01:24:33,00 --> 01:24:37,50
Dangling for Jinx's mouth. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS260
01:24:39,00 --> 01:24:47,50
As SOMEONE<Greg> races past him after the cat, SOMEONE<Jack> stops. His chest heaving. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS261
01:24:47,00 --> 01:24:51,50
He stretches his shoulders back. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS262
01:25:01,00 --> 01:25:06,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Kevin> kisses her. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS264
01:25:11,00 --> 01:25:16,50
SOMEONE<Bernie> lowers his arms. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS265
01:25:58,00 --> 01:26:09,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Greg> races after Jinx. He stops. SOMEONE<Jack> lies on the ground clutching his chest. She sprints over. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS267
01:26:32,00 --> 01:26:36,50
His cat approaching. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS268
01:26:36,00 --> 01:26:43,50
Pushing the cat's stomach like the Heimlich maneuver, he forces the lizard out. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS269
01:26:44,00 --> 01:26:50,50
SOMEONE<Henry> grabs SOMEONE<Arthur> and SOMEONE<Greg> returns his gaze to SOMEONE<Jack>. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS270
01:26:49,00 --> 01:26:54,50
He rubs SOMEONE's<Jack's> shoulder. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS271
01:26:53,00 --> 01:26:58,50
Later, Medics wheel SOMEONE<Jack> to an ambulance. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS272
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:02,50
He gives SOMEONE a look. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS273
01:27:19,00 --> 01:27:24,50
SOMEONE<medic> winks. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS274
01:27:22,00 --> 01:27:26,50
In the ambulance. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS275
01:27:29,00 --> 01:27:33,50
Again looks at SOMEONE<Greg>. SOMEONE<Medic> replaces the mask. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS278
01:28:13,00 --> 01:28:18,50
He smiles as he holds SOMEONE's<Greg's> gaze. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS279
01:28:17,00 --> 01:28:23,50
He pats SOMEONE's<Greg's> cheek. His smile growing wider. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS280
01:28:22,00 --> 01:28:27,50
SOMEONE<Greg> gives him a tender look. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS281
01:28:27,00 --> 01:28:31,50
SOMEONE<Jack> winks at him. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS282
01:28:33,00 --> 01:28:37,50
They lift the stretcher into their ridge. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS284
01:28:44,00 --> 01:28:52,50
Now, snowfalls onto a group of SOMEONEers<carolers>. Words appear, "Four Months Later. " 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS286
01:29:16,00 --> 01:29:20,50
SOMEONE<Jack> frowns. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS287
01:29:19,00 --> 01:29:23,50
He lifts his leg. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS288
01:31:28,00 --> 01:31:34,50
Now in his basement lair, SOMEONE<Jack> types on a computer. 

LITTLE_FOCKERS_DVS289
01:31:38,00 --> 01:31:59,50
As Jinx looks on, SOMEONE<Jack> types his name into a Google search window. He trails his cursor over the search results then selects a YouTube video. It's title, Nurse Rags on Psycho Father-in-Law. The image loads up showing SOMEONE<Greg> speaking at the medical convention. SOMEONE<Jack> scowls. The video plays.
