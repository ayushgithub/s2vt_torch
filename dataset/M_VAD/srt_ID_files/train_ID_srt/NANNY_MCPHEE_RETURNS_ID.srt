NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS7
00:02:51,00 --> 00:02:54,50
The oldest listens intently. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS8
00:03:09,00 --> 00:03:13,50
A blonde boy vomits. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS10
00:03:37,00 --> 00:03:42,50
They pass a pristine white, estate house. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS11
00:03:41,00 --> 00:03:46,50
SOMEONE<Blenkinsop> takes a deep breath. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS12
00:03:45,00 --> 00:03:50,50
In a muddy yard a fallen sign reads - Deep Valley. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS13
00:03:48,00 --> 00:03:53,50
Fresh plops of manure splat between the cows. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS14
00:03:52,00 --> 00:04:01,50
Dirty water gets launched from a barn doorway. Then the farm girl emerges visibly mucking a stall. Her older brother totes buckets 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS16
00:04:12,00 --> 00:04:18,50
and the bellows. Flywheels and belts turn an axle. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS17
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:23,50
A horizontal assembly of pipes is shaped like a castle 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS19
00:05:02,00 --> 00:05:17,50
The elevator drops down to one and the piglets stand. Now, the children's mother hurries down a narrow road, buttoning a cardigan beneath her inside-out overcoat. On a nearby wall, a coal black jackdaw squawks at her. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS20
00:05:16,00 --> 00:05:23,50
It waddles alongside her a few paces then opens its beak. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS21
00:05:21,00 --> 00:05:26,50
The bird flies toward her. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS22
00:06:22,00 --> 00:06:26,50
She enters a store. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS23
00:06:30,00 --> 00:06:35,50
An old woman peeks from behinda counter. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS24
00:07:02,00 --> 00:07:07,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> joins her behind the counter. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS25
00:07:07,00 --> 00:07:11,50
It's piled waist high. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS26
00:07:10,00 --> 00:07:14,50
She appears stuck in a snowdrift of flour. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS27
00:07:13,00 --> 00:07:19,50
Now, SOMEONE<Phil> passes a hedged in path. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS28
00:07:16,00 --> 00:07:25,50
He doubles back. A hand seizes him. He faces two platinum blondes - one large, one small. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS29
00:07:49,00 --> 00:07:53,50
He tries to climb over the wall, but fails. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS30
00:08:25,00 --> 00:08:41,50
Now, a vast field of golden barley wavers gently in a breeze. Standing among the healthy crops, SOMEONE<Norman> plucks a grain from one of the wispy stalks. He bites a seed, examines it and casts a hopeful gaze toward the sunny sky. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS31
00:08:43,00 --> 00:08:50,50
He strolls happily through the barley. Reaching a light blue tractor, he climbs into 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS32
00:09:07,00 --> 00:09:12,50
He goes to prop an elbow on his knee, but slips. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS33
00:09:21,00 --> 00:09:26,50
SOMEONE<Phil> rests an arm on the tractor hood. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS34
00:09:25,00 --> 00:09:30,50
SOMEONE<Norman> reaches for the ignition. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS35
00:09:28,00 --> 00:09:33,50
SOMEONE<Phil> jumps, then waves the boy onward. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS36
00:09:37,00 --> 00:09:40,50
As his nephew drives the trucktor down the path. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS37
00:09:39,00 --> 00:09:44,50
SOMEONE<Phil> turns away with a calculating gaze. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS38
00:09:56,00 --> 00:10:01,50
He marches into the barley field. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS39
00:09:59,00 --> 00:10:03,50
His limousine passes. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS40
00:10:02,00 --> 00:10:08,50
SOMEONE<Norman> hauls a bucket through the muddy work yard. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS41
00:10:10,00 --> 00:10:16,50
The limousine drives past the yard. The three siblings stare. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS42
00:10:22,00 --> 00:10:29,50
In unison, the three dash toward the arriving car, short-cutting through the barn. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS43
00:10:36,00 --> 00:10:46,50
Now, one of the chauffeur's polished leather shoes steps from the limousine, but halts mid-stride above the mud. He gives in and steps down. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS44
00:10:45,00 --> 00:10:49,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> lowers a newspaper. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS45
00:10:49,00 --> 00:10:53,50
SOMEONE<Blenkinsop> opens his door. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS46
00:11:06,00 --> 00:11:11,50
SOMEONE<Vincent> makes a wild face at her. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS47
00:11:21,00 --> 00:11:27,50
In yellow checked knickerbockers, SOMEONE<Cyril> leans foppishly on the car. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS48
00:11:38,00 --> 00:11:43,50
He produces a candy bar. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS49
00:11:49,00 --> 00:11:54,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> eats the last bite and tosses the wrapper at him. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS50
00:12:35,00 --> 00:12:39,50
It's boutique boxes. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS51
00:12:50,00 --> 00:12:54,50
SOMEONE<Norman> chases him. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS52
00:13:06,00 --> 00:13:11,50
SOMEONE<Celia> halts at one of the muddy boxes. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS53
00:13:16,00 --> 00:13:21,50
He runs after the others. Now at the shop. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS54
00:13:42,00 --> 00:13:46,50
The old woman licks her fingers. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS55
00:13:45,00 --> 00:13:50,50
She walks away from an apothecary cabinet. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS56
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:18,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Docherty> enters an adjoining room and shuts the door behind her. Stepping behind the counter, SOMEONE<Isabel> finds syrup dripping from the cabinet drawers, pooling on the floor. Her handbag and green overcoat drop from her grip, landing in the mess. A higher drawer slides open, leaking more syrup. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS57
00:14:18,00 --> 00:14:25,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> lifts a foot. Gooey syrup trails stringily from her shoe. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS58
00:14:31,00 --> 00:14:35,50
She checks the drawers. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS59
00:14:37,00 --> 00:14:42,50
sloshes on her hands. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS60
00:14:58,00 --> 00:15:07,50
She slams it shut. From the counter, the SOMEONE<jackdaw> watches her as she wearily peeks in another. A third opens high above her. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS61
00:15:14,00 --> 00:15:20,50
her way to a shelf where a teapot's lid opens like a mouth. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS62
00:15:20,00 --> 00:15:24,50
Tin canisters tip their lids. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS64
00:15:37,00 --> 00:15:42,50
The phone lunges on an accordion wall bracket. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS65
00:15:47,00 --> 00:15:52,50
Now, SOMEONE<Cyril> enters the farmhouse. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS66
00:15:58,00 --> 00:16:03,50
He enters a pantry. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS67
00:16:01,00 --> 00:16:07,50
He exits with a jar marked Dad's Jam. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS68
00:16:10,00 --> 00:16:17,50
SOMEONE<Norman> glares. With a sneer, SOMEONE<Cyril> strolls to the table. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS69
00:16:24,00 --> 00:16:28,50
He opens it. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS70
00:16:46,00 --> 00:16:50,50
The jar falls over the edge. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS71
00:16:50,00 --> 00:16:55,50
The Greens watch with wide eyes. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS72
00:16:54,00 --> 00:16:59,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> gawks at SOMEONE<Norman>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS73
00:16:57,00 --> 00:17:02,50
SOMEONE<Norman> faces him and SOMEONE<Cyril> bolts. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS74
00:17:06,00 --> 00:17:10,50
Nighttime. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS75
00:17:08,00 --> 00:17:13,50
swirl leaves around SOMEONE<Isabel> as she heads home. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS77
00:17:31,00 --> 00:17:37,50
makes a mechanical wood carved man pump up and down. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS78
00:17:38,00 --> 00:17:42,50
SOMEONE picks a leaf from her 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS80
00:17:48,00 --> 00:17:52,50
Spinning SOMEONE<Isabel> as they run by. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS81
00:17:53,00 --> 00:17:57,50
SOMEONE<Norman> headlocks SOMEONE<Cyril>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS82
00:17:56,00 --> 00:18:00,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> extends a hand. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS83
00:18:18,00 --> 00:18:22,50
above the house lightening flashes. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS86
00:18:39,00 --> 00:18:44,50
turning his head with the contract papers. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS87
00:18:47,00 --> 00:18:51,50
She shuts the door. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS88
00:19:06,00 --> 00:19:10,50
She has one beauty-spot on her chin and one on her upper lip. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS89
00:20:06,00 --> 00:20:11,50
She shuts the parlor door. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS90
00:20:19,00 --> 00:20:23,50
SOMEONE<Nanny> SOMEONE<McPhee> steps inside. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS91
00:20:23,00 --> 00:20:31,50
The SOMEONE<jackdaw> slips in just as the door shuts. The SOMEONE<nanny> regards SOMEONE<Isabel> frankly. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS93
00:21:29,00 --> 00:21:35,50
The SOMEONE retreats under SOMEONE's skirt as the 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS95
00:21:43,00 --> 00:21:54,50
Golden sparks burst from it. Outside. More radiate outward from the house and dissipate. In the parlor, the kids freeze. SOMEONE<Cyril> smirks. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS98
00:23:52,00 --> 00:23:59,50
with her stick. Everything freezes. The bundled letters hovers safely over the flames. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS99
00:23:59,00 --> 00:24:03,50
The SOMEONE<jackdaw> emerges. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS100
00:24:04,00 --> 00:24:07,50
fireplace and grabs the letters. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS101
00:24:07,00 --> 00:24:12,50
With the bundle in his talons, Mr. Edelweiss swoops 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS102
00:24:10,00 --> 00:24:15,50
the kids who remain frozen in time. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS103
00:24:15,00 --> 00:24:26,50
past SOMEONE<Celia> pinching her own nose and SOMEONE<Cyril> yanking his own tie. With her head tilted, SOMEONE<Nanny> SOMEONE<McPhee> watches as the bird hovers over an end table. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS104
00:24:29,00 --> 00:24:33,50
taps the letters. The bird lights on her shoulder. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS105
00:24:36,00 --> 00:24:41,50
The bird moves to the floor in front of her. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS106
00:24:47,00 --> 00:24:53,50
Hanging his head, the bird trudges away. SOMEONE<Nanny> SOMEONE<McPhee> squints and

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS107
00:24:52,00 --> 00:24:59,50
taps her stick. Sparks spray from it and the kids unfreeze. They stare at SOMEONE<Nanny>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS108
00:25:00,00 --> 00:25:07,50
As she eyes them firmly, the parlor door opens behind her. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS109
00:25:07,00 --> 00:25:18,50
She steps aside. As SOMEONE<Norman> and his sister rise from the floor, SOMEONE<Cyril> straightens his tie. The kids file out of the parlor past SOMEONE<Nanny>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS110
00:25:18,00 --> 00:25:23,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> blinks disbelievingly at the well-behaved group. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS111
00:25:24,00 --> 00:25:29,50
She watches as they head upstairs. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS112
00:25:27,00 --> 00:25:31,50
In the parlor. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS113
00:25:32,00 --> 00:25:42,50
She hands him the letters. Glancing at her, he smiles faintly, then turns back to face the room. He finds the elegant dishware unbroken on the table. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS114
00:25:41,00 --> 00:25:50,50
The candy dish sits by, perfectly intact. The unharmed tractor drawing rests on a shelf. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS115
00:25:48,00 --> 00:26:02,50
SOMEONE<Vincent> shifts his gaze to a bench seat against a wall. Toting the cricket bat, he heads over and places the letters on the sill above the seat back. His eyes take in SOMEONE as he walks back to her. He hands her the bat. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS116
00:26:09,00 --> 00:26:16,50
As SOMEONE leaves the parlor, the mole above SOMEONE's upper lip disappears. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS117
00:26:16,00 --> 00:26:21,50
She eyes Mr. Edelweiss. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS118
00:26:24,00 --> 00:26:28,50
She looks at a window which opened. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS119
00:26:27,00 --> 00:26:35,50
As she strides out of the room, Mr. Edelweiss obeys. Now, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE in the kitchen. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS120
00:26:44,00 --> 00:26:49,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> tilts her head. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS121
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:52,50
She leans the bat on the stair rail. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS122
00:27:03,00 --> 00:27:09,50
In a disheveled attic bedroom, a miniature carousel spins. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS123
00:27:07,00 --> 00:27:15,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE cower as SOMEONE enters. SOMEONE<Norman> and his sister scoot back on their beds. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS124
00:28:34,00 --> 00:28:48,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> stares stoically, her snaggletooth pressing into her lower lip. She produces her walking stick from inside her frock and raises it. In the kitchen, SOMEONE<Isabel> sets a teakettle on the stove. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS126
00:28:53,00 --> 00:28:57,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> rubs her eyes. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS127
00:28:56,00 --> 00:29:18,50
At a second look, she finds the staircase as plain as ever. She collects a teapot from the kitchen table and turns her attention to the sink. The front door behind her opens and a goat steps inside. With her back to the animal, SOMEONE<Isabel> washes dishes. As the goat creeps to the stairs, SOMEONE<Isabel> sniffs the air. So does the goat. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS128
00:29:20,00 --> 00:29:42,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> resumes her work. The goat hurries upstairs. It disappears around the corner just as SOMEONE<Isabel> turns. She sets the now clean teapot on the table, then turns her back to the door again and smooths a clock at a sideboard. As she arranges a setting on a tray, a cow enters the house. Geraldine glances at the oblivious woman, then hooves her way upstairs. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS129
00:29:59,00 --> 00:30:04,50
to the sink, a baby elephant enters the house. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS130
00:30:06,00 --> 00:30:11,50
She shields the elephant from SOMEONE<Isabel>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS131
00:30:13,00 --> 00:30:17,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> turns. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS132
00:30:30,00 --> 00:30:35,50
The elephant nudges SOMEONE with its trunk. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS133
00:30:33,00 --> 00:30:41,50
As SOMEONE turns away, SOMEONE directs the elephant up the stairs with a friendly pat on its rear. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS134
00:30:45,00 --> 00:30:50,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> starts for the door. SOMEONE<Isabel> emerges from the pantry. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS135
00:31:06,00 --> 00:31:12,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> beams. SOMEONE<McPhee> produces a lantern. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS136
00:31:14,00 --> 00:31:18,50
The door shuts. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS138
00:31:32,00 --> 00:31:37,50
The SOMEONE gazes at the children's window. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS139
00:31:42,00 --> 00:31:48,50
The dark hairy mole on SOMEONE's chin vanishes. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS140
00:31:52,00 --> 00:31:58,50
SOMEONE<Phil> skulks past a gatepost and nearly bumps into her. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS141
00:32:10,00 --> 00:32:16,50
She brushes past him and strolls off with her lantern. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS142
00:32:15,00 --> 00:32:41,50
SOMEONE's<Phil's> gaze darts. He hunches low and sneaks onto the farm proper toting a shovel. The saboteur freezes warily then trots on. Now curtains drawn over the children's bedroom window flutter. We glide through them and inside. At the foot of the nearest bed, a carousel night light glows softly. A lamp at the head of the bed illuminates the girls sleeping toe-to-toe under the covers next to Geraldine who snores. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS143
00:32:43,00 --> 00:32:49,50
In the next bed over, the goat sleeps with his head on a pillow next to 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS144
00:32:47,00 --> 00:33:00,50
SOMEONE's<Cyril's> slumbering face and SOMEONE<Norman> sleeps with his head at the foot of the bed. Like the girls and cow, all three share a single blanket. Across the room, SOMEONE<Vincent> sleeps by the baby elephant. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS145
00:33:00,00 --> 00:33:19,50
SOMEONE's<Ellie's> trunk steals SOMEONE's<Vincent's> half of the covers. The chilly boy curls up. Now framed photos show SOMEONE<Isabel> and Rory on their wedding day and Rory playing cricket. In bed, SOMEONE<Isabel> reads a worn letter, then sniffs a dried flower folded inside. She presses the letter to her lips. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS146
00:33:21,00 --> 00:33:26,50
Outside, by the side of the barn he digs a hole. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS147
00:33:27,00 --> 00:33:33,50
leans against the barn, then glances back at the house. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS148
00:33:32,00 --> 00:33:41,50
and sticks his head into the hole. He braces himself with both arms as he walks his legs up the side of the barn and eases deeper inside. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS149
00:33:54,00 --> 00:34:00,50
Outside, SOMEONE gets stuck up to his chest.  

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS150
00:33:58,00 --> 00:34:04,50
His feet flail in the air, they flop over and he pulls himself out. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS151
00:34:02,00 --> 00:34:07,50
As he stands to walk away, one of his feet slips into the hole and he falls flat. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS152
00:34:05,00 --> 00:34:09,50
He scrambles up. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS153
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:18,50
He glances at the house as another pig follows. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS154
00:34:19,00 --> 00:34:33,50
Another piglet trots off. Daytime. A rooster perches on the hood of the tractor. Now in the children's room, SOMEONE's shadow passes over their sleeping forms. The animals are gone. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS155
00:34:47,00 --> 00:34:53,50
As she leaves, SOMEONE<Vincent> peeks under his covers. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS157
00:35:36,00 --> 00:35:54,50
The children join them. SOMEONE<Cyril> marches downstairs in purple pajamas and a full-face gas mask with a single snout-like filter. He eyes SOMEONE suspiciously as she cooks, then strides to a seat at the head of the table. SOMEONE<Isabel> stares at his headgear and cocks her head. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS158
00:36:10,00 --> 00:36:14,50
SOMEONE<Nanny> serves breakfast. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS159
00:36:23,00 --> 00:36:33,50
SOMEONE<Celia> hurries into SOMEONE's<Isabel's> room and opens the wardrobe. She rifles through floral sundresses hanging inside. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS161
00:36:38,00 --> 00:36:42,50
Back in the kitchen. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS162
00:36:51,00 --> 00:36:55,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> rushes out. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS163
00:36:59,00 --> 00:37:04,50
The pane falls inward and shatters. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS164
00:37:03,00 --> 00:37:09,50
Later, he flies to a fence and burps. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS165
00:37:17,00 --> 00:37:24,50
He soars into the barn. SOMEONE<McPhee> knits her brow and follows him inside. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS166
00:37:24,00 --> 00:37:29,50
She peeks into the hole. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS167
00:37:34,00 --> 00:37:39,50
Now inside, SOMEONE<Megsie> repairs the window. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS168
00:37:38,00 --> 00:37:43,50
She smooths putty at the seam. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS169
00:38:01,00 --> 00:38:07,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> mouths Ew, affecting a mock fearful expression. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS170
00:38:05,00 --> 00:38:13,50
SOMEONE<Celia> descends the stairs in a flowing white gown of layered tulle. She wears a silky veil. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS171
00:38:17,00 --> 00:38:24,50
She studies the dress. Outside, SOMEONE<Norman> carries a bucket into the barn. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS172
00:38:21,00 --> 00:38:28,50
He finds the pigpen empty. In the kitchen. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS173
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:24,50
She lifts her brow and raises her stick, then leans it gently against the table. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS174
00:39:38,00 --> 00:39:43,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> blinks thoughtfully, then doffs his mask. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS175
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:56,50
He storms out after his cousins. SOMEONE<Celia> lingers on the staircase landing. SOMEONE<McPhee> summons a breath, picks up her gnarled walking stick, and faces the girl. The SOMEONE<nanny> looks from the open door to SOMEONE<Celia>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS176
00:39:58,00 --> 00:40:03,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> steps closer. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS178
00:40:11,00 --> 00:40:15,50
pair of rubber boots. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS179
00:40:14,00 --> 00:40:21,50
Now SOMEONE<Norman> stands on a hilltop. SOMEONE<Cyril> hobbles toward him, panting. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS180
00:40:19,00 --> 00:40:23,50
A piglet flees. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS181
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:31,50
find some pigs. She dives for them. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS182
00:40:46,00 --> 00:40:50,50
nearby piglet races for a tree. SOMEONE<Norman> chases him. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS183
00:40:51,00 --> 00:40:55,50
at the base of a tree. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS184
00:40:57,00 --> 00:41:01,50
Back at the farm. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS185
00:41:11,00 --> 00:41:20,50
She bangs her walking stick on the ground, creating sparks. At the tree, the piglet runs up the trunk. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS186
00:41:19,00 --> 00:41:25,50
Boys gape. It bounced to a branch high over their heads. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS187
00:41:24,00 --> 00:41:31,50
The piglet performs a flip, somersaults through midair, then lands easily back on the branch. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS188
00:41:32,00 --> 00:41:40,50
It smiles at them. The boys swap looks. One hoof slips off, bouncing the branch. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS190
00:41:46,00 --> 00:41:50,50
and lands on another tree branch. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS191
00:41:51,00 --> 00:41:56,50
The boys give chase. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS192
00:41:58,00 --> 00:42:02,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> bangs her stick again. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS194
00:42:12,00 --> 00:42:17,50
and dives gracefully into the water. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS195
00:42:16,00 --> 00:42:21,50
Blinks quizzically. The pig surfaces and swims 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS196
00:42:19,00 --> 00:42:26,50
then faces them. It pinches its snout with a hoof and takes a breath. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS197
00:42:28,00 --> 00:42:34,50
pokes its rear into view and playfully flexes its legs to the sky. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS198
00:42:37,00 --> 00:42:40,50
poking their heads up they circle 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS199
00:42:40,00 --> 00:42:44,50
They lie on their sides and then roll and place making a turning shapes. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS203
00:43:02,00 --> 00:43:06,50
The six pig hold it in his hooves. The five others fling the flower, the pig into the air. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS204
00:43:04,00 --> 00:43:09,50
Splashing the water, 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS205
00:43:09,00 --> 00:43:13,50
by the children, the pigs swims in circle, 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS206
00:43:12,00 --> 00:43:16,50
then glide away in a queue. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS207
00:43:18,00 --> 00:43:22,50
The first pig does a backstroke. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS208
00:43:20,00 --> 00:43:27,50
Now on a road, SOMEONE<Phil> haps upon a man driving a horse drawn cart. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS209
00:43:28,00 --> 00:43:32,50
He hustles along as the farmer halts. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS210
00:43:33,00 --> 00:43:38,50
The saboteur thoughtfully slows to a stop. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS211
00:44:10,00 --> 00:44:16,50
SOMEONE<Phil> shifts his gaze and hustles off down the road. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS212
00:44:31,00 --> 00:44:38,50
hops to the cart. Now all five children meet on a hilltop. The pigs race away through a meadow. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS213
00:44:56,00 --> 00:45:06,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> draws in the dirt. Later, apples lie on a wooded road. SOMEONE<Cyril> and SOMEONE<Norman> sit astride a branch above, holding SOMEONE's<Isabel's> veil. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS214
00:45:06,00 --> 00:45:13,50
The girls perch high on the road shoulder. SOMEONE<Norman> cups his hands. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS215
00:45:14,00 --> 00:45:27,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> and SOMEONE<Norman> hold the veil between them. Under the branch, the piglets barrel down the road toward them. SOMEONE<Vincent> runs after them, driving them along, holding his safari hat in place with one hand. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS216
00:45:27,00 --> 00:45:32,50
The steep embankments on either side of the road help 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS217
00:45:34,00 --> 00:45:38,50
the animals gallop by. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS219
00:45:39,00 --> 00:45:46,50
Together Mouth three, two, one and drop the veil like a net. Now, in the barn. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS220
00:46:17,00 --> 00:46:23,50
SOMEONE<Phil> gives a smarmy wave good-bye. SOMEONE<Isabel> sinks down. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS221
00:46:34,00 --> 00:46:44,50
Outside, the five children return with the piglets. SOMEONE<Isabel> dashes through the barn, SOMEONE<Phil> trailing closely behind. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS222
00:46:43,00 --> 00:46:49,50
He stares wide-eyed. SOMEONE<Norman> and SOMEONE<Cyril> carry a few

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS223
00:46:49,00 --> 00:46:54,50
Smiling, Farmer SOMEONE opens the cart. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS224
00:46:57,00 --> 00:47:01,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> joins the children at the cart. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS225
00:47:16,00 --> 00:47:21,50
SOMEONE<Phil> glances at the contract. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS227
00:47:21,00 --> 00:47:28,50
He jerks his feet lose from the deep doubles through the barn and dashes out of sight. SOMEONE<Cyril> scowls at the money. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS228
00:47:52,00 --> 00:47:57,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> joyfully kisses his cheek. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS229
00:48:14,00 --> 00:48:18,50
notices SOMEONE looking on. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS230
00:48:18,00 --> 00:48:24,50
The others turn. The mysterious woman tilts her head. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS231
00:48:25,00 --> 00:48:31,50
Farmer SOMEONE<Macreadie> shuts the cart and eyes a piglet. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS232
00:48:32,00 --> 00:48:36,50
gathers the children in her arms. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS233
00:48:38,00 --> 00:48:43,50
Noticing SOMEONE<Celia>, she straightens and frowns. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS234
00:48:53,00 --> 00:48:59,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> stares at the girl with a furrowed brow. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS235
00:49:08,00 --> 00:49:14,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> returns the torn filthy veil wadded up in a ball. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS236
00:49:13,00 --> 00:49:19,50
As SOMEONE<Isabel> stares at it, SOMEONE<Megsie> remorsefully hangs her head. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS237
00:49:35,00 --> 00:49:40,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> observes. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS238
00:49:42,00 --> 00:49:58,50
Her unibrow vanishes. She catches a piglet watching her. SOMEONE<McPhee> winks and the animal winks back. She puts a shushing finger to her lips and the piglet joins its siblings. Farmer SOMEONE<Macreadie> watches with a puzzled frown. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS239
00:50:00,00 --> 00:50:06,50
As the cart leaves, two piglets peer over the back gate. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS240
00:50:09,00 --> 00:50:14,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> tilts her head. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS241
00:50:12,00 --> 00:50:19,50
SOMEONE<Celia> turns. The limousine approaches. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS242
00:50:26,00 --> 00:50:39,50
Running to the car, she opens the passenger door and finds the backseat empty. SOMEONE<Celia> shuts the door with a wounded gaze. SOMEONE<Cyril> looks on sympathetically as his sister faces SOMEONE<Blenkinsop>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS243
00:50:41,00 --> 00:50:46,50
Her brother glances toward their cousins. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS244
00:50:49,00 --> 00:50:54,50
The chauffeur meets her gaze. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS245
00:51:00,00 --> 00:51:10,50
SOMEONE<Blenkinsop> holds out a shoebox of SOMEONE's<robin's> egg blue marked with a scallop-shell logo. SOMEONE<Celia> slowly takes it from him. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS246
00:51:14,00 --> 00:51:22,50
Under SOMEONE's<Blenkinsop's> compassionate gaze, SOMEONE<Celia> hangs her head then steps away. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS247
00:51:20,00 --> 00:51:25,50
The chauffeur sadly faces forward. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS248
00:51:23,00 --> 00:51:31,50
The city girl marches out through the farm gate, biting her rosy lips in a suppressed sob. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS249
00:51:36,00 --> 00:51:55,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> follows his sister. Heading into a lush green field, SOMEONE<Celia> chucks the shoebox to the ground. SOMEONE<Norman> and SOMEONE<Megsie> stare after their unhappy cousins, then turn away and head toward the barn. SOMEONE<McPhee> observes the children, then shifts her thoughtful gaze. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS250
00:51:56,00 --> 00:52:10,50
Above, clouds drift across a violet sky. Later, SOMEONE<Celia> sits dejectedly on the edge of SOMEONE's<Megsie's> bed. The farm girl enters with the shoebox and sets it down beside her cousin. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS251
00:52:13,00 --> 00:52:33,50
SOMEONE<Celia> shrugs. Sitting by her, SOMEONE<Megsie> puts the box on her own lap. She admiringly sets the lid aside, reaches into the rosy tissue paper, and pulls out a graceful pale pink slipper. It bears an ankle strap at the back and a pale pink bow and rhinestone buckle on the closed toe. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS252
00:52:33,00 --> 00:52:52,50
The farm girl faces her cousin and finds her expression sincere. She puts the shoe back in the box, sets it aside, and goes to a trunk at the foot of her bed. SOMEONE<Celia> cranes her neck to watch. SOMEONE<Megsie> pulls out some brown velveteen pants and a crisp white blouse, both neatly folded. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS253
00:52:54,00 --> 00:54:08,50
She lays them beside SOMEONE<Celia>, then sits and returns the shoebox to her lap. With a faint smile, the city girl picks up the dainty blouse which bears small blue toned polka dots. She holds it to her chest and smiles. SOMEONE<Celia> lays it aside and regards the velveteen. Our view dips to a pair of hands scrubbing filthy fabric. At a bathtub, SOMEONE<Isabel> massages lather into her wedding veil, bites her lips, then checks the rinsed cloth. It bears a one-inch hole. In a gold-tinged flashback, a modest carriage stands adorned with sunflowers, roses, and a Just Married sign. In the driver's seat, a handsome man in a black jacket and a boutonniere made of barley sprigs beams at his bride, SOMEONE<Isabel>. A wreath of flowers holds her snowy veil upon her head. As we glimpse SOMEONE<Isabel> eyeing the ruined veil, she remembers laughing merrily with her groom. They stand in the mud. He in his boots and she, luxuriantly, dipping in her bare foot. Rory scoops SOMEONE<Isabel> into his arms. They share a loving kiss and he carries her toward the house. She clings to him, holding her shoes and wedding bouquet. Back in the present, SOMEONE<Isabel> hangs the tattered veil on a clothesline. As it flutters in a breeze, our view of its SOMEONE<lacy> trim blurs. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS255
00:54:45,00 --> 00:54:50,50
She eyes the large manure patty 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS256
00:55:06,00 --> 00:55:11,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> wears seven colorful medals. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS257
00:55:16,00 --> 00:55:20,50
He perches on her shoulder. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS258
00:55:50,00 --> 00:55:56,50
The bird covers his beak with his wing. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS259
00:56:21,00 --> 00:56:25,50
SOMEONE<Docherty> shows an illustration. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS260
00:56:40,00 --> 00:56:45,50
He move his hands like wings and pretends to fly. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS261
00:56:44,00 --> 00:56:48,50
He outlines a bomb with his hands. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS262
00:57:45,00 --> 00:57:49,50
with a hat over her face. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS264
00:58:24,00 --> 00:58:31,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Docherty> gazes sadly as SOMEONE<Phil> hikes toward them. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS265
00:58:29,00 --> 00:58:35,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> glances at the old woman, who swallows hard. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS266
00:58:40,00 --> 00:58:50,50
SOMEONE's<Isabel's> joyful smile fades slightly. Standing apart, SOMEONE steps forward. SOMEONE<Phil> faces SOMEONE<Isabel> and the children. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS267
00:58:50,00 --> 00:59:01,50
He holds the envelope out to his sister-in-law. She accepts it bravely, turns it over in her graceful hands, and musters a smile. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS268
00:59:01,00 --> 00:59:07,50
SOMEONE<Phil> looks away. SOMEONE<Isabel> faces Mrs. SOMEONE<Docherty>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS269
00:59:08,00 --> 00:59:25,50
The old woman nods. As SOMEONE<Isabel> turns away, Mrs. SOMEONE's<Docherty's> brow furrows compassionately. Her lips pressed into a brisk smile, SOMEONE<Isabel> opens the envelope. SOMEONE's<Norman's> chest heaves. As his mother reads the telegram, her smile vanishes. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS270
00:59:24,00 --> 00:59:30,50
She sinks to the ground. SOMEONE<Norman> takes the message. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS271
00:59:28,00 --> 00:59:34,50
SOMEONE<Vincent> sits close to SOMEONE<Isabel> as his older siblings read. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS272
00:59:34,00 --> 00:59:49,50
SOMEONE<Norman> drops his full glass of ginger beer and SOMEONE<Megsie> collapses behind their mother. SOMEONE<McPhee> bows her head. As SOMEONE listlessly steps away, SOMEONE crouches before SOMEONE and the Docherty's draw near. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS273
00:59:48,00 --> 01:00:04,50
The husband reaches for SOMEONE<Isabel>, but his wife tactfully restrains him. SOMEONE<Norman> continues through the field, leaving the others behind. As SOMEONE<Isabel> stares off with heartbroken gaze, SOMEONE<Phil> clutches her hand in both of his. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS274
01:00:02,00 --> 01:00:17,50
Now the sun shines cheerily on the barn. Inside, SOMEONE<Norman> sits slumped on the Scratch-o-matic seat. He takes a ragged breath. Watching him from the doorway, SOMEONE<Cyril> meekly shifts on his feet. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS275
01:00:16,00 --> 01:00:24,50
SOMEONE<Norman> turns to face him. His gaze solemn, SOMEONE<Cyril> steps up alongside him. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS276
01:00:22,00 --> 01:00:28,50
He looks up, admiring the Scratch-o-matic. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS277
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:34,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> faces his cousin. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS278
01:00:48,00 --> 01:00:53,50
SOMEONE<Norman> climbs down from the Scratch-o-matic seat. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS279
01:01:17,00 --> 01:01:22,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> gives a respectful nod. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS280
01:01:20,00 --> 01:01:25,50
Taking a seat, he smiles up at him. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS281
01:02:03,00 --> 01:02:09,50
SOMEONE<Norman> bites his lip and shifts his thoughtful gaze. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS282
01:02:21,00 --> 01:02:25,50
In the barn. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS283
01:02:56,00 --> 01:03:03,50
Grins. They pass a row of red-coated guards who salute SOMEONE<Nanny>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS284
01:03:11,00 --> 01:03:15,50
The children stare. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS285
01:03:30,00 --> 01:03:34,50
An statue coming to life. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS286
01:03:32,00 --> 01:03:38,50
statue bows his head. A lion statue rests at the base 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS287
01:03:37,00 --> 01:03:41,50
Lion statue is coming to life as SOMEONE and the boys smile. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS290
01:04:11,00 --> 01:04:16,50
SOMEONE<Norman> turns a red knob in the sidecar. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS291
01:04:14,00 --> 01:04:19,50
The SOMEONE<nanny> patiently taps her handle bar. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS292
01:04:21,00 --> 01:04:27,50
front tire as the motorcycle levitates. It carries them 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS293
01:04:29,00 --> 01:04:34,50
Now, the motorcycle lands safely 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS294
01:04:41,00 --> 01:04:46,50
Now, Topsey and Turvey join SOMEONE<Phil> on the country road. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS295
01:04:45,00 --> 01:04:50,50
They each grab a shoulder. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS297
01:05:12,00 --> 01:05:19,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> dismounts and waits as SOMEONE<Cyril> and SOMEONE<Norman> climb out of the sidecar. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS298
01:05:21,00 --> 01:05:32,50
Both boys wear suits. SOMEONE's<Norman's> is blue gray and SOMEONE's<Cyril's> is checked with a purple necktie. They eye the towering building, then stride toward it. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS299
01:05:36,00 --> 01:05:45,50
Black boots block their way. The boys sweep their eyes up the red coat of a barrel chested guard in a tall bearskin hat. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS300
01:05:49,00 --> 01:05:54,50
SOMEONE<Norman> mouths, Tell him, to SOMEONE<Cyril>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS301
01:05:56,00 --> 01:06:01,50
SOMEONE's<Cyril's> lips stutter. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS302
01:06:04,00 --> 01:06:09,50
SOMEONE wears a military uniform and 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS303
01:06:07,00 --> 01:06:13,50
Jeffreys spins his rifle, then shoulders it and stands at attention. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS304
01:06:13,00 --> 01:06:18,50
The boys exchange a look. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS305
01:06:16,00 --> 01:06:21,50
She salutes, then heads over. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS306
01:06:25,00 --> 01:06:31,50
Sergeant Jeffreys uneasily shifts his gaze. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS307
01:06:40,00 --> 01:06:46,50
She gives a nod. Sergeant Jeffreys smiles. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS308
01:06:50,00 --> 01:07:21,50
Grinning, the boys follow the sergeant as he marches past sand bag barricades through a doorway. The boys glance back at SOMEONE, garbed once again in her black dress. She knowingly touches the side of her nose. Sergeant Jeffreys leads SOMEONE<Norman> and SOMEONE<Cyril> down a corridor to an elevator where they ride to the 100th floor. On the top floor, they pass military strategists who position model planes, ships, and tanks on a table map as big as eight king size beds. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS309
01:07:20,00 --> 01:07:26,50
Back on the farm. The girls find SOMEONE<Isabel> and SOMEONE<Phil> in the kitchen. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS310
01:07:27,00 --> 01:07:31,50
Leafs through the contract. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS311
01:07:46,00 --> 01:07:54,50
Back at the War Office, SOMEONE<Norman> and SOMEONE<Cyril> walk side by side down a narrow red carpet. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS312
01:07:51,00 --> 01:08:07,50
At the end of a long room, the carpet spreads into a square underneath a wide desk. A mustached man in a military uniform stands behind it. As the boys stop in front of his desk, he stares down at them with stern eyes. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS313
01:08:38,00 --> 01:08:51,50
Lord SOMEONE's<Gray's> eyes widen at SOMEONE<Norman>. He sets his glasses down on his desk, then steps out from behind it. With his arms crossed at his back, he regards the boys frankly. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS314
01:08:51,00 --> 01:08:56,50
SOMEONE<Norman> gives SOMEONE<Cyril> a nod. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS315
01:09:03,00 --> 01:09:08,50
Lord SOMEONE<Gray> listens. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS316
01:09:26,00 --> 01:09:30,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> presses his lips tightly. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS317
01:09:37,00 --> 01:09:42,50
Licking his lips, SOMEONE<Norman> lowers his gaze. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS318
01:10:23,00 --> 01:10:30,50
Lord SOMEONE<Gray> closes the distance between them and glares at SOMEONE<Norman>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS319
01:10:37,00 --> 01:10:43,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> glances at his cousin's anguished face. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS320
01:11:02,00 --> 01:11:08,50
Lord SOMEONE<Gray> stares, his reddened face almost queasy. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS321
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:21,50
SOMEONE<Norman> shifts his gaze from SOMEONE<Cyril> to Lord SOMEONE<Gray>. The man looks into his nephew's unwavering eyes, then opens his mouth to speak. His lips stutter. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS322
01:11:20,00 --> 01:11:25,50
With an embarrassed look, he turns away. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS323
01:11:23,00 --> 01:11:36,50
The boys watch as he walks back behind his desk and straightens his tie. Lord SOMEONE<Gray> stares downward, picks up his glasses, then lifts his gaze thoughtfully to the boys before him. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS324
01:11:37,00 --> 01:11:50,50
As he trudges out of the room, SOMEONE<Norman> rests a hand on SOMEONE's<Cyril's> shoulder. At the farmhouse, SOMEONE<Phil> clutches a pen in his hands as he hovers over SOMEONE<Isabel>, watching her review the contract. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS325
01:11:51,00 --> 01:11:58,50
As he leans over her shoulder, the fountain pen poised, SOMEONE<Isabel> gives him a look. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS326
01:12:07,00 --> 01:12:15,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> yanks the pen from SOMEONE<Phil>, then continues reading. SOMEONE<Celia> steps up onto a chair. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS327
01:12:20,00 --> 01:12:27,50
Glancing at him, SOMEONE<Isabel> stomps to the chair. She kneels and peeks underneath. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS328
01:12:26,00 --> 01:12:31,50
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a puzzled look, but 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS329
01:12:31,00 --> 01:12:37,50
SOMEONE<Megsie> grabs it and stows it in her tool belt. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS330
01:12:36,00 --> 01:12:40,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> leans against a wall. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS331
01:12:40,00 --> 01:12:46,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> nods sadly. He swallows hard. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS332
01:12:58,00 --> 01:13:02,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> hangs his head. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS333
01:13:08,00 --> 01:13:20,50
The boys look to the door where an officer enters with Lord SOMEONE<Gray>. The officer gathers a long strip of ticker tape as it trails behind him. Lord SOMEONE<Gray> faces SOMEONE<Norman>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS334
01:13:34,00 --> 01:13:40,50
SOMEONE<Norman> averts his heartbroken gaze, then furrows his brow. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS335
01:13:57,00 --> 01:14:01,50
It's Lord SOMEONE<Gray>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS336
01:14:05,00 --> 01:14:11,50
SOMEONE<Norman> releases him, then turns to SOMEONE<Cyril>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS337
01:14:11,00 --> 01:14:15,50
They start to run. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS338
01:14:13,00 --> 01:14:26,50
The boys stop by the door. With a tender look, Lord SOMEONE<Gray> strides down the narrow red carpet, his eyes on his son. He faces SOMEONE<Cyril> and takes a breath. The boy holds his father's gaze. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS339
01:14:29,00 --> 01:14:38,50
Cyril's lips purse into an uncertain smirk. His father flashes a hint of a smile, then nods. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS340
01:14:44,00 --> 01:14:49,50
Lord SOMEONE<Gray> allows his smile through. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS341
01:14:48,00 --> 01:14:52,50
He shakes SOMEONE's<Cyril's> hand. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS342
01:14:50,00 --> 01:15:01,50
With a nod, SOMEONE<Cyril> releases his father's hand and turns away. Lord SOMEONE<Gray> watches the boy shoot him a final glance, then exit the room. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS343
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:05,50
Now SOMEONE<Cyril> and SOMEONE<Norman> hurry through the War Office building. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS344
01:15:21,00 --> 01:15:25,50
is the SOMEONE<Nanny>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS345
01:15:31,00 --> 01:15:35,50
the sidecar. SOMEONE<is>

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS346
01:15:35,00 --> 01:15:39,50
hits the ground under the chair with the small 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS347
01:15:50,00 --> 01:15:54,50
comes off the counter 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS348
01:15:53,00 --> 01:16:00,50
SOMEONE<Celia> climbs down from the chair. SOMEONE<Phil> glances around. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS349
01:16:02,00 --> 01:16:12,50
He frowns as he notices the table and the contracts, but no pen. Lifting the papers, he searches underneath, then pats his pockets. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS350
01:16:11,00 --> 01:16:18,50
He scratches behind his ears, then tilts his head as if shaking out water. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS351
01:16:22,00 --> 01:16:26,50
just through a drawer, tossing items 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS352
01:16:24,00 --> 01:16:28,50
onto the next one. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS353
01:16:27,00 --> 01:16:34,50
He knocks a piece to the floor. The girls share a glance as SOMEONE<Phil> tears apart

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS354
01:16:33,00 --> 01:16:38,50
inside a box, then turns to them with three pens. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS355
01:16:38,00 --> 01:16:45,50
He smiles triumphantly. SOMEONE<Megsie> storms onto the stairs and peers upward. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS356
01:16:49,00 --> 01:16:53,50
Peel lifts from SOMEONE's face 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS357
01:16:58,00 --> 01:17:02,50
at the sky as she drives SOMEONE and SOMEONE 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS358
01:17:08,00 --> 01:17:13,50
SOMEONE<Norman> lifts the walking stick from the sidecar. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS359
01:17:16,00 --> 01:17:22,50
SOMEONE<Norman> looks nervously at SOMEONE<Cyril>. He eyes the road. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS360
01:17:26,00 --> 01:17:31,50
SOMEONE<Norman> bangs the stick. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS361
01:17:31,00 --> 01:17:35,50
SOMEONE<Cyril> looks over. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS362
01:17:39,00 --> 01:17:51,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> rolls her eyes. Back at the farm, SOMEONE<Vincent> sits alone in the barn and watches some chickens. The baby elephant appears behind him and taps him with its trunk. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS363
01:17:50,00 --> 01:17:56,50
The elephant curls its trunk, then extends it. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS364
01:17:56,00 --> 01:18:02,50
SOMEONE<Phil> sets two pens beside SOMEONE<Isabel> who holds her head as she reads the papers. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS365
01:18:05,00 --> 01:18:14,50
There's a third pen on the contract for SOMEONE<Isabel>. The elephant's trunk sneaks up from under the table and steals it. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS366
01:18:15,00 --> 01:18:21,50
SOMEONE<Phil> reaches for his pen, but it's gone. He pats the table. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS367
01:18:23,00 --> 01:18:28,50
search under the table, the elephant steals the other two pens. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS369
01:18:30,00 --> 01:18:38,50
SOMEONE<Celia> and SOMEONE<Megsie> stifle their grins as SOMEONE<Phil> searches under the table. They see the elephant leaving. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS370
01:18:37,00 --> 01:18:41,50
SOMEONE<Vincent> sees him off. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS371
01:18:48,00 --> 01:19:01,50
SOMEONE's<Phil's> head rises from behind the tabletop as he straightens and eyes SOMEONE<Megsie>. With a dry look, he brushes his bangs out of his face. Now SOMEONE's motorcycle speeds down the road. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS372
01:19:03,00 --> 01:19:09,50
In the sidecar, SOMEONE<Norman> glances at his wristwatch. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS373
01:19:13,00 --> 01:19:19,50
grins at SOMEONE<Norman>, then leans forward. As the motorcycle 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS374
01:19:21,00 --> 01:19:38,50
on the road, disappearing in a trail of smoke. Back at the house, SOMEONE<Celia> and SOMEONE<Megsie> nervously watch SOMEONE<Phil> as he shuffles over on his knees. He stares eye level to SOMEONE<Megsie>, gawking first at her, then at her tool belt. SOMEONE<Megsie> squeezes her eyes shut. SOMEONE<Phil> plucks out the pen. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS375
01:19:41,00 --> 01:19:48,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> sadly eyes her daughter as SOMEONE<Phil> stands and uncaps the pen. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS376
01:19:48,00 --> 01:19:53,50
SOMEONE<Megsie> holds her gaze. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS377
01:19:55,00 --> 01:20:00,50
He puts the pen in her hand and she pushes him away. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS378
01:19:59,00 --> 01:20:04,50
SOMEONE<Megsie> pulls SOMEONE<Celia> aside. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS379
01:20:05,00 --> 01:20:10,50
They watch with terrified looks. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS380
01:20:09,00 --> 01:20:15,50
Outside, an enemy plane soars in the sky. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS381
01:20:21,00 --> 01:20:26,50
Below, in the house, SOMEONE<Isabel> starts to sign the deed. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS382
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:38,50
As he sneezes, the pilot's head bobs, dropping dangerously close to a red control button. SOMEONE<Isabel> finishes writing her first name. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS383
01:20:38,00 --> 01:20:43,50
The nose hits the button and it lights up. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS384
01:20:43,00 --> 01:20:51,50
SOMEONE's<Isabel's> pen bumps the paper too hard and spills ink on the deed. She and the kids rush to the window. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS385
01:20:49,00 --> 01:20:53,50
bomb in the middle of the barley field. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS386
01:21:19,00 --> 01:21:24,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Docherty> arrives. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS387
01:21:48,00 --> 01:21:54,50
Staring with dazed eyes, SOMEONE<Isabel> sinks into a chair. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS388
01:21:52,00 --> 01:21:56,50
SOMEONE<Megsie> hugs SOMEONE<Celia>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS389
01:22:16,00 --> 01:22:21,50
SOMEONE<Norman> strides over to her. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS390
01:22:20,00 --> 01:22:26,50
He holds his mother's gaze. She nods tearfully. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS391
01:22:35,00 --> 01:22:41,50
She smiles at SOMEONE<Norman>, then rises and embraces him. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS392
01:23:03,00 --> 01:23:07,50
The boys hurry to the window. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS393
01:23:07,00 --> 01:23:11,50
He reads a manual. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS394
01:23:15,00 --> 01:23:19,50
Reading, Mr. SOMEONE<She>

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS395
01:23:23,00 --> 01:23:29,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> and the kids turn from the window and glare at SOMEONE<Phil>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS396
01:23:37,00 --> 01:23:43,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> approaches SOMEONE<Phil>, who wears one cuff on his wrist. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS397
01:23:41,00 --> 01:23:46,50
the unused cuff and locks it around a pot rack bar over 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS398
01:23:46,00 --> 01:23:50,50
She leaves him. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS399
01:23:51,00 --> 01:24:06,50
Now in the barley field, the bomb stands lodged, nose first in the ground. Mr. SOMEONE<Docherty> stands on a ladder over its steaming tail vent. As he refers to his manual, he spots the others on the field's edge. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS400
01:24:08,00 --> 01:24:19,50
Mr. Edelweiss lands atop a quaint Vardo styled wagon. As Mr. SOMEONE<Docherty> peers into the bomb's tail, his eyes widen. He swings backward and the ladder tips. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS401
01:24:25,00 --> 01:24:29,50
SOMEONE<Megsie> races towards the bomb. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS402
01:24:37,00 --> 01:24:42,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> chases the kids. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS403
01:24:41,00 --> 01:24:51,50
In the house without a chair, SOMEONE<Phil> balances on one foot, crosses the other over as if sitting, and props an elbow on his crooked knee. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS404
01:24:49,00 --> 01:24:54,50
He releases the pose. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS405
01:24:52,00 --> 01:24:56,50
He grimaces. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS406
01:24:55,00 --> 01:25:04,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Megsie> stands on the ladder and peers through a circular opening in the bomb that has louvers like a window shutter. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS407
01:25:14,00 --> 01:25:21,50
SOMEONE<Megsie> removes the circular vent. She tosses it. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS408
01:25:25,00 --> 01:25:38,50
SOMEONE<Megsie> removes a pair of scissors from her tool belt. Peering into the vent, she tries to work the scissor blades past the protective metal spiral coiled around the wire. They won't fit. The others watch nervously. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS409
01:25:43,00 --> 01:25:49,50
As everyone searches their pockets, SOMEONE's<Celia's> face lights up. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS410
01:25:47,00 --> 01:25:54,50
She takes out a manicure case and removes a pair of nail scissors. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS411
01:25:54,00 --> 01:26:03,50
She hands them to SOMEONE<Cyril>, who grins, then passes them up the ladder to SOMEONE<Norman>. SOMEONE<Megsie> receives the scissors and inspects them. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS412
01:26:05,00 --> 01:26:15,50
SOMEONE<Celia> gives a relieved nod. SOMEONE<Megsie> reaches through the bomb's vent and works the scissors between two of the coils. She snips the wire. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS413
01:26:22,00 --> 01:26:34,50
He frees up a hand and grabs a shaker off the table to season his eggs. He dips a finger in for a taste, then moves a pan onto a burner and pours the eggs in. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS414
01:26:36,00 --> 01:26:41,50
Miss SOMEONE<Topsey> and Miss SOMEONE<Turvey> stand behind him. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS415
01:26:39,00 --> 01:26:46,50
They wear candy striper uniforms. Outside by the bomb. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS416
01:26:47,00 --> 01:26:57,50
SOMEONE<Megsie> leans into the bomb, her arms stretching toward the wire. The tip of her scissors stop a few inches away. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS417
01:26:59,00 --> 01:27:08,50
She keeps trying. As SOMEONE<Celia> bites a knuckle, SOMEONE<Cyril> waits anxiously. Mrs. SOMEONE<Docherty> startles them. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS418
01:27:12,00 --> 01:27:27,50
She glances at SOMEONE<Nanny>. The kids return their attention to SOMEONE<Megsie>, who leans down into the vent and stretches her arms toward the red wire. Her scissor blades close around it and she snips through. She straightens and looks at the others. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS419
01:28:08,00 --> 01:28:14,50
A large blonde woman shows a stuffed and mounted owl. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS420
01:28:18,00 --> 01:28:23,50
She has a doll sized replica of SOMEONE<Phil>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS422
01:29:27,00 --> 01:29:32,50
around the wire revealing a green loop.  

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS423
01:29:33,00 --> 01:29:38,50
She hits the wire. The countdown stops. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS424
01:29:36,00 --> 01:29:40,50
The red bulbs close up. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS426
01:29:56,00 --> 01:30:02,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> lifts her brow and nods proudly. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS427
01:30:00,00 --> 01:30:05,50
And SOMEONE<Celia> turns to him. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS429
01:30:11,00 --> 01:30:16,50
who descends the ladder. As SOMEONE<Megsie> reaches the bottom,

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS430
01:30:14,00 --> 01:30:18,50
they share a big group hug. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS431
01:30:23,00 --> 01:30:29,50
She smiles at the loving group. SOMEONE<Megsie> points to the sky

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS432
01:30:34,00 --> 01:30:39,50
at the body expanding like a balloon. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS433
01:30:37,00 --> 01:30:41,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> eyes him. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS434
01:30:40,00 --> 01:30:44,50
She lifts her chin. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS435
01:30:43,00 --> 01:30:47,50
The others flee. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS436
01:30:49,00 --> 01:30:57,50
SOMEONE<Topsey> and SOMEONE<Turvey> pull an IV bottle of pink fluid from their medical bag. SOMEONE<Phil> jerks against his handcuffs. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS437
01:30:56,00 --> 01:31:13,50
Inside, the boys and SOMEONE<Isabel> peek out from behind the wagon, as Mr. Edelweiss, now enormously round like a balloon, descend to SOMEONE<Nanny>. The girls take cover behind a trough with Mr. SOMEONE<Docherty>. SOMEONE<McPhee> catches the bird, points him in a new direction, and releases him. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS438
01:31:13,00 --> 01:31:24,50
He floats high, flapping his wings which appear puny compared to his inflated body. SOMEONE<Isabel> watches with an awestruck gaze. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS439
01:31:21,00 --> 01:31:27,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> raises her walking stick. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS440
01:31:40,00 --> 01:31:45,50
In the kitchen. The windows burst open. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS441
01:31:50,00 --> 01:31:54,50
She seizes a banister. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS443
01:32:17,00 --> 01:32:21,50
The door swings shut. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS444
01:32:19,00 --> 01:32:26,50
As the wind dies down, SOMEONE<Phil> descends safely to the floor. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS445
01:32:30,00 --> 01:32:34,50
He sits on the stove. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS446
01:32:35,00 --> 01:32:41,50
Magical wind mows a curving path through the barley. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS448
01:33:07,00 --> 01:33:15,50
sparkling golden light. Next, the whirlwind transforms into a cloud of green above SOMEONE<Nanny>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS449
01:33:19,00 --> 01:33:25,50
The baby elephant with the bird perched on its back.  

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS450
01:33:25,00 --> 01:33:31,50
Next, a fish, then a dolphin undulating through an unseen current. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS452
01:33:44,00 --> 01:33:50,50
in a circle, moving up and down like carousel horses. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS454
01:34:04,00 --> 01:34:10,50
Snowflakes. The children hold up their hands and Mrs. SOMEONE<Docherty> tried

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS455
01:34:08,00 --> 01:34:13,50
catching some in her open handbag. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS456
01:34:11,00 --> 01:34:19,50
Turning on the spot, SOMEONE<Vincent> stops, facing the field and stares. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS457
01:34:19,00 --> 01:34:25,50
The SOMEONE's<Docherty’s> follow his gaze. Their mouths agape. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS458
01:34:24,00 --> 01:34:33,50
Our view sweeps out to the field where SOMEONE stands among a vast and tidy arrangement of the baled and bundled crops. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS459
01:34:41,00 --> 01:34:45,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> returns. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS460
01:34:51,00 --> 01:34:56,50
The slide leans on a hay bale. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS461
01:34:57,00 --> 01:35:05,50
Smiling, SOMEONE<Isabel> follows the others out to the slide. Mrs. SOMEONE<Docherty> lags behind with a bittersweet gaze. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS462
01:35:05,00 --> 01:35:09,50
SOMEONE<Norman> slides down the tin chute. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS463
01:35:07,00 --> 01:35:12,50
SOMEONE<Megsie> takes the next turn, followed by Mr. SOMEONE<Docherty>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS464
01:35:11,00 --> 01:35:16,50
SOMEONE<Docherty> joins SOMEONE<Nanny>. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS465
01:35:22,00 --> 01:35:27,50
SOMEONE<McPhee> blinks wistfully. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS466
01:35:26,00 --> 01:35:32,50
She tenderly faces Mrs. SOMEONE<Docherty> with her snaggletooth smile. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS467
01:35:35,00 --> 01:35:56,50
The two share a warm smile and hug. SOMEONE<McPhee> peers toward the children, then steps away. Mrs. SOMEONE<Docherty> gazes after her tearfully, then faces the children with a sobbing breath. Now atop the hay bale, SOMEONE<Megsie> discovers the Medal for Resolve pinned to her overalls. SOMEONE<Celia> wears the Medal for Kindness. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS468
01:36:03,00 --> 01:36:11,50
SOMEONE<Vincent> has one too. As SOMEONE<Isabel> cherishes the Leaps of Faith Medal, SOMEONE<Norman> admires yet another. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS469
01:36:14,00 --> 01:36:18,50
SOMEONE<Megsie> points. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS470
01:36:16,00 --> 01:36:23,50
Shading his eyes, SOMEONE<Cyril> spots her halfway across the field. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS471
01:36:21,00 --> 01:36:26,50
Mr. Edelweiss takes flight. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS472
01:36:40,00 --> 01:36:44,50
SOMEONE's<Cyril's> got a medal too. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS473
01:37:01,00 --> 01:37:05,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> and the kids run off. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS474
01:37:07,00 --> 01:37:12,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Docherty> steps up beside his wife. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS476
01:37:27,00 --> 01:37:33,50
up the wooded road, SOMEONE leads the chase after her. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS477
01:37:50,00 --> 01:37:59,50
Leaving the woods, SOMEONE<Isabel> rounds a turn, stops running and stares. She steps forward. Her eyes wide. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS478
01:38:01,00 --> 01:38:06,50
The children catch up to her. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS479
01:38:05,00 --> 01:38:16,50
Taking in her emotional smile, they follow her gaze. Atop a distant ridge, SOMEONE swaps cordial bows with Rory. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS480
01:38:15,00 --> 01:38:24,50
He drops a duffle bag. With one arm in a sling, he raises the other in a wave and runs forward. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS481
01:38:23,00 --> 01:38:27,50
The kids dash out to meet him. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS482
01:38:26,00 --> 01:38:40,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> beams as her husband races to their children, his face illuminated by his warm toothy grin. Leading the others, SOMEONE<Norman> flings his arms around his father who scoops him up and spins him around. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS483
01:38:38,00 --> 01:38:43,50
him down. He lifts SOMEONE<Vincent> up in a big hug. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS484
01:38:45,00 --> 01:38:55,50
He kisses the boy's neck. SOMEONE<Isabel> joyfully strolls up to join them. Setting SOMEONE<Vincent> down, Rory straightens and meets her

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS485
01:38:53,00 --> 01:38:57,50
in a passionate kiss. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS486
01:38:55,00 --> 01:39:01,50
The two cling to each other in a fast embrace, then draw SOMEONE, SOMEONE 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS487
01:39:00,00 --> 01:39:04,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS488
01:39:02,00 --> 01:39:09,50
Facing them, Rory warmly extends a hand to his nephew. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS489
01:39:19,00 --> 01:39:24,50
Her snaggletooth gone from her lovely face, 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS490
01:39:25,00 --> 01:39:31,50
a warm smile brightens her pleasing features. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS491
01:39:35,00 --> 01:39:44,50
As the reunited family heads down hill, SOMEONE finds Mr. Edelweiss perched by her side. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS492
01:39:42,00 --> 01:39:46,50
She pets her shoulder. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS493
01:39:47,00 --> 01:39:59,50
He jumps up and down happily, then alights upon her shoulder. SOMEONE<McPhee> beams at the bird, then turns her back to us and strolls toward a gentle valley. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS494
01:39:58,00 --> 01:40:18,50
Back on the other side of the grassy ridge, wild flowers blanket the field between us and the distant SOMEONE<nanny>. Silhouetted against the sunny sky, the magical woman slowly descends out of view. Cut to black. Words appear. The end. SOMEONE's<McPhee's> silhouette appears in profile above them. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS495
01:40:19,00 --> 01:40:27,50
The figure taps her walking stick. We drift into the silhouette and find a cartoon where SOMEONE<Vincent> pedals the Scratch-o- matic

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS496
01:40:25,00 --> 01:40:29,50
The meters needle jumps to 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS497
01:40:28,00 --> 01:40:36,50
Our gaze flies along the contraption to three brushes, each scratching a piglet. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS499
01:40:41,00 --> 01:40:47,50
Five children peek out from her skirt, then tumble out and frolic away. 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS501
01:41:03,00 --> 01:41:08,50
The elephant gulps down the jam with his trunk. He sneezes some 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS503
01:41:12,00 --> 01:41:22,50
SOMEONE<Isabel> struggles to balance on a teeter-totter as she juggles the children. SOMEONE<Maggie> Gyllenhaal. Two piglets fly through the air using their floppy ears 

NANNY_MCPHEE_RETURNS_DVS506
01:41:27,00 --> 01:41:41,50
He lands in a puddle as the children mirthfully look on. Mr. SOMEONE<Docherty> takes him away in handcuffs. Now the shop drawer open and close by themselves. Mr. Edelweiss peeks out from one.
