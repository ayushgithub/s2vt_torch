PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS21
00:02:59,00 --> 00:03:03,50
With his hand on the fence. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS22
00:04:07,00 --> 00:04:14,50
Under his brother's glare, SOMEONE stops and faces him once more, 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS23
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:21,50
revealing a flood of brilliant light. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS24
00:04:21,00 --> 00:04:24,50
at Poseidon, 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS25
00:04:21,00 --> 00:04:28,50
then walks past the door's broken pieces and down a few steps to the doorway. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS26
00:04:28,00 --> 00:04:36,50
The hundreds of broken pieces fly back up and reform the door, sealing off the light. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS28
00:04:40,00 --> 00:04:45,50
A title swoops into view. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS29
00:04:44,00 --> 00:04:48,50
The Lightning Thief. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS30
00:04:48,00 --> 00:04:55,50
The image dissolves to a teenage boy who sits comfortably on the bottom of a swimming pool. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS37
00:06:41,00 --> 00:06:47,50
Later in class, a frumpish woman writes a quote on the chalkboard, 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS39
00:07:05,00 --> 00:07:10,50
then peers at the quote. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS40
00:07:10,00 --> 00:07:17,50
Read the letters of the Shakespearean line jumble on the chalkboard. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS42
00:07:30,00 --> 00:07:35,50
SOMEONE<Percy> arrives at a white brick apartment building. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS43
00:07:33,00 --> 00:07:38,50
Our view ascends along a fire escape. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS46
00:09:11,00 --> 00:09:15,50
He faces his mother. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS47
00:09:35,00 --> 00:09:43,50
A frustrated SOMEONE<Percy> steps outside onto the fire escape and scans the street below. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS48
00:09:43,00 --> 00:09:48,50
Metropolitan Museum of Art 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS49
00:09:46,00 --> 00:09:50,50
to the pillared entrance. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS50
00:09:50,00 --> 00:09:57,50
SOMEONE<Percy> accompanies his buddy who makes his way up the front steps on his crutches. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS51
00:10:08,00 --> 00:10:14,50
SOMEONE<Percy> notices the human Poseidon watching him from across the street. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS52
00:11:34,00 --> 00:11:38,50
he shrugs. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS53
00:11:45,00 --> 00:11:51,50
Words at the top, which jumble to read, 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS55
00:12:24,00 --> 00:12:29,50
back to his peers, then follows Ms. SOMEONE<Dodds> out. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS56
00:12:55,00 --> 00:13:06,50
Her clothes burst off and she morphs into a demonic six-winged creature. SOMEONE<Percy> dives onto the floor as the creature swoops to another perch. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS57
00:13:27,00 --> 00:13:37,50
With SOMEONE<Percy> on the floor, he grabs his shoulder, then scoots away as the monster bares her fangs at him. She flies out, smashing through a high window. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS59
00:15:40,00 --> 00:15:47,50
SOMEONE's<Percy's> friend stabs SOMEONE's<Gabe's> foot with the tip of his crutch, then whacks him in the groin. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS60
00:15:55,00 --> 00:16:02,50
Now at dusk. SOMEONE<Sally> drives the other two across the SOMEONE<George> Washington Bridge. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS61
00:17:07,00 --> 00:17:12,50
Our view descends to a herd of cattle. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS62
00:17:11,00 --> 00:17:15,50
A beast with horns, 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS63
00:17:23,00 --> 00:17:29,50
A car swerves and rolls onto its roof, then slides to a spinning top. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS64
00:17:56,00 --> 00:18:05,50
SOMEONE<Grover> stomps out the rear window. The giant horned beast charges in their direction. SOMEONE<Grover> crawls out. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS65
00:18:15,00 --> 00:18:20,50
SOMEONE<Grover> leads SOMEONE<Percy> and SOMEONE<Sally> over a fence. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS66
00:18:24,00 --> 00:18:32,50
As they race across the clearing, SOMEONE<Sally> looks back to see the minotaur lift her car overhead and throw it. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS67
00:18:30,00 --> 00:18:37,50
It hits the ground just ahead of them, bounces end-over-end and lands in a heap. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS68
00:18:47,00 --> 00:18:54,50
SOMEONE looks up and notices ancient Greek words, which transform to read, Camp Half-Blood, 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS69
00:18:53,00 --> 00:18:59,50
A translucent wall of energy stops SOMEONE. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS73
00:19:10,00 --> 00:19:14,50
SOMEONE<Percy> gapes. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS75
00:19:19,00 --> 00:19:35,50
SOMEONE<Percy> takes out the pen, which transforms into a sword. The minotaur crushes SOMEONE<Sally> with its fist and she vanishes in a plume of bright smoke. The beast 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS76
00:19:34,00 --> 00:20:19,50
SOMEONE<Percy> swipes wildly at it, then somersaults away from a punch but crashes into the ground. He strikes again, and the minotaur backhands him into a tree. As the beast charges, SOMEONE<Percy> gets up and dodges. The minotaur hits the tree trunk headfirst. With his left horn stuck, the minotaur yanks itself backwards. The horn snaps in two and the beast collapses, leaving the broken off tip lodged in the tree. SOMEONE<Percy> spots his sword near the minotaur then hurries around the tree and grabs the horn. SOMEONE<Percy> pulls out the horn tip and stabs the charging beast in the chest. The wounded minotaur straightens then falls on its back. SOMEONE<Percy> drops the horn. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS78
00:20:20,00 --> 00:20:27,50
SOMEONE<Grover> catches him. With his eyes closed, SOMEONE's<Percy's> head hangs to the side. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS79
00:20:31,00 --> 00:20:37,50
Two rows of cots line opposite walls in a spacious medical tent. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS80
00:20:38,00 --> 00:20:43,50
While medical workers tend to their patients. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS81
00:20:44,00 --> 00:20:49,50
He blinks groggily and rubs his eyes. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS82
00:20:54,00 --> 00:20:58,50
SOMEONE<Percy> sits up in his cot. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS83
00:20:57,00 --> 00:21:06,50
Glancing around he takes in his surroundings. He sees a person bandaging a patient's leg and a hand sponging a woman's forehead. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS91
00:22:08,00 --> 00:22:14,50
Outside people bustle around the campgrounds. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS95
00:22:23,00 --> 00:22:27,50
Archers almost shoot them. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS108
00:24:06,00 --> 00:24:20,50
His gaze drifts past her to another teenage girl being attached by a cluster of warriors. He gapes as she ducks a swinging sword from one fighter, then evades a blow from another and holds him at sword point. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS109
00:24:45,00 --> 00:24:54,50
He and SOMEONE<Percy> stand at the edge of the clearing and look out at the distant lakeshore. A herd of creatures gallops along the water. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS110
00:25:11,00 --> 00:25:17,50
They hurry to the centaur, who bears the teacher's upper body. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS111
00:25:39,00 --> 00:25:46,50
Now SOMEONE<Chiron> slows his pace as they reach a courtly-logged boathouse. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS112
00:25:43,00 --> 00:25:50,50
A lofty breezeway at its center leads from the shore onto the water. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS113
00:26:11,00 --> 00:26:15,50
They look at the boathouse. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS118
00:26:43,00 --> 00:26:49,50
He grabs the three-pronged spear by its shaft and examines it. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS124
00:28:51,00 --> 00:28:59,50
SOMEONE<Chiron> sidesteps impatiently as SOMEONE<Percy> turns and shoots a tentative look over his shoulder. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS126
00:29:26,00 --> 00:29:32,50
SOMEONE<Percy> wears chest armor as he follows SOMEONE<Grover> to the training field. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS127
00:29:47,00 --> 00:29:53,50
The students gather their weapons and form a crowd in front of SOMEONE<Chiron>. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS129
00:31:10,00 --> 00:31:14,50
Helmets line up. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS130
00:31:14,00 --> 00:31:20,50
They charge through the woods with their swords in one hand and their shields in the other. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS131
00:31:18,00 --> 00:31:25,50
A group of soldiers with blue crested helmets races through the trees. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS132
00:31:26,00 --> 00:31:37,50
A blue soldier jumps off a boulder and knocks a red opponent to the ground. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS133
00:31:35,00 --> 00:31:42,50
SOMEONE<Luke> and SOMEONE<Percy> race off, leaving the mass of battling warriors behind. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS134
00:31:42,00 --> 00:31:53,50
A red soldier charges up and SOMEONE<Percy> ducks his sword. As SOMEONE<Luke> fights the warrior a second opponent comes up from behind and tears off his helmet. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS135
00:31:50,00 --> 00:31:59,50
SOMEONE<Percy> starts to run away but the soldier jumps out and strikes at him. SOMEONE<Percy> falls back and kicks him away. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS136
00:32:04,00 --> 00:32:09,50
More sons of Ares surround the blue soldiers. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS137
00:32:10,00 --> 00:32:20,50
SOMEONE<Luke> fights off two opponents while SOMEONE<Percy> swordfights nimbly and dodges a blow. SOMEONE<Luke> pushes him out of the way and sweeps out a warrior's leg. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS138
00:32:17,00 --> 00:32:23,50
SOMEONE<Percy> bashes an opponent to the ground and stares disbelievingly. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS139
00:32:37,00 --> 00:32:43,50
He drops to his knees at the water's edge and dips his hands in the stream. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS140
00:32:41,00 --> 00:32:49,50
Palms to his face he notices a red flag hanging from a pole on the opposite bank. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS141
00:32:52,00 --> 00:32:58,50
Which splashes at his knees as he moves across the stream. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS142
00:33:27,00 --> 00:33:34,50
As he stumbles back, SOMEONE<Chiron> and SOMEONE<Grover> appear on the bank, some distance away. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS143
00:33:33,00 --> 00:33:39,50
SOMEONE<Annabeth> parries his blows, then elbows him in the chest. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS144
00:33:36,00 --> 00:33:44,50
Red warriors gather behind SOMEONE<Percy> as SOMEONE<Annabeth> blocks another swing then knees her opponent. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS145
00:33:49,00 --> 00:33:55,50
SOMEONE<Annabeth> advances, slicing SOMEONE's<Percy's> arm and cutting his leg. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS146
00:34:03,00 --> 00:34:10,50
SOMEONE<Annabeth> ducks and strikes his armor. He falls to his knees and she kicks him to the ground. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS147
00:34:12,00 --> 00:34:17,50
SOMEONE<Annabeth> watches him over her shoulder. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS148
00:34:20,00 --> 00:34:27,50
Pump their fists and wave their swords. She glances back at SOMEONE<Percy>. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS149
00:34:27,00 --> 00:34:34,50
Our view hovers over him and spins slowly as we descend upon him. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS151
00:34:46,00 --> 00:34:52,50
Her lips parted curiously as SOMEONE dips his hand in the water. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS152
00:35:00,00 --> 00:35:04,50
then moves to his shoulder. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS153
00:35:01,00 --> 00:35:08,50
Water glistens on SOMEONE's<Percy's> cheek as the gash on his face closes up. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS154
00:35:14,00 --> 00:35:20,50
He glances from the sword in his hand, the healed cut on his palm. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS155
00:35:20,00 --> 00:35:25,50
heave[unclear]s as she stares with wide eyes. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS156
00:35:22,00 --> 00:35:29,50
SOMEONE<Luke> hurriedly joins the gathered warriors on the banks to watch. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS157
00:35:28,00 --> 00:35:33,50
In slow motion one of them charges at him. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS158
00:35:37,00 --> 00:35:44,50
He defeats two more opponents then spins around and strikes an attacking soldier in the chest. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS160
00:35:47,00 --> 00:35:51,50
SOMEONE<Luke> nods proudly. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS161
00:35:57,00 --> 00:36:04,50
The son of Poseidon blocks his opponent's sword with his own, then elbows him in the back. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS162
00:36:03,00 --> 00:36:10,50
SOMEONE<Percy> aims his weapon at her, its tip stopping within inches of her throat. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS163
00:36:08,00 --> 00:36:15,50
The two battle fiercely, parrying and dodging each other's blows 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS164
00:36:14,00 --> 00:36:21,50
then pulls SOMEONE's<Annabeth's> sword from her grasp and turns its blade against the back of her neck. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS165
00:36:32,00 --> 00:36:38,50
As SOMEONE<Percy> saunters away he twirls his sword like a propeller blade at his side. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS166
00:36:40,00 --> 00:36:46,50
He makes his way through a crowd of red soldiers who part to let him by. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS167
00:36:45,00 --> 00:36:50,50
The two opponents guarding the red flag. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS168
00:36:51,00 --> 00:36:56,50
He takes a flag on its wooden pole. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS169
00:37:05,00 --> 00:37:12,50
Beside him, SOMEONE<Chiron> gives a nod and raises his staff in congratulations. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS170
00:37:18,00 --> 00:37:23,50
A pig on a spit over a fire. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS171
00:37:22,00 --> 00:37:30,50
SOMEONE<Grover> holds up SOMEONE's<Percy's> arm like a boxing champion as they push through the crowd toward a refreshment table. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS173
00:38:58,00 --> 00:39:03,50
Winged demon emerges from the burst of fire. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS174
00:39:00,00 --> 00:39:07,50
Flames surround its lower body and dance across its broad wingspan. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS175
00:39:12,00 --> 00:39:21,50
A fireball appears in the demon's hand. He hurls it at a food table which explodes. SOMEONE<Percy> and SOMEONE<Annabeth> step back. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS176
00:39:22,00 --> 00:39:28,50
One explodes a few feet from SOMEONE<Percy> and SOMEONE<Annabeth>. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS177
00:39:37,00 --> 00:39:43,50
SOMEONE's<Percy's> eyes narrow. SOMEONE<Luke> watches Hades with an odd expression. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS178
00:40:09,00 --> 00:40:16,50
A ball of flames appears in his palm and he lowers it for SOMEONE<Percy> to see. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS180
00:40:31,00 --> 00:40:37,50
Hades bursts into flames which rise into the air and disappear. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS181
00:41:15,00 --> 00:41:23,50
The satyr meets his friends gaze and nods. SOMEONE<Percy> turns away and closes his eyes. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS182
00:41:24,00 --> 00:41:31,50
SOMEONE<Percy> slings his backpack over his shoulder as he leaves the boathouse. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS183
00:41:43,00 --> 00:41:48,50
Arrows in a canvas sack. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS184
00:43:14,00 --> 00:43:22,50
Now they arrive at an open-air home similar to the boathouse, decked out with gauzy drapes and burning candles. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS185
00:43:37,00 --> 00:43:44,50
Side-by-side flat screens display SOMEONE's<Luke's> video game. Electronics clutter a nearby table. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS186
00:44:24,00 --> 00:44:29,50
The shoebox and blows dust of the lid 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS187
00:44:39,00 --> 00:44:45,50
A pair of Chuck Taylor High Tops with wings. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS188
00:45:04,00 --> 00:45:10,50
SOMEONE<Luke> drops the shoe in the box and the newcomer quickly closes it. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS189
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:05,50
Across the top of the map. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS190
00:46:25,00 --> 00:46:32,50
As his friends edge away, SOMEONE<Percy> slides his arm through its straps and grasps its handle. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS191
00:46:54,00 --> 00:47:00,50
A Greyhound bus pulls over at a deserted stop. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS192
00:47:01,00 --> 00:47:08,50
SOMEONE<Grover> uses his crutches as he, SOMEONE<Annabeth> and SOMEONE<Percy> exit at the side of the road. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS193
00:47:05,00 --> 00:47:16,50
Now a weathered sign reads Auntie Em's Garden Emporium. A breeze blows dead leaves across the store's parking lot as the teens arrive. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS194
00:47:13,00 --> 00:47:20,50
Life-sized statues of men and women in ancient Greek attire adorn entryway. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS195
00:47:21,00 --> 00:47:28,50
They pass under a welcome sign and enter a stone gray clobbered building. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS196
00:47:38,00 --> 00:47:43,50
It's crawling with mice. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS197
00:47:58,00 --> 00:48:02,50
And peers into a freestanding fountain. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS198
00:48:24,00 --> 00:48:30,50
And SOMEONE<Annabeth> ventures farther into the greenhouse. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS199
00:48:28,00 --> 00:48:38,50
Outside SOMEONE<Percy> wanders down a path, bordered with overgrown vegetations and statues of people in Medieval and Renaissance fashions. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS200
00:48:36,00 --> 00:48:43,50
Tall plants block SOMEONE's<Annabeth's> view on either side as she heads farther back. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS201
00:48:55,00 --> 00:49:01,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Grover> finds a statue of a Satyr with ram's horns. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS203
00:49:48,00 --> 00:49:54,50
As SOMEONE's<Percy's> and SOMEONE's<Grover's> path cross, they collide and hit the ground. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS204
00:50:04,00 --> 00:50:11,50
A tall woman in a turban and oversized sunglasses blocks their path. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS205
00:51:52,00 --> 00:52:06,50
The woman's eyes turn into granite like stone that spreads over her entire body. SOMEONE<Annabeth> wriggles her wrist in the woman's rock-hard grasp. SOMEONE<Percy> and SOMEONE<Grover> hide behind a nearby statue. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS206
00:52:26,00 --> 00:52:31,50
SOMEONE<Percy> watches her reflection in his Smartphone. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS207
00:52:29,00 --> 00:52:37,50
SOMEONE<Medusa> circles SOMEONE<Annabeth>, then squats down and lifts her face close to hers. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS208
00:53:13,00 --> 00:53:26,50
Chasing him, SOMEONE<Medusa> halts at an intersection, then instinctively turns. SOMEONE<Percy> crouches behind a statue and holds up his phone. As SOMEONE<Medusa> arrives nearby it catches her reflection. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS209
00:53:35,00 --> 00:53:45,50
She shoves the statue, which knocks into another, creating a domino effect that topples an entire row. The last statue traps SOMEONE<Percy>. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS211
00:53:57,00 --> 00:54:05,50
As SOMEONE<Percy> reaches for his sword, SOMEONE<Medusa> kicks it away, hauls him to his feet and pulls him close. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS212
00:54:58,00 --> 00:55:11,50
An antiquated pickup barrels into the greenhouse, plowing through statues. SOMEONE<Percy> dives for cover and SOMEONE<Medusa> falls. Behind the wheel SOMEONE<Annabeth> sits up, her eyes clamped shut. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS213
00:55:15,00 --> 00:55:23,50
As the dust clears, SOMEONE<Medusa> rolls over among the broken statues and crawls toward SOMEONE<Percy>. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS214
00:55:25,00 --> 00:55:30,50
Standing she peers quizzically at her reflection. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS215
00:55:30,00 --> 00:55:35,50
SOMEONE<Medusa> gapes as he swings his sword. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS217
00:55:39,00 --> 00:55:47,50
SOMEONE's<Medusa's> severed head lies on the ground by SOMEONE's<Percy's> phone and her lifeless hand. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS218
00:56:35,00 --> 00:56:41,50
A bracelet with a green shimmering pearl coils around SOMEONE's<Medusa's> wrist. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS219
00:57:00,00 --> 00:57:08,50
Over the southeastern states a small-labeled drawing of a columned building blazes into view. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS220
00:57:23,00 --> 00:57:29,50
The truck veers into the path of an oncoming big rig. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS221
00:57:29,00 --> 00:57:38,50
SOMEONE<Grover> swerves away from the big rig, then cuts across approaching traffic as he returns to the proper lane. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS222
00:57:46,00 --> 00:57:52,50
SOMEONE<Percy> sits at the bottom of the pool, clasping his bent knees. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS224
00:58:04,00 --> 00:58:12,50
Hades sweeps an enormous demonic hand through her form, obliterating it in a ball of flames. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS225
00:58:42,00 --> 00:58:49,50
He lowers a hand back into the pool and touches his fingertips to hers. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS226
00:58:46,00 --> 00:58:53,50
A glistening stream of water trickles up from his hand to her arm. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS227
01:01:13,00 --> 01:01:19,50
SOMEONE<Annabeth> shuts the curtains and faces him. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS228
01:01:29,00 --> 01:01:36,50
Later the truck turns down a road bordered with well-tended flowering trees and shrubs. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS229
01:01:36,00 --> 01:01:42,50
Where a pristine replica of the long, multi columned Parthenon stands. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS230
01:01:40,00 --> 01:01:47,50
Now children play around a man making giant soap bubbles on the park lawn. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS231
01:01:46,00 --> 01:01:52,50
Centennial Park. The Parthenon. Entrance and parking. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS232
01:01:54,00 --> 01:01:59,50
As they approach the Parthenon's entrance 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS235
01:02:08,00 --> 01:02:15,50
Now sunlight fans out across the marble floor as a pair of doors swing open. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS236
01:02:20,00 --> 01:02:28,50
Features a beautiful warrior goddess with long curls spilling out from under her crested helmet. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS237
01:02:27,00 --> 01:02:33,50
Its Greek text translates to read Athena. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS238
01:02:56,00 --> 01:03:02,50
Gleams from the center of a gold band encircling Athena's helmet. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS239
01:03:34,00 --> 01:03:39,50
The teens emerge. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS240
01:04:15,00 --> 01:04:20,50
SOMEONE<Annabeth> shoots another custodian. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS241
01:04:18,00 --> 01:04:27,50
She takes down one janitor after another. Her final dart hits a janitor's thigh and he falls from a tall ladder. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS242
01:04:32,00 --> 01:04:40,50
Later SOMEONE<Grover> drags the janitor across the polished floor, pulling him behind a line of columns. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS243
01:05:03,00 --> 01:05:07,50
with his hands together. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS244
01:05:09,00 --> 01:05:16,50
He flails his limbs, struggling for control as he soars at the statue. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS245
01:05:15,00 --> 01:05:23,50
As he slips down the front of Athena's robes, he catches himself on a marbled lock of hair. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS246
01:05:23,00 --> 01:05:33,50
The shoes wings flutter as SOMEONE<Percy> scrambles up the front of the statue, using Athena's hair and folds of her robe as hand and foot holds. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS249
01:05:45,00 --> 01:05:50,50
He removes the pearl from its setting. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS250
01:06:29,00 --> 01:06:35,50
Mist rises around the custodians as they drift close together. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS251
01:06:35,00 --> 01:06:39,50
Grey hide underneath. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS252
01:06:37,00 --> 01:06:48,50
The teens nervously edge back as the janitors bodies join into one, their necks stretching and coiling upward to create a five-headed SOMEONE<dragon> like beast. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS253
01:06:52,00 --> 01:06:59,50
The teens dug behind a row of columns. The hydra heaves flames at them. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS254
01:06:58,00 --> 01:07:08,50
As he tries to shake the fire out, the pearl slips from his grasp. It rolls away and settles on top of a floor grate. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS255
01:07:07,00 --> 01:07:12,50
Then dons his shield and draws his sword. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS256
01:07:12,00 --> 01:07:18,50
Another head disarms SOMEONE<Grover>, who scrambles back. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS258
01:07:22,00 --> 01:07:33,50
SOMEONE<Percy> bashes the heads with his shield, then runs out brandishing his sword. His sneakers lift him into the air where he continues his assault. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS259
01:07:32,00 --> 01:07:37,50
But he flies out of its path. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS260
01:07:36,00 --> 01:07:40,50
Then slices through its neck. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS262
01:07:47,00 --> 01:07:55,50
SOMEONE<Percy> barrels aside, then hacks through its neck. The head lands beside the mammoth body. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS263
01:08:11,00 --> 01:08:17,50
The center ones spew fire at the teens. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS264
01:08:15,00 --> 01:08:19,50
They take cover behind the columns. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS265
01:08:22,00 --> 01:08:32,50
She draws another arrow, shoots again and pierces one of the hydra's eyes. It turns to pursue her and she darts away. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS266
01:08:29,00 --> 01:08:35,50
As SOMEONE<Percy> runs in the opposite direction, one of the heads spots him. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS267
01:08:35,00 --> 01:08:41,50
SOMEONE<Percy> reaches for the pearl, misses and faces the charging hydra. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS268
01:08:44,00 --> 01:08:54,50
SOMEONE<Percy> scrambles behind a pedestal, flings away his smoking shield and examines his scorched hand. He peeks out at the pearl. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS269
01:08:55,00 --> 01:09:00,50
Spews fire and he takes cover again. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS270
01:08:59,00 --> 01:09:06,50
SOMEONE<Percy> edges away, then notices two water fountains on a nearby wall. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS271
01:09:05,00 --> 01:09:14,50
SOMEONE<Percy> shuts his eyes. A hydra head swivels around the corner, fiery light crackling in its throat. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS272
01:09:14,00 --> 01:09:35,50
Water gushes out, quickly flooding the floor. Under the teen's control it forms a wall between him and the hydra. As it pushes the creature back, SOMEONE<Percy> creeps out, snatches the pearl and joins his friends. Grabbing his backpack he leads them to the exit. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS273
01:09:35,00 --> 01:09:54,50
SOMEONE<Grover> faces the hydra. From his bag he produces SOMEONE's<Medusa's> head. As the hydra spews twinjets of fire at him, he raises the dead woman's sunglasses, exposing her eyes. An invisible barrier halts the flames about a foot from her stare. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS274
01:09:55,00 --> 01:09:59,50
Her snakes go limp. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS275
01:09:59,00 --> 01:10:07,50
His two friends stare as well. The hydra's heads become motionless as they turn to stone. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS276
01:10:05,00 --> 01:10:11,50
SOMEONE<Grover> lowers SOMEONE's<Medusa's> head and his awestruck friends step up behind him. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS277
01:10:19,00 --> 01:10:25,50
Now a TV in a diner shows a news report as the young heroes eat. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS282
01:11:02,00 --> 01:11:12,50
Now the pickup travels past an airport tarmac situated across the street from a sign reading Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas, Nevada. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS283
01:11:13,00 --> 01:11:18,50
As the truck drives through the strip 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS284
01:11:24,00 --> 01:11:31,50
a fountain jets water in front of a cluster of towering hotel/casinos. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS285
01:11:30,00 --> 01:11:37,50
They pass a row of older casinos blaring flashy lights. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS286
01:11:42,00 --> 01:11:49,50
Fireworks blossom over a pair of high rises lit in a pinstriped pattern. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS287
01:11:47,00 --> 01:11:56,50
An illuminated logo shows a dark pink dome-shaped flower over the words Lotus Hotel and Casino. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS288
01:11:53,00 --> 01:12:01,50
Below the pickup pulls into an extravagantly lit drop-off area with limos and taxis. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS289
01:12:18,00 --> 01:12:27,50
Inside a lavish buffet with a chocolate fountain overlooks a brand new black Maserati on a rotating platform. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS290
01:12:28,00 --> 01:12:35,50
The teens eye the sports car, then head to the casino's crowded gaming area. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS291
01:12:57,00 --> 01:13:03,50
Elaborate roller coasters and a SOMEONE<ferris> wheel loom behind a fountain. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS292
01:13:08,00 --> 01:13:15,50
As they move on a waitress intercepts them with a tray of pink hors d'oeuvre. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS294
01:13:50,00 --> 01:13:54,50
Wide eyes shifting. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS295
01:13:51,00 --> 01:13:59,50
With a raised eyebrow SOMEONE<Grover> looks around as he slowly chews, then grins merrily. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS296
01:14:40,00 --> 01:14:47,50
Now, SOMEONE<Grover> struts through the casino, flanked by an entourage of gorgeous women. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS297
01:14:46,00 --> 01:14:50,50
And another feeds him a lotus flower. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS298
01:14:52,00 --> 01:14:58,50
A waitress presents a tray of lotus flowers to them. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS299
01:14:58,00 --> 01:15:12,50
Now SOMEONE<Grover> reclines in a plush white bathrobe with cucumber slices over his eyes. A buxom manicurist files his nails, while a pedicurist paints his cloven hooves cherry red. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS300
01:15:14,00 --> 01:15:19,50
As SOMEONE<Percy> and SOMEONE<Annabeth> look on. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS301
01:15:18,00 --> 01:15:24,50
He drops into a split, then springs up using only his goat legs. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS302
01:15:26,00 --> 01:15:31,50
Perfectly synchronized series of movements. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS303
01:15:52,00 --> 01:15:57,50
As he moves through the casino a waitress intercepts him. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS304
01:15:58,00 --> 01:16:04,50
He reaches a crowded video game arcade and pauses, gazing about. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS305
01:16:11,00 --> 01:16:19,50
He stops at a pinball machine played by a thin young man with long, corn silk hair. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS306
01:16:45,00 --> 01:16:52,50
He turns away and heads through a 1950s themed recreation area. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS307
01:17:01,00 --> 01:17:07,50
He passes a craps table, then comes to a roulette game. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS308
01:17:06,00 --> 01:17:16,50
A softly glowing green pearl sits nestled in one of the slots. As SOMEONE<Percy> stares at it a waitress swoops in behind him. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS309
01:17:22,00 --> 01:17:27,50
SOMEONE<Percy> eyes him wearily. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS310
01:17:27,00 --> 01:17:34,50
Wearing an earpiece the bellhop speaks discreetly into a small microphone. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS311
01:17:33,00 --> 01:17:39,50
SOMEONE<Percy> returns to the club and finds SOMEONE<Annabeth> about to eat a lotus flower. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS312
01:18:24,00 --> 01:18:32,50
SOMEONE<Percy> leads SOMEONE<Annabeth> off. SOMEONE<Grover> holds his crutches out as he runs separately. A group of guards surround him. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS313
01:18:33,00 --> 01:18:52,50
SOMEONE<Grover> kicks a guard with both feet then fights off two more with his crutches. As they run into the gaming area, SOMEONE<Percy> shoulder checks a casino worker. SOMEONE<Annabeth> grabs a pool queue and swings it like a staff. She takes down a guard. SOMEONE<Percy> leaps on to the roulette table, fights off two casino workers and grabs the pearl. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS316
01:19:18,00 --> 01:19:35,50
The sports car plows through a pair of glass doors and speeds out of the brightly lit drop-off area. Cutting through a busy intersection, the Maserati swerves into the flow of traffic, then races past the other cars. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS317
01:20:04,00 --> 01:20:10,50
A blaze of lights sears words next to the Southwestern coast. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS318
01:20:17,00 --> 01:20:25,50
SOMEONE<Grover> clenches the steering wheel. The Maserati weaves around the other cars as it speeds down the strip. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS319
01:20:24,00 --> 01:20:29,50
Drive carefully. Come back soon. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS320
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:36,50
The sports car races through a barren desert landscape under a sky darkened with storm clouds. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS321
01:20:35,00 --> 01:20:40,50
Thunderheads swirl over the iconic Hollywood sign. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS322
01:20:40,00 --> 01:20:45,50
The radio plays a news report. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS323
01:20:59,00 --> 01:21:06,50
Later the teens scramble along the base of its freestanding letters. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS324
01:21:09,00 --> 01:21:15,50
Graffitied Greek letters rearrange themselves to form a message in English. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS325
01:21:19,00 --> 01:21:24,50
Then stares past the sign, 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS326
01:21:23,00 --> 01:21:29,50
where the earth grumbles away to make a door sized fissure. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS327
01:21:32,00 --> 01:21:37,50
Cavernous space. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS328
01:21:35,00 --> 01:21:41,50
Glow from circular recesses in the walls. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS329
01:21:38,00 --> 01:21:44,50
As the teens follow a path along a broad, tranquil river 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS330
01:21:43,00 --> 01:21:47,50
fill the doorway behind him. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS331
01:22:00,00 --> 01:22:06,50
They find a gaunt man in a monk like robe standing in a rowboat. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS332
01:22:05,00 --> 01:22:09,50
his bony features. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS333
01:22:14,00 --> 01:22:18,50
SOMEONE<Percy> leads his friends over. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS334
01:23:07,00 --> 01:23:12,50
It bursts into flames. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS336
01:23:20,00 --> 01:23:26,50
The ferryman looks at him then extends his hand. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS337
01:23:25,00 --> 01:23:31,50
And the man closes his bony fingers around them. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS338
01:23:36,00 --> 01:23:43,50
As the teens take their seats the ferryman pushes away from the dock. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS339
01:23:49,00 --> 01:23:57,50
The boat exits through a freestanding letter H in a towering hillside sign that reads Hell. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS340
01:23:59,00 --> 01:24:05,50
SOMEONE<Percy> points at a trail of floating objects. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS341
01:24:20,00 --> 01:24:25,50
then releases it into the stream of discarded objects. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS342
01:24:24,00 --> 01:24:29,50
on the jagged edge of a cliff. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS343
01:24:40,00 --> 01:24:48,50
He shifts his gaze to an ominous mansion, which looms on a column of rock in the middle of the gorge. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS344
01:24:54,00 --> 01:25:01,50
Old-fashioned lamp posts bookend either side of a docking area. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS345
01:25:06,00 --> 01:25:10,50
Climb out of the boat. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS347
01:25:14,00 --> 01:25:19,50
A three-tiered fountain sits in the foyer. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS350
01:26:03,00 --> 01:26:06,50
He gulps. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS351
01:26:22,00 --> 01:26:28,50
Now the teens follow SOMEONE<Persephone> into an enormous sitting room. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS352
01:26:31,00 --> 01:26:39,50
Carved reliefs of bound, emaciated men flank a tall fireplace. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS353
01:26:50,00 --> 01:26:59,50
He wears a leather vest and pants, and a black shirt with stylishly tattered sleeves. Facing SOMEONE<Percy>, he spreads his arms. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS354
01:27:24,00 --> 01:27:29,50
He morphs into the giant winged demon. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS356
01:28:16,00 --> 01:28:21,50
Then gives Hades an apologetic smile. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS357
01:28:48,00 --> 01:28:56,50
He picks up a globe made of bones and smashes it on the ground. The shattered pieces dissolve into smoke. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS358
01:29:02,00 --> 01:29:08,50
Cloud takes on human form and materializes into SOMEONE<Sally>. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS359
01:29:08,00 --> 01:29:14,50
Flickers from behind the shield's arm strap. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS360
01:29:28,00 --> 01:29:34,50
Then holds him out at arm's length and gazes tearfully at him. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS361
01:29:32,00 --> 01:29:37,50
Their attention to Hades. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS362
01:29:34,00 --> 01:29:43,50
SOMEONE<Percy> and SOMEONE<Sally> also watch as the god of the underworld stoops down and shifts the arm strap aside on the shield. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS363
01:29:42,00 --> 01:29:47,50
which grows longer as he pulls it out. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS365
01:30:39,00 --> 01:30:45,50
They stalk closer, backing SOMEONE<Percy> and the others toward the souls. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS366
01:30:46,00 --> 01:30:51,50
Pushing the group to within a few feet of the fire. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS367
01:31:16,00 --> 01:31:20,50
SOMEONE<Persephone> skips. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS368
01:31:23,00 --> 01:31:30,50
They stop their advance and the fireplace grate closes behind the group. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS369
01:31:30,00 --> 01:31:36,50
With the bolt clutched in her hand, SOMEONE<Persephone> kneels beside Hades. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS371
01:32:10,00 --> 01:32:16,50
Taking the bolt from SOMEONE<Persephone> he retrieves the glowing pearls from his pocket. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS374
01:33:08,00 --> 01:33:15,50
He, SOMEONE<Annabeth> and SOMEONE<Sally> place their pearls on the floor, then crush them under their feet. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS375
01:33:16,00 --> 01:33:22,50
Billows out, engulfing their legs and travels up their bodies. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS376
01:33:23,00 --> 01:33:28,50
which snakes its way out of the room. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS377
01:33:25,00 --> 01:33:32,50
SOMEONE<Grover> and SOMEONE<Persephone> watch as the smoky trail disappears. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS378
01:33:35,00 --> 01:33:39,50
She wiggles an inviting finger. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS379
01:33:45,00 --> 01:33:54,50
A smoking trail zooms through the night sky making its way past the pointed art deco crown of the Chrysler Building. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS380
01:33:52,00 --> 01:33:59,50
It swoops through the protective fence that surrounds the Empire State Building's observation deck. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS381
01:33:58,00 --> 01:34:03,50
Then morphs into SOMEONE<Annabeth>, SOMEONE<Percy>, and SOMEONE<Sally>. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS382
01:34:12,00 --> 01:34:18,50
SOMEONE<Annabeth> points to dark storm clouds gathering above the building's pinnacle. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS384
01:35:18,00 --> 01:35:25,50
Hovering in the air, SOMEONE<Luke> swings his legs around and kicks SOMEONE<Percy> in the head. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS385
01:35:22,00 --> 01:35:31,50
The Lightning Thief pulls out his sword. Sparks fly as SOMEONE<Percy> deflects his blow with a lightning bolt. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS386
01:35:29,00 --> 01:35:36,50
SOMEONE<Luke> kicks him, knocking him to the ground. The bolt falls from his hand. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS387
01:35:34,00 --> 01:35:39,50
But SOMEONE<Luke> swoops past her and grabs it. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS389
01:36:17,00 --> 01:36:24,50
The three companions fall to the floor as lightning zaps the safety barrier behind them. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS390
01:36:24,00 --> 01:36:32,50
With a power hungry smile, SOMEONE<Luke> blasts away a chunk of the deck. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS394
01:36:35,00 --> 01:36:41,50
SOMEONE<Percy> scrambles to his backpack and pulls out his own pair of flying sneakers. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS395
01:36:51,00 --> 01:36:57,50
He spots a helicopter rising in his direction and takes aim with the bolt. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS396
01:36:58,00 --> 01:37:05,50
A flying SOMEONE knocks him from the ledge, and they plummet past the observation deck, 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS397
01:37:03,00 --> 01:37:10,50
circle each other and come together again in a fierce grasp. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS398
01:37:08,00 --> 01:37:18,50
SOMEONE<Percy> swings at SOMEONE's<Luke's> face, then pins him against the building. The SOMEONE's<villain's> back grinds against the wall as he continues to plunge downward. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS399
01:37:22,00 --> 01:37:27,50
SOMEONE<Percy> lands on a slanted roof. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS400
01:37:28,00 --> 01:37:34,50
He steers himself toward an unfinished skyscraper. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS401
01:37:31,00 --> 01:37:37,50
SOMEONE<Luke> shoots it with lightning as SOMEONE<Percy> swoops through an open floor. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS403
01:37:48,00 --> 01:37:53,50
SOMEONE<Percy> bursts through a wall and grabs him. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS404
01:37:53,00 --> 01:37:58,50
It tumbles out of the building. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS405
01:37:57,00 --> 01:38:04,50
He soars back toward the Empire State Building his shoes' wings beating furiously. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS407
01:38:05,00 --> 01:38:14,50
SOMEONE<Luke> throws a dagger. It slices off one of SOMEONE's<Percy's> wings. The hero plummets, losing his grip on the bolt. As it tumbles toward a rooftop with a glowing skylight. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS408
01:38:13,00 --> 01:38:19,50
As it tumbles toward a rooftop with a glowing skylight. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS409
01:38:21,00 --> 01:38:26,50
Then weakly pushes himself up on all fours. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS410
01:38:31,00 --> 01:38:34,50
In the bolt. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS412
01:38:45,00 --> 01:38:52,50
Eyeing a water tower behind SOMEONE<Luke>, SOMEONE<Percy> shuts his eyes. The SOMEONE<villain> grins smugly. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS413
01:38:50,00 --> 01:38:55,50
He takes aim. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS414
01:38:55,00 --> 01:39:05,50
Turning, SOMEONE<Luke> sees water jet from its splitting seams. The tank's cap flies off and its contents gush out in a swirling arc. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS415
01:39:03,00 --> 01:39:16,50
Another vat nearby bursts open and the two streams converge. SOMEONE<Percy> unleashes water from two more tanks, and it all combines to form a giant flowing barrier around the rooftop. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS416
01:39:15,00 --> 01:39:21,50
The son of Poseidon holds the water at bay on either side of himself. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS417
01:39:20,00 --> 01:39:39,50
SOMEONE<Percy> flings his hands forward. The SOMEONE<villain> fires, but the water rushes in at him. It douses the charge and engulfs him. Energy crackles within the swirling mass. The maelstrom tosses SOMEONE<Luke> about like a toy and the bolt wrenches from his grasp. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS418
01:39:40,00 --> 01:39:45,50
Which evaporate in the nighttime air. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS419
01:39:53,00 --> 01:40:00,50
SOMEONE<Percy> bends over, resting his hands on his knees. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS420
01:40:06,00 --> 01:40:13,50
Water rises to form a trident in the hero's hand. Catching the SOMEONE<villain> around the throat it sends him flying out into a river. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS421
01:40:17,00 --> 01:40:24,50
Catching the SOMEONE<villain> around the throat it sends him flying out into a river. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS422
01:40:28,00 --> 01:40:34,50
SOMEONE's<Luke's> winged sneakers flap uselessly beside it. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS423
01:40:32,00 --> 01:40:40,50
SOMEONE<Percy> carries the bolt in one hand and his sword in the other as he lands on the observation deck. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS424
01:40:42,00 --> 01:40:55,50
In a supply closet, SOMEONE<Sally> flips some switches on an electrical panel. Across the room two shelving units part to reveal double doors, which slide open, displaying the interior of an elevator. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS425
01:40:53,00 --> 01:40:59,50
The Greek letter Omega gleams in the center of a sun emblem. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS426
01:41:00,00 --> 01:41:06,50
The lights flicker as they brace themselves inside the turbulent chamber 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS427
01:41:06,00 --> 01:41:11,50
Then burst from its pinnacle. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS428
01:41:11,00 --> 01:41:20,50
Our view drifts past storm clouds to four towering pillars stationed around a stone booth on a platform. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS429
01:41:19,00 --> 01:41:24,50
And SOMEONE<Percy> steps out with SOMEONE<Annabeth>. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS430
01:41:39,00 --> 01:41:46,50
The base of a magnificent palace illuminating its columned facade. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS431
01:41:44,00 --> 01:41:50,50
Timepiece sits in the center of a grand hall. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS432
01:41:49,00 --> 01:41:54,50
While SOMEONE<Zeus> watches from a throne. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS433
01:41:54,00 --> 01:42:04,50
The gods obediently take their seats in a semi-circle of white chairs. SOMEONE<Zeus> rises from his throne at the center and eyes the timepiece. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS434
01:42:02,00 --> 01:42:09,50
A clockwork second hand rotates above panes of glass. With astrological markings. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS436
01:42:31,00 --> 01:42:40,50
Casts onto the diminutive figures of the teens. The gods tower over them at more than 30 feet. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS438
01:42:45,00 --> 01:42:52,50
SOMEONE<Zeus>, Poseidon, and the goddess with the long brown curls stare down at the teens. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS439
01:42:52,00 --> 01:43:00,50
The demigods rush forward to meet him. He leans down and holds out his monstrous hand. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS440
01:43:04,00 --> 01:43:10,50
In SOMEONE's<Zeus's> hand the bolt grows in size and intensity. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS442
01:43:29,00 --> 01:43:35,50
SOMEONE<Zeus> glances at a brown haired god who blinks confusedly. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS443
01:43:42,00 --> 01:43:45,50
At Poseidon. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS444
01:43:44,00 --> 01:43:49,50
Then shifts his proud gaze to his son. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS445
01:43:46,00 --> 01:43:52,50
SOMEONE<Annabeth> glances at SOMEONE<Percy>, who firmly holds SOMEONE's<Zeus's> stare. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS447
01:43:56,00 --> 01:44:00,50
To his seat. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS448
01:43:57,00 --> 01:44:04,50
The beautiful goddess eyes the bolt-toting god as he sits. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS449
01:45:10,00 --> 01:45:15,50
SOMEONE<Annabeth> touches the boy's shoulder. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS451
01:45:38,00 --> 01:45:44,50
Poseidon morphs into water and catches up with his son in human form. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS452
01:47:23,00 --> 01:47:30,50
Poseidon extends his arm and they shake hands while sharing an amicable stare. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS453
01:47:32,00 --> 01:47:36,50
Then he walks off 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS457
01:50:19,00 --> 01:50:26,50
They stop walking as they notice SOMEONE<Annabeth> sword fighting four male students at the same time. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS459
01:50:36,00 --> 01:50:43,50
As SOMEONE<Percy> continues across the lawn, more students pat his back. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS460
01:50:47,00 --> 01:50:51,50
Blood caked on her shoulder. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS461
01:50:53,00 --> 01:50:57,50
Then raises his hand. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS462
01:51:17,00 --> 01:51:22,50
But SOMEONE<Annabeth> snatches his sword. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS464
01:51:30,00 --> 01:51:34,50
She keep sword at his throat. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS465
01:51:36,00 --> 01:51:43,50
They each twirl their weapons in preparation and position themselves for a fight. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS466
01:51:44,00 --> 01:51:50,50
SOMEONE<Annabeth> blocks two of his strikes and swipes back at him. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS467
01:51:49,00 --> 01:51:56,50
Our view widens to take in all of the battling demigods on the training field. 

PERCY_JACKSON_LIGHTENING_THIEF_DVS468
01:51:54,00 --> 01:52:05,50
We keep pulling back until our view encompasses the entire clearing, the surrounding forest and the lakeshore, which meanders off into the distance.
