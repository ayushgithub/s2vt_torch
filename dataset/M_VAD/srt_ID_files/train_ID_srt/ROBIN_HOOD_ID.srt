ROBIN_HOOD_DVS16
00:02:51,00 --> 00:02:55,50
The thieves hustle out. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS17
00:02:53,00 --> 00:02:58,50
SOMEONE leads SOMEONE and SOMEONE toward the distant 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS18
00:03:01,00 --> 00:03:05,50
SOMEONE<Richard> hands her an arrow. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS19
00:03:03,00 --> 00:03:08,50
As the youngster keeps watch as his cohorts escape. Then, leans back and fires.  

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS20
00:03:08,00 --> 00:03:15,50
The flaming arrow arcs through the air and lands. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS22
00:03:21,00 --> 00:03:26,50
He defiantly tips his head back, then runs out the gate.  

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS23
00:03:25,00 --> 00:03:35,50
SOMEONE<Marion> halts by the barn. Her statuesque features, sullen. Inside, grain spills from a dangling punctured sack. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS25
00:03:44,00 --> 00:03:58,50
Now, light flickers on another calligraphy parchment. King SOMEONE<Richard> the Lion Heart, bankrupt of wealth and glory, is floundering his way back to England after ten years on his crusade. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS27
00:04:19,00 --> 00:04:24,50
In slow motion, he fires. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS28
00:04:21,00 --> 00:04:30,50
tears toward us in a burst of dust. A title. SOMEONE<Robin> Hood. The man lowers the bow. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS29
00:04:30,00 --> 00:04:45,50
Now, three hooded archers tromp out of a green forest. They tote small game bundled upside down on strings. The archer in the lead, a strapping man with an unshaven jaw, hikes them across a muddy road. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS30
00:04:44,00 --> 00:04:49,50
A military camp, 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS31
00:04:47,00 --> 00:05:01,50
The third archer hails distant horsemen. Beyond the encampments stands a stone fortress. Words appear. Chalice Castle, France, 1199 A. D. Now, with his hood pulled off his 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS35
00:06:08,00 --> 00:06:13,50
galloped toward the castle. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS36
00:07:27,00 --> 00:07:31,50
the defender aims across 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS37
00:07:33,00 --> 00:07:37,50
SOMEONE<Robin> and SOMEONE<Jimmy> hop off the gate. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS38
00:08:36,00 --> 00:08:44,50
SOMEONE<Robin> walks off with his arm around SOMEONE<Jimmy>. Now, at another castle, words appear. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS39
00:08:42,00 --> 00:08:46,50
Tower of London. Royal Palace. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS40
00:08:45,00 --> 00:08:51,50
Regal middle aged woman wearing a wimple strides down a hallway. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS41
00:08:51,00 --> 00:09:00,50
She passes a string of rosary beads to a hand maid. She confronts an apple cheeked young woman in an elegant gown listening at 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS42
00:09:15,00 --> 00:09:20,50
The regal woman bursts into the room. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS43
00:09:18,00 --> 00:09:23,50
She yanks back the writhing sheets on the bed. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS44
00:09:41,00 --> 00:09:44,50
Titles. Alas, it's done. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS45
00:09:52,00 --> 00:09:57,50
She pulls the sheet over the girl's face. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS46
00:10:09,00 --> 00:10:14,50
mistress dons the sheet again. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS47
00:11:12,00 --> 00:11:17,50
SOMEONE<Eleanor> looks away uncomfortably. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS48
00:11:16,00 --> 00:11:22,50
Wrapped in the sheet, the mistress sits in SOMEONE's<John's> lap. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS49
00:12:03,00 --> 00:12:07,50
In the king's tent. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS50
00:13:26,00 --> 00:13:31,50
one of three cups and swirls them around each other on a board. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS51
00:14:01,00 --> 00:14:07,50
SOMEONE<Robin> reaches for the cups, but the man stops him. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS52
00:14:12,00 --> 00:14:17,50
then whips off the first cup. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS53
00:14:16,00 --> 00:14:22,50
Eyeing SOMEONE<Robin>, he yanks up another cup. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS54
00:14:20,00 --> 00:14:27,50
The brawny man stares at the archer tauntingly then, lifts the middle cup. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS55
00:15:22,00 --> 00:15:27,50
SOMEONE<Robin> hesitantly lifts his gaze. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS56
00:15:49,00 --> 00:15:58,50
SOMEONE's<Robin's> friends stand. They kneel again as SOMEONE<Robin> and his opponent get to their feet. SOMEONE<Richard> faces the archer. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS57
00:16:14,00 --> 00:16:25,50
SOMEONE<Robin> winces, squeezing his eyes shut, then lifts his head. As his brawny opponent stares at the ground, SOMEONE<Robin> locks gazes with the monarch. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS58
00:17:09,00 --> 00:17:15,50
As the king steps closer, SOMEONE<Robin> bows his head. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS59
00:17:26,00 --> 00:17:31,50
Morning. SOMEONE<Robin> and his three cohorts sit and

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS60
00:17:48,00 --> 00:17:53,50
there at the castle on the adjacent hill as the English army 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS61
00:17:51,00 --> 00:17:57,50
Now, a lone horseman races through the 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS62
00:17:58,00 --> 00:18:02,50
As the rider reaches a camp 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS63
00:18:02,00 --> 00:18:10,50
Banks of the Seine, France. He dismounts. An imposing man with a closely trimmed beard greets him. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS64
00:18:10,00 --> 00:18:23,50
The rider turns over his sword. His dark, deep set eyes gazing from his helmet. On the river bank, a cooks serves oysters and wine to a man in a black and gold tunic. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS65
00:18:22,00 --> 00:18:30,50
The imposing man presents SOMEONE<Godfrey> who lowers his hood to reveal a bald head and raven like features. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS66
00:18:28,00 --> 00:18:33,50
Philip of France. The king beckons. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS67
00:18:33,00 --> 00:18:40,50
Keeping his watchful gaze fixed on Philip, SOMEONE<Godfrey> approaches and sits beside him. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS68
00:18:43,00 --> 00:18:49,50
In English, please. Philip slurps down an oyster. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS69
00:19:44,00 --> 00:19:48,50
He pries at it with a knife. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS70
00:19:47,00 --> 00:19:51,50
Blood stains the oyster. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS71
00:19:51,00 --> 00:19:57,50
He offers the bloody oyster to SOMEONE<Godfrey> who takes it. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS72
00:19:57,00 --> 00:20:02,50
He eyes the pearly and crimson flesh. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS74
00:20:04,00 --> 00:20:08,50
SOMEONE eats the oyster 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS75
00:20:23,00 --> 00:20:28,50
iThere s fire from below and he ducks behind a parapet 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS76
00:20:34,00 --> 00:20:38,50
crossbow and aims. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS78
00:21:06,00 --> 00:21:12,50
Across the way SOMEONE<Jimmy> sees them. A physician arrives. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS79
00:21:11,00 --> 00:21:21,50
wine skin and passes is to SOMEONE<Loxley>. The loyal knight puts it to the wounded king's lips and pours the liquid into his mouth. SOMEONE<Richard> gulps it down. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS80
00:21:23,00 --> 00:21:34,50
SOMEONE<Loxley> mournfully bows his head. SOMEONE<Jimmy> stares slack jawed, then turns and breaks into a run. He dashes towards the stocks. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS81
00:21:45,00 --> 00:21:50,50
SOMEONE<Jimmy> hammers pegs out of the stocks, freeing the man. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS82
00:22:22,00 --> 00:22:28,50
Tucked among the trees follows the group. Words appear. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS84
00:23:05,00 --> 00:23:11,50
that his sword lodged at the end of its wired wrapped hilt, an octagonal belongings. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS85
00:23:19,00 --> 00:23:22,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> ducks. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS86
00:23:22,00 --> 00:23:27,50
The imposing Frenchman joins him. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS87
00:23:31,00 --> 00:23:36,50
A man nods and steps away. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS88
00:23:35,00 --> 00:23:42,50
moves along the looting men. One takes a golden emerald ring from a victim's finger. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS89
00:23:46,00 --> 00:23:56,50
He flips aside a crusader's chain mail hood, but finds an unfamiliar face. Now, SOMEONE<Godfrey> finds SOMEONE<Loxley> gripping the spear in his own gut. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS90
00:24:05,00 --> 00:24:09,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> grips the spear shaft. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS92
00:24:19,00 --> 00:24:24,50
his gaze to the restless white horse. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS93
00:24:28,00 --> 00:24:33,50
A grizzled man finds it, but the animal flees 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS94
00:24:37,00 --> 00:24:41,50
he grabs SOMEONE's<Godfrey's> ankle. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS95
00:24:50,00 --> 00:24:55,50
He spits at SOMEONE's<Godfrey's> feet. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS96
00:24:52,00 --> 00:25:00,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE<Robin> leads his companions through the woods. They each carry camp supplies. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS97
00:24:58,00 --> 00:25:07,50
men carry long bows. As they reach a path, they king's horse approaches at a full gallop. SOMEONE<Robin> steps out before it. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS98
00:25:32,00 --> 00:25:36,50
But the Frenchman rides out 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS99
00:25:34,00 --> 00:25:40,50
SOMEONE<Robin> sets off in fast pursuit, leading his peers along a winding trail. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS100
00:25:39,00 --> 00:25:45,50
sight where the Frenchmen busily loot their victims. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS101
00:25:51,00 --> 00:26:01,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> turns. In the woods, SOMEONE<Robin> and his men creep halfway down the hill. They draw their bows and fire, killing a number of looters. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS102
00:26:01,00 --> 00:26:05,50
SOMEONE flees, urging his goateed 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS103
00:26:22,00 --> 00:26:27,50
over his shoulder and the arrow grazes his cheek. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS104
00:26:28,00 --> 00:26:40,50
the carnage. The red haired archer finds a knight's purse empty, then salvages a small cup. A few feet uphill, the brawny man checks on SOMEONE<Jimmy>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS105
00:26:51,00 --> 00:27:02,50
SOMEONE<Robin> follows the faint cry to SOMEONE<Loxley>, clutching the spear pinning him to the ground. The knight's chest heaves and a few coins lies scattered beside him. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS106
00:27:01,00 --> 00:27:13,50
as SOMEONE<Robin> plucks the nearby sword from the ground. Kneeling, he lays it on SOMEONE's<Loxley's> chest as his companions look on. The bright sun halos SOMEONE<Robin> as he regards the knight. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS107
00:27:35,00 --> 00:27:40,50
unnoticed SOMEONE's<Richard's> horse returning. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS108
00:28:13,00 --> 00:28:19,50
SOMEONE<Robin> frowns to himself and swallows hard. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS109
00:28:19,00 --> 00:28:27,50
SOMEONE<Loxley> turns his face skyward. His eyes widen. His blood stained lips quivering. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS110
00:28:25,00 --> 00:28:31,50
The knight's jaw goes slack and his eyes half close. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS111
00:28:29,00 --> 00:28:41,50
SOMEONE<Robin> tightens his jaw. Reaching down, he gently closes SOMEONE's<Loxley's> eyes. He makes the sign of the cross, then notices a spot of blood at the center of his palm. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS112
00:28:46,00 --> 00:28:56,50
SOMEONE<Robin> notices a small rectangular case hanging from SOMEONE's<Loxley's> shoulder. He opens it. shakes out a folded piece of parchment and unfolds 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS113
00:28:55,00 --> 00:29:04,50
map of western of France with a red line stretching between its northern and south western coasts. SOMEONE<Robin> stands staring at it thoughtfully. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS114
00:29:07,00 --> 00:29:16,50
By the king's horse, SOMEONE<Will> holds the crown aloft. He sets it on his head with a grin. It covers his eyes. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS115
00:29:17,00 --> 00:29:22,50
SOMEONE<Robin> faces each of his companions. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS116
00:30:11,00 --> 00:30:19,50
Later, at the head of a fresh grave, a simple wooden cross stands marked with a J. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS117
00:30:23,00 --> 00:30:37,50
Other shallow graves dot the hill. As his companions step away, SOMEONE<Robin> sets a helmet by SOMEONE's<Jimmy's> grave. Now, as a rider approaches a humble country chapel, a word appears - Nottingham. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS118
00:30:36,00 --> 00:30:42,50
Friar turns as SOMEONE<Marion> arrives and faces a second clergyman. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS119
00:31:03,00 --> 00:31:12,50
With a subtle glare, she leaves the preacher. Upon her approach, the friar humbly bows his round jowly head. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS120
00:31:19,00 --> 00:31:25,50
Sitting on a bench, SOMEONE<Marion> holds him in an appraising gaze. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS121
00:31:59,00 --> 00:32:05,50
Marching toward the exit, SOMEONE<Marion> pauses by Father SOMEONE<Tancred>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS122
00:32:05,00 --> 00:32:11,50
proceeds to the heavy door and yanks it open. Glancing back 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS123
00:32:10,00 --> 00:32:23,50
Father SOMEONE and SOMEONE follow her out. As she mounts a dark horse, the father gazes wearily at her. Behind him, SOMEONE watches with an admiring smile as she rides away. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS124
00:32:26,00 --> 00:32:31,50
He eyes a bug flying near his face. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS125
00:32:34,00 --> 00:32:41,50
A cart sits loaded with straw beehives. SOMEONE<Tancred> frowns quizzically. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS126
00:32:46,00 --> 00:32:54,50
encampments set in view of a ship at the water's edge. A man on board spies their approach. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS127
00:32:54,00 --> 00:33:00,50
man with wind tousled curls strides up to the edge of the deck and watches the approaching 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS134
00:34:57,00 --> 00:35:05,50
SOMEONE<Robin> frowns. In a hazy flashback, a tow headed boy runs into a crowd. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS135
00:35:04,00 --> 00:35:15,50
As two more force a man to his knees. On the ship, SOMEONE<Robin> plants the SOMEONE<Loxley> sword downward. He remembers a soldier carrying the boy away, then 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS136
00:35:20,00 --> 00:35:27,50
reflects sunlight. Words appear - the Tempts Estuary, England. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS137
00:35:29,00 --> 00:35:34,50
In the ship, light seeps between the deck on SOMEONE 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS138
00:35:32,00 --> 00:35:38,50
who sleeps below with his arms wrapped around his sword. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS139
00:35:36,00 --> 00:35:45,50
Rubbing his eyes, he sees SOMEONE<Will> and SOMEONE<Allan> asleep on the floor nearby. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS140
00:35:43,00 --> 00:35:47,50
his mouth opened as he sleeps. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS141
00:35:46,00 --> 00:35:51,50
SOMEONE<Robin> rises and peers outside. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS142
00:35:56,00 --> 00:36:02,50
SOMEONE<Robin> hurriedly heads back into the cabin and wakes his sleeping friends. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS143
00:36:28,00 --> 00:36:39,50
Now, in the royal palace, Queen SOMEONE<Eleanor> strides to a pair of SOMEONE<Norman> windows in a stone alcove. She sees the approaching ship. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS144
00:36:38,00 --> 00:36:42,50
She turns to a servant. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS145
00:36:42,00 --> 00:36:49,50
The servant curtsies and heads off. Queen SOMEONE<Eleanor> steps away from the windows. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS146
00:37:09,00 --> 00:37:12,50
They bow as the queen approach. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS147
00:37:33,00 --> 00:37:39,50
A band master holds up his hand and four drummers stop.  

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS148
00:37:44,00 --> 00:37:47,50
He heads toward the queen. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS150
00:37:59,00 --> 00:38:05,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> steps into the light and swaps a look with his goateed comrade. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS151
00:38:05,00 --> 00:38:12,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> works his jaw. Back at the dock, SOMEONE<Robin> draws nearer

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS152
00:38:10,00 --> 00:38:17,50
Reaching her, he drops to one knee and holds out the covered crown. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS153
00:38:16,00 --> 00:38:35,50
the red and gold flag, Queen SOMEONE<Eleanor> finds SOMEONE's<Richard's> helmet underneath ringed by the English crown. Prince SOMEONE's<John's> lips part as he eyes it. His mother stutters. SOMEONE's<John's> French mistress averts her gaze and reaches for the prince's hand. She squeezes it. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS154
00:38:33,00 --> 00:38:41,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> and his comrade join the crowd and see the queen holding the fallen monarch's battle crown. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS155
00:38:42,00 --> 00:38:51,50
Prince SOMEONE<John> drops to one knee and prayerfully folds his hands. His mother sets the helmet upon his head. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS156
00:38:53,00 --> 00:38:59,50
SOMEONE<John> glances heavily at SOMEONE<Robin>, then stands. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS157
00:39:14,00 --> 00:39:20,50
the crowd obeys. He faces SOMEONE<Robin> whose head remains bowed. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS158
00:39:19,00 --> 00:39:23,50
SOMEONE<Robin> lifts his head slightly. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS159
00:39:30,00 --> 00:39:35,50
SOMEONE<Robin> briefly meets his gaze. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS160
00:39:42,00 --> 00:39:47,50
SOMEONE<John>, SOMEONE<Will> and SOMEONE<Allan> subtly head off. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS161
00:39:45,00 --> 00:39:55,50
King SOMEONE<John> removes one of his rings and holds it up. SOMEONE<Robin> drops on to one knee. SOMEONE<John> offers the ring, then retracts it. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS162
00:39:56,00 --> 00:40:02,50
SOMEONE<Robin> looks up uneasily. King SOMEONE<John> blinks. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS163
00:40:05,00 --> 00:40:09,50
He taps the ring on his helmet. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS164
00:40:16,00 --> 00:40:21,50
He slides the ring back on his finger. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS165
00:40:19,00 --> 00:40:24,50
SOMEONE<John> takes his mistress's hand. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS166
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:33,50
The crowd parts for the king and SOMEONE<Robin> withdraws. King SOMEONE<John> spots SOMEONE<Godfrey>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS167
00:40:37,00 --> 00:40:42,50
The scar at the corner of SOMEONE's<Godfrey's> mouth. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS168
00:40:53,00 --> 00:41:00,50
SOMEONE<John> takes his mistress's hand. He eyes SOMEONE's<Godfrey's> comrade as they pass. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS169
00:40:59,00 --> 00:41:06,50
The goateed man stands. He and SOMEONE<Godfrey> watch as the procession heads off. SOMEONE<He>

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS170
00:41:09,00 --> 00:41:15,50
SOMEONE<Robin> finds the bearded wavy haired nobleman addressing him and steps closer. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS171
00:41:25,00 --> 00:41:30,50
SOMEONE<Robin> shakes his hand. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS172
00:41:32,00 --> 00:41:37,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> narrows his eyes. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS173
00:41:37,00 --> 00:41:44,50
He meets his goateed comrade's gaze. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS174
00:41:41,00 --> 00:41:50,50
The man nods and heads off. SOMEONE<Godfrey> glares at SOMEONE<Robin>, then turns away. Later, SOMEONE<Robin> rides

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS175
00:42:08,00 --> 00:42:14,50
Now, in the lush green fields of Nottingham, Lady SOMEONE 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS176
00:42:12,00 --> 00:42:17,50
farmer leading a horse and plow. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS177
00:42:30,00 --> 00:42:35,50
Taking the Clydesdale's bridle,  

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS179
00:42:52,00 --> 00:42:58,50
The Sheriff parallels SOMEONE<Marion> as she plows. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS180
00:43:28,00 --> 00:43:32,50
He yanks SOMEONE close 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS181
00:43:38,00 --> 00:43:42,50
He kisses her, but she bites him. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS182
00:43:42,00 --> 00:43:46,50
She spits. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS183
00:44:11,00 --> 00:44:18,50
The sheriff rides off and two other men on horseback follow. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS184
00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:22,50
Lady SOMEONE<Marion> nervously covers her mouth. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS185
00:44:26,00 --> 00:44:33,50
She turns toward the forest and sees a group of bare chested boys running away. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS187
00:44:43,00 --> 00:44:47,50
Kneeling at ground. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS188
00:44:46,00 --> 00:44:51,50
SOMEONE<Robin> counts coins. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS189
00:45:21,00 --> 00:45:26,50
SOMEONE<Robin> solemnly faces his friends. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS190
00:45:58,00 --> 00:46:04,50
He shifts his gaze to the other men, then turns back to SOMEONE. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS191
00:46:08,00 --> 00:46:13,50
Daytime. At the royal palace. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS192
00:46:21,00 --> 00:46:27,50
SOMEONE<John> takes the French woman's hand. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS193
00:46:34,00 --> 00:46:38,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> looks on. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS194
00:46:36,00 --> 00:46:41,50
King SOMEONE<John> rises from his throne. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS195
00:46:40,00 --> 00:46:49,50
He waves off his courtiers who bow and hurry out leaving the Royal family, SOMEONE<Godfrey>, SOMEONE<Marshal> and one other chancellor. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS196
00:46:47,00 --> 00:46:53,50
his crown, hangs it at the back of his throne and sits. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS197
00:47:30,00 --> 00:47:36,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> moves from his place beside the king's throne. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS198
00:47:34,00 --> 00:47:43,50
Queen SOMEONE<Eleanor> watches as the bald man strolls to the center of the room. SOMEONE<Marshal> furrows his brow. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS199
00:47:41,00 --> 00:47:47,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> gives him a look, then faces King SOMEONE<John>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS200
00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:13,50
SOMEONE<Marshal> stares. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS201
00:48:47,00 --> 00:49:02,50
The queen slaps his face. Grabbing his cheek, King SOMEONE<John> stumbles. Queen SOMEONE<Eleanor> storms out. SOMEONE's<John's> mistress eyes her as she leaves, then turns her haughty gaze to her husband. The king brushes his cheek. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS202
00:49:02,00 --> 00:49:11,50
He glances at SOMEONE<Godfrey>. As he steps toward SOMEONE<Marshal>, he rubs his cheek again with the back of his hand. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS203
00:49:11,00 --> 00:49:19,50
A man in a white mantle and coif joins them. King SOMEONE<John> gives SOMEONE<Marshal> a patronizing look. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS204
00:49:40,00 --> 00:49:45,50
The white robed official extends a hand. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS205
00:49:44,00 --> 00:49:55,50
SOMEONE<Marshal> slides an oval ring from his finger and sets it in the chancellor's palm. He frowns at King SOMEONE<John> who dismisses him. SOMEONE<Marshal> bows. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS206
00:49:54,00 --> 00:50:09,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> watches with a smirk. Straightening, SOMEONE<Marshal> glances at him, then strides off. SOMEONE<John> takes the ring from the chancellor. He tosses it in the air as he turns to his bald friend. Later, SOMEONE<Godfrey> heads down a corridor. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS207
00:50:08,00 --> 00:50:14,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> catches up. SOMEONE<Marshal> spreads his arms wide. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS208
00:50:16,00 --> 00:50:23,50
He lowers his arm arms and turns partway to the conspirator watching him from the corner 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS209
00:50:22,00 --> 00:50:27,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> strolls pass SOMEONE<Marshal>, then faces him. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS210
00:50:28,00 --> 00:50:43,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> shifts his weight and extends his arm showing SOMEONE<Marshal> the oval ring in his hand. He lifts his brow arrogantly, then continues down the corridor. As he heads away, he spreads his arms imitating SOMEONE<Marshal>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS211
00:50:53,00 --> 00:50:57,50
SOMEONE<scar> faced soldier. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS213
00:51:14,00 --> 00:51:20,50
green forest, SOMEONE<Robin> and his men ride their horses along a path. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS214
00:51:35,00 --> 00:51:39,50
He sees more boys running through the trees. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS216
00:51:40,00 --> 00:51:44,50
They arrive onto a grassy hillside. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS217
00:51:47,00 --> 00:51:52,50
as they arrive at the village of modest straw roofed huts 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS218
00:51:56,00 --> 00:52:00,50
SOMEONE's dome shaped hive sit on 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS219
00:52:02,00 --> 00:52:06,50
SOMEONE<Will> dismounts. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS220
00:52:19,00 --> 00:52:23,50
just a few copulating thrusts 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS221
00:52:43,00 --> 00:52:47,50
SOMEONE<Robin> glances up a hill. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS222
00:52:46,00 --> 00:52:53,50
Holding SOMEONE's<Loxley's> sword, SOMEONE<Robin> shifts his eyes thoughtfully, then gives a nod. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS223
00:52:55,00 --> 00:52:59,50
SOMEONE<Will> gapes after him. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS224
00:52:59,00 --> 00:53:04,50
away from his face as he watches SOMEONE<Robin> leave. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS225
00:53:04,00 --> 00:53:08,50
SOMEONE<John> docks another bee. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS226
00:53:26,00 --> 00:53:31,50
The men pay SOMEONE<Friar>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS227
00:53:35,00 --> 00:53:41,50
heads up the hillside through the remnants of the stone archway. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS228
00:53:38,00 --> 00:53:42,50
As he gallops down a dirt 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS229
00:53:42,00 --> 00:53:48,50
loaded with straw. He rides through an entryway and a stone 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS230
00:53:48,00 --> 00:53:53,50
Two geese shuffle away from him. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS231
00:53:51,00 --> 00:53:55,50
SOMEONE<smith> hammering out. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS232
00:53:53,00 --> 00:53:57,50
SOMEONE<a> stops behind SOMEONE<Marion>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS233
00:53:57,00 --> 00:54:01,50
staring down at her. SOMEONE<a>

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS234
00:54:07,00 --> 00:54:14,50
SOMEONE<Marion> looks over her shoulder, appraises SOMEONE<Robin>, then resumes her work. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS235
00:54:22,00 --> 00:54:26,50
SOMEONE<Marion> gets to her feet. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS236
00:54:33,00 --> 00:54:38,50
As he dismounts and faces her. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS237
00:54:42,00 --> 00:54:46,50
SOMEONE<Marion> averts her gaze. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS238
00:54:45,00 --> 00:54:56,50
She quickly turns her back to him. With a stoic expression, SOMEONE<Marion> leads SOMEONE<Robin> through a gate into the castle courtyard. She stumbles and her face falters. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS239
00:54:56,00 --> 00:55:01,50
She catches herself and rubs her chest. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS240
00:54:59,00 --> 00:55:04,50
Now, they enter a stable area. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS241
00:55:02,00 --> 00:55:07,50
SOMEONE<Marion> gestures to a servant. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS242
00:55:08,00 --> 00:55:18,50
SOMEONE<Robin> hands over the white horse's reins, then unfastens SOMEONE's<Loxley's> sword from its saddle. SOMEONE<Marion> removes her shoes and sets them on a

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS243
00:55:16,00 --> 00:55:20,50
Her shoulders heave. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS244
00:55:34,00 --> 00:55:44,50
SOMEONE<Margaret> pours water into a shallow pan. SOMEONE<Marion> takes a seat and washes her feet, glancing uncomfortably at the archer. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS245
00:55:48,00 --> 00:55:52,50
summoning a breath. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS246
00:56:12,00 --> 00:56:17,50
His lips stuttering hesitantly. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS247
00:56:26,00 --> 00:56:33,50
a door to a stone colonnade, then faces the archer sternly. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS248
00:56:54,00 --> 00:56:58,50
hunter's jaw hangs slack. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS249
00:57:06,00 --> 00:57:15,50
his hand around the hilt of SOMEONE's<Loxley's> sword. SOMEONE<Walter> draws it halfway from its sheath, his eyes gazing off tearfully. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS250
00:57:36,00 --> 00:57:45,50
The aging nobleman hobbles to his daughter-in-law, cradles her head and tenderly presses his lips to her temple. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS251
00:58:06,00 --> 00:58:22,50
and SOMEONE<Robin> treads toward him. SOMEONE's<Walter's> fingers find the archer's neck, then face. He sweeps one hand down SOMEONE's<Robin's> forehead, then touches his brow with both thumbs. His fingers drift appraisingly down the visitor's temples. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS252
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:48,50
Later, in a bath chamber, steam rises from a large vat. Two maids bustle out leaving SOMEONE<Marion> and SOMEONE<Robin> alone. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS253
00:58:51,00 --> 00:58:55,50
She halts in the doorway. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS254
00:59:02,00 --> 00:59:06,50
She turns back to SOMEONE<Robin> at the door. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS255
00:59:05,00 --> 00:59:11,50
Her gaze darts as she arches her brow, affecting an air of indifference. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS256
00:59:16,00 --> 00:59:25,50
The archer stands stiff as she unbuttons a clasp at this throat. She lays the ends of the chain mail hood on his shoulders. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS257
00:59:29,00 --> 00:59:53,50
She obediently removes the cape like garment and sets it down, then yanks out the lacings of his tunic setting it aside as well. She works on his chain mail sleeve. SOMEONE<Robin> watches tenderly. Later, he bends at the waist and worms his way out of the mail hauberk. SOMEONE<Marion> crouches, tugging it off over his head, then falls on her rear when it finally drops to the floor. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS258
00:59:51,00 --> 01:00:06,50
wearily gets up and unlaces the back of his long tunic. Now, she works it off of him as he bends over. Freed from the garment, he straightens and faces her bare chested. His burly pecs heave beneath his broad shoulders. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS259
01:00:07,00 --> 01:00:11,50
Brushing past him, she strides 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS260
01:00:10,00 --> 01:00:19,50
The widow give SOMEONE<Robin> a final glance before heading out. The archer rinses his hands and face, then beams. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS261
01:00:17,00 --> 01:00:26,50
laces his boot. Now, servants hurry out of the kitchen carrying bowls of food into the banquet hall. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS262
01:00:27,00 --> 01:00:34,50
SOMEONE<Marion> fetches the wine in a pitcher of water. At the table, SOMEONE<Robin> sits with SOMEONE<Walter>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS263
01:00:49,00 --> 01:00:53,50
SOMEONE<Marion> waters down SOMEONE's<Walter's> wine. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS264
01:01:14,00 --> 01:01:20,50
She studies SOMEONE<Robin> from across the table. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS265
01:01:41,00 --> 01:01:45,50
averts her eyes from the archers gaze. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS266
01:01:55,00 --> 01:02:04,50
SOMEONE<Walter> obliviously sips his watered down wine. SOMEONE<Robin> watches, then glances at SOMEONE<Marion> and leans back in his chair. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS267
01:04:31,00 --> 01:04:35,50
The shore. From several tall arch shaped 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS268
01:04:41,00 --> 01:04:46,50
spy peeks out at them. He watches stoically 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS269
01:04:49,00 --> 01:04:57,50
backs away and crouches at a wooden cage. He opens a hatch on top, then reaches inside. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS270
01:04:56,00 --> 01:04:59,50
He pulls out a pigeon. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS271
01:05:02,00 --> 01:05:09,50
into a slender pouch on the birds leg and releases it. It flaps away into the night. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS272
01:05:13,00 --> 01:05:20,50
He entered the kitchen and SOMEONE<Marion> closes the door on them. In the banquet hall, a wolf hound 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS273
01:05:19,00 --> 01:05:28,50
blazing fire on the hearth, SOMEONE<Robin> sheaths his sword as SOMEONE<Marion> approaches. She folds her hands at her waist. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS274
01:05:47,00 --> 01:05:54,50
She trumps off toward a stairwell. Lounging in a chair, SOMEONE<Robin> watches her go. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS275
01:06:01,00 --> 01:06:09,50
Her lips part irritably. She strides to the center of the room to address him. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS276
01:06:11,00 --> 01:06:17,50
She gives a mocking curtsy, then storms off, shoving her fingers in her mouth. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS277
01:06:19,00 --> 01:06:24,50
ahead of her, she trots upstairs with her skirts hiked up. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS278
01:06:23,00 --> 01:06:47,50
inscrutably then glances at the fire and bites his lower lip. He picks up SOMEONE's<Loxley's> sword and eyes the inscription on the hilt - until lambs become lions. Later, he treads into SOMEONE's<Marion's> bed chamber. Warm light flickers on a hefty four poster bed. Curtains separate it from a sitting area in front of a fireplace where SOMEONE<Marion> tosses bedding to the floor and eyes the archer haughtily. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS279
01:06:46,00 --> 01:06:53,50
She gestures at the bedding, then strides to the curtains toward her bed. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS280
01:06:59,00 --> 01:07:06,50
She whips the curtains shut and SOMEONE<Robin> plods over to the bedding with the dogs. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS281
01:07:05,00 --> 01:07:09,50
SOMEONE<Marion> lights a candle. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS282
01:07:07,00 --> 01:07:41,50
SOMEONE<Robin> glances at the curtains. Back lit by the candle, the sheer fabric offers a thinly veiled view of SOMEONE<Marion> stepping out of her dress. SOMEONE<Robin> lies down in front of the fire and pets a wolf hound lying next to him. Resting his head on his hand, he looks to the curtain. SOMEONE's<Marion's> silhouette pulls another layer off over her head, leaving her clad only in her chamois. SOMEONE<Robin> politely rolls onto his back and looks away. Now, the bare branches of towering trees sway against the sky. SOMEONE<Godfrey> leaves a camp and prowls into the misty woods. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS283
01:07:46,00 --> 01:07:57,50
A figure rises from the darkness. Moonlight gleaming on his conical helm. He and SOMEONE<Godfrey> hike the short distance toward each other. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS285
01:08:02,00 --> 01:08:18,50
The Frenchman smirks and steps to SOMEONE's<Godfrey's> side and gestures toward the forest.  

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS286
01:08:17,00 --> 01:08:22,50
Dozens of armed French soldiers appear in the mist and head toward them. Daytime. In a dove cote, a shaggy bird keeper, as they flutter away, he seizes one. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS287
01:08:25,00 --> 01:08:31,50
and the aid plucks the tiny scroll from the pouch on its leg. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS288
01:08:29,00 --> 01:08:41,50
SOMEONE<Marshal> carefully unrolls the scroll as the aid looks on behind him. The noble man raises a magnifying lens and reads news of the French soldiers landing. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS289
01:09:04,00 --> 01:09:09,50
Meanwhile, at SOMEONE castle, SOMEONE 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS290
01:09:52,00 --> 01:09:56,50
SOMEONE<Robin> grabs SOMEONE's<Loxley's> sword. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS291
01:09:55,00 --> 01:10:01,50
with a wry huff. Later, SOMEONE<Robin> rides the king's white steed. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS292
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:06,50
hair billowing behind her. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS293
01:10:09,00 --> 01:10:14,50
horses at a cross roads between fields. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS294
01:10:56,00 --> 01:11:00,50
ride past the man at a market stall. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS295
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:13,50
A woman joins them. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS296
01:11:15,00 --> 01:11:22,50
SOMEONE<Robin> nods and glances uncomfortably at SOMEONE<Marion> as they ride on. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS297
01:11:25,00 --> 01:11:32,50
SOMEONE<Robin> notices SOMEONE<Allan>, SOMEONE<Will> and Little SOMEONE<John> bathing at a trough. SOMEONE<John> splashes

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS298
01:11:32,00 --> 01:11:37,50
SOMEONE<Robin> trots over to them ahead of SOMEONE<Marion>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS299
01:11:52,00 --> 01:12:01,50
The tall woman and two of the dancing beauties emerge from doorways nearby. Noticing SOMEONE<Marion>, they quickly retreat. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS300
01:12:04,00 --> 01:12:10,50
She smirks at SOMEONE<Robin> and rides off. He wears a bashful smile. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS301
01:12:26,00 --> 01:12:32,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE ride up to the church where men load sacks 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS302
01:13:07,00 --> 01:13:15,50
A rat faced deacon nearby glares at SOMEONE<Marion> as he sips from a tin mug. SOMEONE<Robin> leans into Tuck. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS303
01:13:51,00 --> 01:13:57,50
A slow smile spreads across SOMEONE's pudgy cheeks. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS304
01:13:55,00 --> 01:13:59,50
SOMEONE<Robin> and SOMEONE<Marion> ride off. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS305
01:14:00,00 --> 01:14:19,50
Later, in his living quarters, SOMEONE pours a cup of mead. From a copper pot standing over an open flame, he lifts away a stick tied with mulling sacks and gives his concoction a stir. SOMEONE<Robin> enters, sets down a bucket near several sleeping men and ambles over to Tuck, who hands him a cup. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS306
01:14:21,00 --> 01:14:26,50
They each take a swig of the friar's concoction. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS307
01:14:28,00 --> 01:14:33,50
They tap cups and finish their drinks. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS308
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:42,50
SOMEONE<Robin> strides back to his bucket, picks it up and splashes water in the sleeping men. They bolt upright. It's SOMEONE<Will>, Little SOMEONE<John> and SOMEONE<Allan>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS310
01:14:48,00 --> 01:14:55,50
Now, at twilight, carts of grain make their way along a narrow road through the woods. Several guards 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS311
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:04,50
upon a hooded figure with a long bow. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS312
01:15:36,00 --> 01:15:40,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> also emerged. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS313
01:15:42,00 --> 01:15:46,50
Hanging from a tree, SOMEONE 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS314
01:16:00,00 --> 01:16:04,50
Merry Men ride off with the grain. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS315
01:16:08,00 --> 01:16:27,50
shuffle along with tiny steps. Now, puffy clouds reflect the moonlight, casting a gentle glow on Nottingham's fields as the Merry Men plot to reclaim the grain. In slow motion, SOMEONE<Robin> marches down a row of furrowed soil, tossing seed by the handful from a sack slung over his shoulder. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS316
01:16:24,00 --> 01:16:34,50
other patch of soil, SOMEONE<Will> drizzles grain from his fingertips. Little SOMEONE works beside SOMEONE who wears a joyful grin. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS317
01:16:32,00 --> 01:16:43,50
turning on the spot as rain begins to fall upon the fields. It starts gently, then quickly gathers force as lightning flashes overhead. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS318
01:16:43,00 --> 01:16:59,50
SOMEONE<Marion> sits by the hearth in the banquet hall. A fiery glow illuminating her noble features as she gazes downward. At her feet, SOMEONE<Robin> sleeps on the floor in an undershirt, a blanket covering him from the waist down. He wakes. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS319
01:17:15,00 --> 01:17:25,50
She crouches beside SOMEONE<Robin> and draws the blanket up over his shoulder. Under his tender stare, her warm smile fades. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS320
01:17:28,00 --> 01:17:54,50
form silhouetted against the fire. Her gaze lingers on SOMEONE<Robin> as she sidles away. She turns her back to him and strides across the great hall, her arms swinging stiffly at her sides. He watches from the floor as she pauses. Her fair skin resplendent in the glow of a moonlit window. She glances back toward SOMEONE<Robin> with parted lips, then continues out. Now, as legions of soldiers march double time through the woods, 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS322
01:18:28,00 --> 01:18:31,50
archers arrive. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS323
01:19:05,00 --> 01:19:10,50
proclamation on the cross. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS324
01:19:16,00 --> 01:19:23,50
We watch SOMEONE<Godfrey> and his men terrorize. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS327
01:19:57,00 --> 01:20:01,50
On the floor, he rolls onto his back. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS328
01:20:00,00 --> 01:20:08,50
dropping an iron chandelier on him. Now, SOMEONE<Marshal> arrives in a windblown field

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS329
01:20:10,00 --> 01:20:15,50
The Queen Mother turns. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS330
01:20:14,00 --> 01:20:20,50
As SOMEONE<Marshal> joins her, a servant pours water from a kettle. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS331
01:20:36,00 --> 01:20:41,50
She hands of the owl to an attendant. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS332
01:21:28,00 --> 01:21:35,50
Now, SOMEONE's<John's> mistress sits in the light of a blazing fire as SOMEONE<Eleanor> addresses her. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS333
01:22:14,00 --> 01:22:18,50
Later, SOMEONE<Isabella> faces SOMEONE<John>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS334
01:22:27,00 --> 01:22:32,50
He moves in close to her face, seething. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS336
01:22:32,00 --> 01:22:49,50
With glistening eyes, SOMEONE<John> looks down to find SOMEONE<Isabella> holding a dagger to her own heart. He closes his hand over hers and stares into her eyes, taking in her earnest gaze. His face ceases tearfully. The spotless dagger falls to the floor. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS337
01:22:48,00 --> 01:22:57,50
He embraces her. His mouth devouring hers in a passionate kiss. Now, a hooded rider arrives at the edge of Nottingham. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS338
01:22:55,00 --> 01:23:06,50
He pauses briefly, glancing over his shoulder. Later, as he arrives at a blacksmith's forge, a glimpse beneath his hood reveals him as SOMEONE's<Godfrey's> goateed accomplice. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS339
01:23:09,00 --> 01:23:13,50
as a man enters 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS340
01:23:15,00 --> 01:23:21,50
The goateed Frenchman enters glowering from beneath his hood. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS341
01:23:21,00 --> 01:23:42,50
The sheriff's male servants depart, but a crone dressed in black remains at the table. The Frenchman advances, pulling his hood back. He takes out a letter and offers it to the sheriff. The lawman hesitates, then snatches it from his hand. He slices open its wax seals with a knife and unfolds the pages. His brow lifts in shock as he reads. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS342
01:24:11,00 --> 01:24:17,50
The Frenchman glowers. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS343
01:24:37,00 --> 01:24:42,50
SOMEONE<Marion> walk their horses through a village farm. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS345
01:24:57,00 --> 01:25:07,50
As she reaches for her horse, he joins her at her side. He gives her a boost into the saddle, then gently sets her foot in a stirrup. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS346
01:25:07,00 --> 01:25:11,50
SOMEONE<Marion> shyly looks away. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS347
01:25:09,00 --> 01:25:15,50
SOMEONE<Robin> mounts his horse and she leads him onward. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS348
01:25:15,00 --> 01:25:35,50
The mill's large wooden wheel. SOMEONE<Marion> looks over her shoulder to find her companion pausing to take in his surroundings. He meets her gaze and she gives a coy warm smile. SOMEONE<Robin> watches her with a furrowed brow, then rides up to meet her. Now, as SOMEONE<Marshal> trains a horse in a muddy field, words appear. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS349
01:25:51,00 --> 01:25:56,50
SOMEONE's newly trained horse prances past 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS350
01:26:28,00 --> 01:26:32,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE and his men 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS352
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:04,50
From his saddle, SOMEONE<John> leans closer to his adviser. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS353
01:27:28,00 --> 01:27:33,50
distinctive scar on his cheek, joins SOMEONE<Marshal> at his side. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS354
01:27:43,00 --> 01:27:56,50
Now, in a tent, SOMEONE<Godfrey> taps excess water off the dagger and carefully proceeds to shave with it. His goateed comrade approaches and SOMEONE<Godfrey> meets him in the entryway. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS355
01:28:01,00 --> 01:28:09,50
SOMEONE's<Godfrey's> jaw hangs slack. He shifts his cagey eyes and nods resolutely. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS356
01:28:11,00 --> 01:28:18,50
His comrade smiles and heads off. SOMEONE<Godfrey> faces a messenger. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS358
01:28:28,00 --> 01:28:34,50
The messenger stands, gives a slight bow and strides off. SOMEONE<Godfrey>

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS359
01:28:33,00 --> 01:28:39,50
toward his shaving mirror, studying his scarred reflection. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS360
01:28:42,00 --> 01:28:47,50
He put a hot splint to his facial scar. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS361
01:29:08,00 --> 01:29:13,50
The archer pours two mugs. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS362
01:29:12,00 --> 01:29:17,50
Both men drink. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS363
01:29:39,00 --> 01:29:45,50
This is her with a peaceful gaze and she reaches out. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS365
01:30:38,00 --> 01:31:05,50
Now, the orphans of the wood jog through a nearby field. They hide behind a short rise and spy on the village festivities. One dirt smeared adolescent, gripping a pole arm, eyes the village with a jealous longing pout. More armed boys run past. Later, in SOMEONE's<Walter's> bed chamber, two mice forage a table of picked over food. One mouse madly cycles his hind legs to climb up into a footed bowl. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS366
01:31:11,00 --> 01:31:17,50
SOMEONE<Robin> listens, seated at SOMEONE's<Walter's> bedside. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS367
01:31:44,00 --> 01:31:51,50
Father and son make hand prints in wet mortar. SOMEONE<Robin> reads an engraving. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS368
01:32:06,00 --> 01:32:12,50
Stone is laid on the base of a cross at Barnsdale. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS369
01:32:10,00 --> 01:32:15,50
SOMEONE<Longstride> hugs his son SOMEONE<Robin>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS370
01:32:15,00 --> 01:32:19,50
He tosses him in the air. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS371
01:32:23,00 --> 01:32:32,50
SOMEONE<Robin> studies the old man uneasily, then blinks his eyes shut and swallows. The flash back continues. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS372
01:32:32,00 --> 01:32:41,50
Young SOMEONE<Robin> jogs through a crowd. A gloved hand wearing a chain mail sleeves pats his shoulder. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS373
01:32:45,00 --> 01:32:51,50
SOMEONE's<Robin's> father bravely faces the authorities. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS374
01:32:50,00 --> 01:32:59,50
A younger SOMEONE<Walter> gazes solemnly. SOMEONE<Longstride> surrenders his sword to a soldier as two others force him to his knees

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS375
01:33:03,00 --> 01:33:11,50
brings it down. Back in the present, SOMEONE's<Robin's> face ceases tearfully. He hangs his head. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS376
01:33:11,00 --> 01:33:16,50
SOMEONE<Walter> knits his brow sympathetically. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS377
01:33:18,00 --> 01:33:23,50
SOMEONE<Robin> lifts his gaze. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS378
01:33:22,00 --> 01:33:29,50
He holds SOMEONE's<Walter's> hand and rests his brow upon it. Morning in the banquet hall. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS379
01:33:55,00 --> 01:33:59,50
A messenger bows. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS380
01:34:11,00 --> 01:34:16,50
The messenger bows and heads out. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS381
01:34:20,00 --> 01:34:24,50
SOMEONE<Marion> watches from the staircase. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS382
01:34:25,00 --> 01:34:33,50
SOMEONE<Walter> stretches out his arms. SOMEONE<Robin> steps into his embrace and the elderly man pats his back. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS383
01:34:33,00 --> 01:34:37,50
Later, SOMEONE rides up 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS384
01:34:39,00 --> 01:34:44,50
SOMEONE<Robin> smiles his thanks as SOMEONE<Margaret> heads off. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS385
01:34:42,00 --> 01:34:47,50
He turns his white horse and rides away. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS386
01:34:46,00 --> 01:34:57,50
to leaded glass window and gazes out through the diamond shaped panes. SOMEONE<Robin> leads his men out of the courtyard and rides around the corner toward the homestead entryway. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS388
01:36:02,00 --> 01:36:06,50
King SOMEONE<John> arrives. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS389
01:36:09,00 --> 01:36:17,50
King SOMEONE<John> draws his sword halfway from its sheath and offers its hilt to the baron. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS390
01:36:15,00 --> 01:36:19,50
SOMEONE<Baldwin> glares. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS391
01:36:55,00 --> 01:37:10,50
Now, SOMEONE<Robin> rides into the charred ruins at Barnsdale. The intricately carved stone cross stands unharmed in the deserted village center. SOMEONE<Robin> stares at it as he rides closer. The archer dismounts and his men follow suit. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS392
01:37:11,00 --> 01:37:21,50
SOMEONE<Robin> ties his horse to a wooden beam, then treads toward the cross and the stone steps forming its base. He studies it uneasily. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS393
01:37:23,00 --> 01:37:30,50
Dropping his eyes to the ground, he crouches and plants one hand in the mud. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS394
01:37:28,00 --> 01:37:35,50
SOMEONE<Robin> lifts his face.  

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS395
01:37:33,00 --> 01:37:40,50
He remembers his father lifting his face as the soldier bring him to his knees. The archer bows his head, then looks back to the cross. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS396
01:37:40,00 --> 01:37:45,50
He stands and draws his sword. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS397
01:37:45,00 --> 01:37:53,50
With the pummel, he hammers four corners of a stone step set on the octagonal base of the monument. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS398
01:37:55,00 --> 01:38:02,50
SOMEONE<Robin> wedges the blade underneath the stone, levers it upward and leans it back. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS399
01:38:00,00 --> 01:38:17,50
underside bears the engraving. Rise and rise again until lambs become lions. In the border, the archer finds a child sized hand print beside that of a grown man. He slips his hand into his father's print. It fits perfectly. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS400
01:38:15,00 --> 01:38:21,50
He slowly straightens, then sheaths his sword. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS401
01:38:23,00 --> 01:38:29,50
Beside him, SOMEONE<Will> studies the engraving. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS402
01:38:33,00 --> 01:38:37,50
SOMEONE<Robin> strides forward. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS403
01:38:56,00 --> 01:39:03,50
SOMEONE and King SOMEONE see SOMEONE and his men at the back of the assembled town's people 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS404
01:39:55,00 --> 01:40:00,50
The king sneers. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS405
01:41:14,00 --> 01:41:20,50
King SOMEONE<John> winces thoughtfully, then leans toward SOMEONE<Marshal>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS406
01:41:20,00 --> 01:41:25,50
He looks out to the crowd. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS407
01:41:51,00 --> 01:41:55,50
village and people scatter. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS410
01:42:45,00 --> 01:42:49,50
soldier discovers a closet packed of food. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS411
01:43:36,00 --> 01:43:40,50
He shuffles toward the door, gripping a sword 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS412
01:43:39,00 --> 01:43:43,50
He enters the courtyard. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS413
01:43:51,00 --> 01:43:56,50
SOMEONE<Walter> gazes sorrowfully. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS414
01:43:58,00 --> 01:44:08,50
SOMEONE<Godfrey> stalks toward the old man and licks the edge of his grotesque arrow scar. He leans close and gives a taunting smile. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS416
01:44:24,00 --> 01:44:28,50
SOMEONE stabs a legionnaire shield 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS417
01:44:31,00 --> 01:44:36,50
they lock blades. The blind man 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS418
01:44:33,00 --> 01:44:38,50
He knocks SOMEONE down causing the bald thug from behind. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS420
01:44:46,00 --> 01:44:51,50
He collapses face down. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS421
01:45:21,00 --> 01:45:25,50
the man extends his hand. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS422
01:45:24,00 --> 01:45:34,50
Meanwhile, in the woods, the masked boys creep towards the village. The lead boy crouches and watches the legionnaires violently rounding up 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS423
01:45:37,00 --> 01:45:45,50
His eyes peer solemnly from his beastly mask. Now, soldiers shove SOMEONE<Marion> into a building and yank

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS424
01:45:44,00 --> 01:45:47,50
He struggles to open it. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS425
01:45:57,00 --> 01:46:01,50
He fearfully throws it down. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS426
01:46:21,00 --> 01:46:25,50
SOMEONE<Marion> stands in the shadows. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS427
01:46:24,00 --> 01:46:28,50
She edges out. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS428
01:46:31,00 --> 01:46:37,50
sword belt dropped from his waist. SOMEONE<Marion> dashed

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS429
01:46:36,00 --> 01:46:47,50
bolted shut. She turns, putting her back to it as the Frenchman advances. Smiling rakishly, he removes his gloves. SOMEONE<Marion> tries to dart past,

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS430
01:46:52,00 --> 01:47:00,50
He leans in close. SOMEONE<Marion> recoils as he paws her face and smells her neck. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS432
01:47:01,00 --> 01:47:05,50
Meanwhile, French soldiers. Inside, several women are looking around. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS433
01:47:27,00 --> 01:47:50,50
On the ground, a drunk Frenchman playing a drum falls over. In the shed, SOMEONE<Marion> raises her skirts above her knee boot revealing her milky white leg. The Frenchman snarls lustily and sinks down before her. As he leans his head toward her raised skirts, a sickened scowl overtakes SOMEONE's<Marion's> face and she plunges a dagger into the back of his neck. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS434
01:47:49,00 --> 01:47:53,50
but she kicks him down. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS436
01:48:17,00 --> 01:48:21,50
SOMEONE leads 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS438
01:48:35,00 --> 01:48:40,50
teen orphan pokes his head through and extends a hand. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS439
01:48:39,00 --> 01:48:47,50
SOMEONE<Marion> retrieves the Frenchman's belt and passes it up sword first. Grabbing its leather strap, she 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS440
01:49:03,00 --> 01:49:08,50
several orphans climb down from the roof. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS443
01:49:55,00 --> 01:49:58,50
They pass an infant through a window. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS444
01:50:00,00 --> 01:50:04,50
SOMEONE<Allan> and SOMEONE<Will> pick off Frenchmen. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS446
01:51:13,00 --> 01:51:20,50
as he walks pass the the crowd,  

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS447
01:51:24,00 --> 01:51:29,50
SOMEONE<Marion> sees a cart arriving, pulled by her Clydesdales. noticing SOMEONE<Marion> as she approaches the cart. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS448
01:51:27,00 --> 01:51:48,50
Two pepper haired farm hands meet her. With a mournful gaze, one them holds out Sir SOMEONE's<Walter's> sword. SOMEONE<Marion> purses her lips as she stares at the fallen man's weapon. Accepting it, she manages a stoic nod. SOMEONE<Robin> leaves SOMEONE<Baldwin>. Facing the servants, SOMEONE<Marion> thanks them with a nod. SOMEONE<Robin> arrives behind her. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS449
01:51:49,00 --> 01:52:04,50
As she faces him, her brow furrows woefully. She holds up the sword and hangs her head. SOMEONE<Robin> steps closer and the devastated woman lays her brow on his shoulder. He gently cups her head and shuts his eyes. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS450
01:52:07,00 --> 01:52:31,50
Now, laid out in an open wicker coffin, Sir SOMEONE's<Walter's> body lies clad in snowy robes and surrounded by greenery. One hand holds his sword upon his chest. SOMEONE<Marion> tucks a sprig under his wrist and lays a hand fondly upon his. As servants stand ready with lit torches, she climbs down from the pyre. SOMEONE and his friends respectfully look on him. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS451
01:52:30,00 --> 01:52:41,50
The flames spread quickly devouring the stacked hay and greenery. The fire and smoke soon blot the dead nobleman from view. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS452
01:52:41,00 --> 01:52:49,50
Beneath the overcast sky, the mourners watch the blaze situated before the ruined stone arch. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS453
01:52:47,00 --> 01:52:53,50
Later, SOMEONE<Marion> addresses SOMEONE<Robin> as he readies his horse. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS454
01:52:56,00 --> 01:53:02,50
SOMEONE<Robin> regards her squarely. He steps closer. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS455
01:53:04,00 --> 01:53:14,50
She allows a faint coy smile. SOMEONE<Marion> moves in close and her lips meet his repeatedly sharing eager tender kisses. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS456
01:53:15,00 --> 01:53:39,50
They part slightly. Their noses brushing against each other. SOMEONE<Robin> stares lovingly at her and draws a deep breath. SOMEONE<Marion> joyfully plants another kiss on his lips and takes a step back. As his mounted friends look on a few yards off, SOMEONE<Robin> climbs astride his horse. He gazes down at the noble woman who smiles at him serenely. Her blue eyes sparkling. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS457
01:53:40,00 --> 01:53:49,50
She beams after him as he leads his three trusted friends down the country road. SOMEONE<Marion> proudly watches his departure. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS459
01:54:31,00 --> 01:54:35,50
He sits up. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS460
01:54:35,00 --> 01:54:40,50
hand ready by conical pyres of wood. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS463
01:55:04,00 --> 01:55:08,50
SOMEONE follows the soldier's 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS464
01:55:13,00 --> 01:55:18,50
soldiers light the nearest pyre. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS465
01:55:17,00 --> 01:55:24,50
pyre's ignite one after another in sequence. Foot soldiers patrol close to the surf 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS467
01:55:37,00 --> 01:55:43,50
Now, we soar over hills blanketed with emerald green 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS468
01:55:49,00 --> 01:55:54,50
green hillside, marked with white horse. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS469
01:56:02,00 --> 01:56:08,50
Across a rolling field, mounted troops ride into view. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS470
01:56:20,00 --> 01:56:24,50
SOMEONE<Robin> leads the others off the path. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS471
01:56:29,00 --> 01:56:36,50
In full armor, SOMEONE<Marshal> and King SOMEONE<John> ride out to meet SOMEONE<Robin> and his companions. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS472
01:56:53,00 --> 01:56:58,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE swap look. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS473
01:57:04,00 --> 01:57:08,50
we watch the army advance. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS474
01:58:06,00 --> 01:58:13,50
the narrow beach front dotted by the signal fires, the rocky cliffs behind them. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS475
01:58:32,00 --> 01:58:38,50
Several dozen ships dot the coastal waters. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS477
01:59:09,00 --> 01:59:14,50
capsizes, spilling armored men into the slope leading down to the beach. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS480
01:59:56,00 --> 02:00:00,50
The archers take aim. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS482
02:00:39,00 --> 02:00:44,50
The new comer leads a number of mounted troops on to the beach. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS484
02:00:47,00 --> 02:00:52,50
mysterious leader who lifts the helmet's visor 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS485
02:00:51,00 --> 02:00:56,50
SOMEONE<Robin> stops short. SOMEONE<Marion> resolutely holds

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS486
02:01:00,00 --> 02:01:05,50
She flips down her visor and returns to the battle. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS493
02:03:22,00 --> 02:03:26,50
He seizes another in a choke hold 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS494
02:03:36,00 --> 02:03:41,50
She glares at SOMEONE 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS497
02:04:53,00 --> 02:04:57,50
A dead soldier pierced by arrows. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS498
02:05:15,00 --> 02:05:24,50
SOMEONE<Robin> races to SOMEONE<Marion> and finds her laying still in the water. Standing beside her, he raises his bow. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS499
02:05:27,00 --> 02:05:32,50
SOMEONE<bow> rides away from the battle. SOMEONE<Robin> draws back an arrow. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS500
02:05:33,00 --> 02:05:37,50
The arrow soars free. We ride the 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS501
02:05:39,00 --> 02:05:44,50
SOMEONE's neck as he rides in the 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS502
02:05:48,00 --> 02:05:52,50
he lifts her upper body cradles her.  

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS503
02:05:50,00 --> 02:06:03,50
As he raises her visor, a drop of his blood falls on her pale skin. Water gurgles from her mouth. SOMEONE<Robin> pulls her closer and her helmet falls off revealing a leather

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS504
02:06:02,00 --> 02:06:06,50
touches her face and she opens her 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS505
02:06:05,00 --> 02:06:15,50
Blood trickles from his wounded head to her porcelain cheeks. He pulls away and strokes her face. She wraps an arm around him and 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS506
02:06:31,00 --> 02:06:36,50
On shore, SOMEONE cradles SOMEONE in his arms as he trudges 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS507
02:06:48,00 --> 02:06:52,50
He eyes the king, then points to SOMEONE. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS508
02:06:54,00 --> 02:06:58,50
King SOMEONE<John> sees SOMEONE<Robin>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS509
02:07:14,00 --> 02:07:20,50
a French battle flag sinks to the ocean floor. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS511
02:07:23,00 --> 02:07:46,50
Now, in London. King SOMEONE<John> hold his hand as they walk side by side into the towers outer courtyard. They approach two thrones on a canopied platform. At the front of the crowd, SOMEONE<Marshal> and Queen SOMEONE<Eleanor> bow as the young couple passes. SOMEONE<Isabella> occupies one throne while King SOMEONE<John> stands in front of his and reads the charter. As he runs a finger down the document, SOMEONE<Marshal> and Queen SOMEONE<Eleanor> watch tensely. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS512
02:07:45,00 --> 02:07:50,50
King SOMEONE<John> lifts his gaze to the crowd. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS513
02:07:51,00 --> 02:07:55,50
SOMEONE<Baldwin> shifts uneasily. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS514
02:08:15,00 --> 02:08:19,50
SOMEONE<Isabella> interjects. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS515
02:09:04,00 --> 02:09:09,50
The tyrant turns away from the crowd. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS516
02:09:15,00 --> 02:09:24,50
Now in Nottingham, peasants bundle golden sheaves of wheat and cart them off. The sheriff and his men ride into town. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS517
02:09:25,00 --> 02:09:30,50
in a tree bearing several dog eared decrees. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS518
02:09:29,00 --> 02:09:34,50
He unrolls a document and reads. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS519
02:09:51,00 --> 02:09:58,50
The crowd watches as the sheriff uses one hand to steady the decree on the tree trunk. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS520
02:09:59,00 --> 02:10:03,50
The villagers remain still. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS521
02:10:11,00 --> 02:10:22,50
The sheriff stares fearfully into the surrounding forest. Now, SOMEONE<Robin> rides his white steed among the trees. As he heads deeper into the woods, SOMEONE<Will>, SOMEONE<Allan> and

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS522
02:10:20,00 --> 02:10:26,50
SOMEONE<John> carries a deer over his shoulders. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS523
02:10:24,00 --> 02:10:30,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> and some orphan boys step a pace with SOMEONE<Robin> as well. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS524
02:10:35,00 --> 02:10:45,50
as high above their heads and watches them pass. They arrive at a makeshift village of straw roofs and stick walled huts deep in the forest. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS525
02:10:50,00 --> 02:10:55,50
She spoons medicine into a young boy's mouth. She pats 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS526
02:10:55,00 --> 02:10:59,50
other orphan sits. She watches 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS527
02:10:57,00 --> 02:11:01,50
boys gather around SOMEONE<Robin>. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS528
02:11:18,00 --> 02:11:25,50
SOMEONE<Robin> notices SOMEONE<Marion> watching him and heads toward her. She smiles. 

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS529
02:11:24,00 --> 02:11:30,50
He wraps one arm around her waist and she does the same to him.  

ROBIN_HOOD_DVS530
02:11:27,00 --> 02:11:33,50
They turn in a circle.
