RUBY_SPARKS_DVS28
00:02:44,00 --> 00:02:49,50
A dark-haired man runs beside him.

An old woman walks beside them. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS30
00:03:19,00 --> 00:03:24,50
The brothers trade a wry smirk. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS31
00:03:22,00 --> 00:03:26,50
Later, they use weight machines. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS32
00:03:28,00 --> 00:03:34,50
The young man glances aside then faces SOMEONE<Harry>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS33
00:03:58,00 --> 00:04:07,50
The young man lowers his gaze and continues exercising his arms. SOMEONE<Harry> resumes his workout.

He hands SOMEONE<Calvin> a teddy bear. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS38
00:06:02,00 --> 00:06:10,50
Now, a woman hurries into a building, passing an advertisement for two authors. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS39
00:06:07,00 --> 00:06:12,50
SOMEONE<Weir-Fields> and SOMEONE<Langdon> Tharp.

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS42
00:07:13,00 --> 00:07:19,50

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS43
00:07:17,00 --> 00:07:25,50

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS46
00:07:50,00 --> 00:07:59,50
Now, we follow SOMEONE<Calvin> through a hallway. As a crowd crosses the other end, he turns back and walks in the opposite direction. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS47
00:07:56,00 --> 00:08:02,50
A man in a nice suit steps out from a doorway.

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS64
00:10:22,00 --> 00:10:29,50
Letting himself fall over the back of the couch, he plops on the cushions. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS65
00:10:28,00 --> 00:10:35,50
Now, the young woman looks down at SOMEONE<Calvin>, the afternoon sun gleaming over her shoulder. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS66
00:10:59,00 --> 00:11:07,50
The red-haired young woman kneels beside SOMEONE<Calvin> who sits under a tree with a book.

00:12:39,00 --> 00:12:44,50
On the sofa, SOMEONE<Calvin> wakes with a start.

00:12:45,00 --> 00:12:49,50

Puts on his glasses and dashes upstairs. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS75
00:12:49,00 --> 00:12:55,50
Sitting at his desk, he types feverishly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS76
00:12:52,00 --> 00:12:57,50
His eyes open wide and his jaw hanging slack. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS77
00:12:55,00 --> 00:13:02,50
The typewriter hammers out the words, in front of him, backlit by the sun. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS78
00:13:00,00 --> 00:13:05,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> slides the typewriter's carriage repeatedly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS79
00:13:02,00 --> 00:13:07,50
Writing through days and nights. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS80
00:13:05,00 --> 00:13:11,50
In the daytime, he sits with his feet up, reading over his pages.

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS83
00:13:16,00 --> 00:13:20,50
Eyeing the dog curiously. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS84
00:13:17,00 --> 00:13:23,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> takes the shoe and drops it on the desk. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS85
00:13:20,00 --> 00:13:25,50

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS87
00:14:46,00 --> 00:14:51,50
Now with his therapist. SOMEONE<Calvin> lies back on the couch. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS88
00:15:09,00 --> 00:15:16,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> looks at a ceiling vent. He imagines SOMEONE<Ruby> on roller skates. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS89
00:15:28,00 --> 00:15:33,50
In her year book photo, she wears a leather jacket. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS90
00:15:49,00 --> 00:15:54,50
He imagines her riding a bicycle. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS91
00:16:09,00 --> 00:16:14,50
She rides away down a leaf covered path. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS92
00:16:13,00 --> 00:16:17,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> and SOMEONE<Harry> jog the same path. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS93
00:16:20,00 --> 00:16:25,50
Later, they enter SOMEONE's<Calvin's> house. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS94
00:16:38,00 --> 00:16:45,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE<Calvin> towels off his hair and combs through it with his fingers. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS95
00:16:42,00 --> 00:16:49,50
He opens the cabinet, revealing a woman's razor on the shelf. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS96
00:16:46,00 --> 00:16:53,50
Behind it, a can of shaving cream with a feminine design reads, Satin Care. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS97
00:16:50,00 --> 00:16:56,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> studies the razor with a confused frown. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS98
00:16:53,00 --> 00:16:58,50
Then takes both items downstairs. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS99
00:16:55,00 --> 00:17:00,50
SOMEONE<Harry> sits on the couch with an infant. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS100
00:17:13,00 --> 00:17:17,50
SOMEONE<Harry> presents a bra. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS102
00:17:45,00 --> 00:17:50,50
Random woman's items fill the drawer. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS103
00:17:58,00 --> 00:18:04,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> gives SOMEONE<Susie> a wide-eyed sheepish stare as she shuts the drawer. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS104
00:18:02,00 --> 00:18:07,50
Later, he rinses off a plate and lays it out to dry. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS105
00:18:11,00 --> 00:18:19,50
On a patio, SOMEONE<Harry> sits in a lounge chair, drinking a beer as he reads the manuscript. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS106
00:18:16,00 --> 00:18:23,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> comes near, peeks over his shoulder, and perches on the edge of another lounge chair. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS107
00:18:21,00 --> 00:18:25,50
A swimming pool shimmers nearby. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS108
00:18:23,00 --> 00:18:30,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> interlaces his fingers and leans toward SOMEONE<Harry> with an eager hopeful smile. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS109
00:19:56,00 --> 00:20:01,50
He smiles gently. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS110
00:19:58,00 --> 00:20:04,50
Later, SOMEONE<Susie> uses a baby carrier to haul SOMEONE<Myles> to a car. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS111
00:20:04,00 --> 00:20:09,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> lowers his shy gaze. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS112
00:20:15,00 --> 00:20:23,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> sees the couple off then heads inside. Moving through the foyer, he switches off the table lamp. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS113
00:20:21,00 --> 00:20:27,50
He steps around his staircase and picks up the manuscript. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS114
00:20:27,00 --> 00:20:32,50
Turning, SOMEONE<Calvin> pauses. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS115
00:20:31,00 --> 00:20:39,50
He opens the drawer, stashing the mysterious woman's items then gently runs his fingertips over them. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS116
00:20:37,00 --> 00:20:41,50
Now at his desk. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS117
00:20:38,00 --> 00:20:43,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> taps away at his typewriter. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS118
00:20:41,00 --> 00:20:48,50
With a dreamy wistful gaze he writes, This thing is dripping everywhere. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS120
00:20:54,00 --> 00:21:03,50
In the imagined scene, SOMEONE<Calvin> and SOMEONE<Ruby> sit on his pool deck, enjoying takeout burgers and soft drinks. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS121
00:21:00,00 --> 00:21:04,50
Chewing, he pauses. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS122
00:21:03,00 --> 00:21:07,50
She grins sweetly at him. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS123
00:21:23,00 --> 00:21:29,50
At his typewriter, SOMEONE<Calvin> beams fondly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS124
00:21:44,00 --> 00:21:50,50
Watching SOMEONE<Calvin>, SOMEONE<Ruby> coyly nibbles her soda straw. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS125
00:21:54,00 --> 00:22:00,50
At his typewriter, SOMEONE<Calvin> furrows his brow and pauses briefly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS126
00:22:03,00 --> 00:22:09,50
Under her vulnerable gaze, SOMEONE's<Calvin's> expression softens. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS127
00:22:08,00 --> 00:22:13,50
She smiles tenderly at him. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS128
00:22:12,00 --> 00:22:16,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> leans in close to her. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS129
00:22:14,00 --> 00:22:19,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> springs up and dashes pass him. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS130
00:22:18,00 --> 00:22:25,50
In her sundress and bare feet, she leaps into the narrow swimming pool. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS131
00:22:22,00 --> 00:22:27,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> jumps in after her, fully clothed. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS132
00:22:25,00 --> 00:22:31,50
The two swim around one another in a softly illuminated water. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS133
00:23:04,00 --> 00:23:09,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> finishes typing. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS134
00:23:06,00 --> 00:23:12,50
Beaming wistfully at the page, he shuts his eyes. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS136
00:23:15,00 --> 00:23:19,50
He runs through the house. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS137
00:23:18,00 --> 00:23:24,50
He finds his cellphone in a pile of clothes and answers it. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS138
00:23:24,00 --> 00:23:28,50
He presses a few buttons. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS139
00:24:02,00 --> 00:24:10,50
On his way out, SOMEONE<Calvin> freezes. SOMEONE<Ruby> stands in his kitchen, eating a bowl of cereal. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS140
00:24:16,00 --> 00:24:21,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> backs up and sinks to the floor. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS141
00:24:30,00 --> 00:24:34,50
He springs from her touch. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS142
00:24:32,00 --> 00:24:37,50
He runs upstairs and into his office. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS143
00:24:54,00 --> 00:25:02,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> looks around with his hand on his chest. His wide eyes magnified by his glasses. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS144
00:25:00,00 --> 00:25:05,50
He ventures cautiously from his office. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS145
00:25:05,00 --> 00:25:11,50
Reaching the upstairs landing, he peers over the railing. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS146
00:25:09,00 --> 00:25:15,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> finds no sign of the woman downstairs. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS147
00:25:13,00 --> 00:25:18,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> turns away, his body relaxing. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS148
00:25:17,00 --> 00:25:22,50
He faces another railing with a smile. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS149
00:25:24,00 --> 00:25:28,50
He crawls away fearfully. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS150
00:25:30,00 --> 00:25:35,50
He dashes through doorway and slams it shut behind him. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS152
00:25:34,00 --> 00:25:43,50
Now in his bathroom, SOMEONE<Calvin> dials a call on his cellphone and paces. He removes his glasses briefly and rubs his eyes. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS153
00:25:48,00 --> 00:25:55,50
Ending the call, he braces both hands on the counter and leans over breathlessly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS154
00:25:52,00 --> 00:25:56,50
Now in the kitchen. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS155
00:25:54,00 --> 00:25:59,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> whisks eggs in a glass mixing bowl. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS156
00:25:56,00 --> 00:26:04,50
As she adds hot sauce, SOMEONE<Calvin> creeps downstairs and musters a casual demeanor. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS157
00:26:05,00 --> 00:26:09,50
She steps out of the kitchen. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS158
00:26:15,00 --> 00:26:21,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> forces a hungry smile. SOMEONE<Ruby> steps closer. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS159
00:26:26,00 --> 00:26:30,50
He lifts the bra. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS160
00:26:44,00 --> 00:26:48,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> stares skeptically. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS161
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:53,50
Now SOMEONE<Calvin> hides under his desk as he uses his phone. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS162
00:27:07,00 --> 00:27:11,50
In a conference room. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS163
00:27:53,00 --> 00:27:58,50
SOMEONE<Harry> ends the call. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS164
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:05,50
He crawls out from under his desk. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS165
00:28:12,00 --> 00:28:17,50
Opening a drawer, he finds another number. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS166
00:28:18,00 --> 00:28:22,50
He ends the call. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS167
00:28:19,00 --> 00:28:26,50
Now as we face a stairway behind an entertainment system. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS168
00:28:23,00 --> 00:28:30,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> creeps down into view, his arms crooked before him cartoonishly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS169
00:28:28,00 --> 00:28:33,50
He stares fearfully toward the kitchen. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS170
00:28:30,00 --> 00:28:36,50
He sinks down behind the system and peeks out. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS171
00:28:33,00 --> 00:28:37,50
But finds no sign of SOMEONE<Ruby>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS172
00:28:35,00 --> 00:28:41,50
Stepping off the stairs, he accidentally squishes a dog toy. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS173
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:46,50
He freezes then precedes to the foyer where he picks up his keys and wallet. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS174
00:28:44,00 --> 00:28:50,50
At the top of the foyer stairs, SOMEONE<Ruby> steps out in a dress. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS175
00:29:08,00 --> 00:29:13,50
As she descends he backs to the door. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS176
00:29:12,00 --> 00:29:16,50
He gives a feeble shake of his head. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS177
00:29:14,00 --> 00:29:22,50
Now, SOMEONE<Calvin> slumps miserably as he drives down a street lined with quaint storefronts. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS178
00:29:19,00 --> 00:29:24,50
He casts his fearful gaze aside. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS179
00:29:22,00 --> 00:29:26,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> rides with him. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS180
00:29:23,00 --> 00:29:29,50
She eyes him uncertainly then smooths her hair. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS181
00:29:27,00 --> 00:29:32,50
Leaning forward, she turns on the radio. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS182
00:29:35,00 --> 00:29:41,50
Now SOMEONE<Calvin> feeds a meter in the artsy Los Feliz neighborhood. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS183
00:29:43,00 --> 00:29:48,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> accompanies him down the sidewalk. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS184
00:30:05,00 --> 00:30:10,50
Later, SOMEONE<Calvin> shares an outdoor table with Mabel. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS185
00:30:43,00 --> 00:30:47,50
She stares meaningfully at him. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS186
00:30:49,00 --> 00:30:55,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> watches her shift giddily then glances away. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS187
00:31:12,00 --> 00:31:16,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> approaches. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS188
00:31:23,00 --> 00:31:29,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> adjust his chair, Mabel shifts closer. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS189
00:32:04,00 --> 00:32:09,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> grabs a busboy. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS190
00:32:09,00 --> 00:32:14,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> makes the busboy touch SOMEONE<Ruby>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS191
00:32:12,00 --> 00:32:18,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> throws a glass of water in his face. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS192
00:32:16,00 --> 00:32:20,50
She runs off. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS193
00:32:19,00 --> 00:32:23,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> chases after her. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS194
00:32:24,00 --> 00:32:29,50
She whacks him with her purse and he grabs her. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS195
00:32:52,00 --> 00:32:58,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> lifts her over his shoulder and carries her down the sidewalk. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS196
00:33:01,00 --> 00:33:05,50
He sets her down. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS197
00:33:21,00 --> 00:33:26,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> brushes her long bangs aside. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS198
00:33:33,00 --> 00:33:38,50
He caresses her lips with his thumb. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS199
00:33:42,00 --> 00:33:50,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> cups her face in his hands. Staring up at him tearfully, SOMEONE<Ruby> yields a smile. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS200
00:33:49,00 --> 00:33:54,50
She shakes her head and sighs. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS201
00:33:53,00 --> 00:34:00,50
She shuts her eyes ecstatically as he leans his face toward hers. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS202
00:33:57,00 --> 00:34:03,50
Their lips meet in an ardent tender kiss. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS203
00:34:03,00 --> 00:34:09,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> pulls back, his brow knitted emotionally. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS204
00:34:11,00 --> 00:34:17,50
They gaze into each other's eyes. SOMEONE<Calvin> kisses her again. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS205
00:34:15,00 --> 00:34:22,50
Now at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, a movie screen shows Zombie Attacks. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS206
00:34:20,00 --> 00:34:27,50
Seated on the crowded lawn, SOMEONE<Ruby> and SOMEONE<Calvin> each take a shot. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS207
00:34:24,00 --> 00:34:30,50
Later, SOMEONE<Calvin> covers a laughing SOMEONE's<Ruby's> eyes. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS208
00:34:27,00 --> 00:34:32,50
A zombie tears a woman's head off. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS209
00:34:29,00 --> 00:34:35,50
And another clumsily stalks a victim on the floor. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS210
00:34:32,00 --> 00:34:38,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> lunges, playfully biting SOMEONE's<Calvin's> neck. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS211
00:34:35,00 --> 00:34:42,50
Now he catches up to her in an arcade and she greets him with a kiss. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS212
00:34:39,00 --> 00:34:46,50
Later, she peeks out of a video game booth and draws him in with her. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS213
00:34:44,00 --> 00:34:52,50
They play a game with gun-shaped controllers. SOMEONE<Ruby> coolly blows the end of her gun's barrel. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS214
00:34:49,00 --> 00:34:53,50
They dance in the arcade. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS215
00:34:51,00 --> 00:34:56,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> lays her back on a pinball machine. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS216
00:34:53,00 --> 00:35:00,50
As he nuzzles her between her breasts, she blissfully sweeps her arms past her head. Later, SOMEONE<Ruby> runs up to him and leaps into his arms. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS218
00:35:01,00 --> 00:35:07,50
Now they bounce up and down on a crowded dance floor. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS219
00:35:04,00 --> 00:35:09,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> raises her arms and shakes her head. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS220
00:35:06,00 --> 00:35:11,50
While SOMEONE<Calvin> bobs exuberantly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS221
00:35:08,00 --> 00:35:13,50
Later, he deeps dips her and they kiss. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS222
00:35:11,00 --> 00:35:17,50
Straightening, she slaps his chest to the music. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS223
00:35:14,00 --> 00:35:19,50
Now, she jerks her head side-to-side. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS229
00:35:28,00 --> 00:35:34,50
From the top of her dress, SOMEONE<Ruby> pulls out panties and twirls them on her finger. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS230
00:35:32,00 --> 00:35:37,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> stops dancing staring wide-eyed. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS231
00:35:34,00 --> 00:35:39,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> puts their waistband in her teeth. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS232
00:35:37,00 --> 00:35:42,50
And points discreetly off the dance floor. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS233
00:35:39,00 --> 00:35:45,50
Now at a restaurant, SOMEONE<Calvin> enjoys chips and guacamole. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS234
00:35:44,00 --> 00:35:49,50
He chews blissfully. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS235
00:35:46,00 --> 00:35:51,50
Facing him, SOMEONE<Harry> stares slack-jawed. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS236
00:36:20,00 --> 00:36:26,50
SOMEONE's<Calvin's> brother averts his worried gaze. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS237
00:36:25,00 --> 00:36:30,50
SOMEONE's<Calvin's> smile falters sheepishly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS238
00:36:28,00 --> 00:36:35,50
He eats another chip with guacamole, points approvingly and sips a margarita. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS239
00:36:53,00 --> 00:36:57,50
A man passes by. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS240
00:37:03,00 --> 00:37:09,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> looks around then leans back in his chair. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS241
00:37:10,00 --> 00:37:15,50
Later, SOMEONE<Calvin> lets SOMEONE<Harry> into the house. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS242
00:37:27,00 --> 00:37:32,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> jumps into SOMEONE's<Calvin's> arms. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS243
00:37:55,00 --> 00:37:59,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> steps away. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS244
00:38:00,00 --> 00:38:05,50
SOMEONE<Harry> leads SOMEONE<Calvin> onto the balcony. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS245
00:38:02,00 --> 00:38:10,50
Through a glass door, SOMEONE<Calvin> waves to SOMEONE<Ruby> and motions one minute. Donning an apron, she waves back. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS246
00:38:08,00 --> 00:38:12,50
The brothers hurry down a staircase. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS248
00:39:20,00 --> 00:39:24,50
SOMEONE<Harry> glances inside. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS249
00:39:23,00 --> 00:39:28,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> looks up at the house and shakes his head. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS250
00:39:26,00 --> 00:39:30,50
SOMEONE<Harry> takes his phone back. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS251
00:39:31,00 --> 00:39:36,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> leads the way up the staircase. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS252
00:39:38,00 --> 00:39:45,50
From the kitchen counter, SOMEONE<Ruby> watches SOMEONE<Calvin> and SOMEONE<Harry> return to the balcony. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS253
00:39:42,00 --> 00:39:48,50
The cross to the door with an affected breezy air. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS254
00:39:49,00 --> 00:39:55,50
Watching them head upstairs, she grins. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS255
00:39:56,00 --> 00:40:00,50
In the office. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS256
00:39:59,00 --> 00:40:05,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> readies the typewriter. SOMEONE<Harry> glances over the railing. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS257
00:40:14,00 --> 00:40:19,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> stares dumbly at the page. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS258
00:40:16,00 --> 00:40:20,50
SOMEONE<Harry> contemplates. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS259
00:40:23,00 --> 00:40:28,50
SOMEONE<Harry> meets SOMEONE's<Calvin's> gaze and points. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS260
00:40:28,00 --> 00:40:34,50
He steps around the desk and whispers in his brother's ear. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS261
00:40:31,00 --> 00:40:36,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> shoots him an incredulous look. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS262
00:40:40,00 --> 00:40:48,50
A reluctant SOMEONE<Calvin> starts typing and we glimpse his words as they spell out on the page. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS263
00:40:45,00 --> 00:40:49,50
Speak in fluent French. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS264
00:40:47,00 --> 00:40:51,50
She had no awareness. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS269
00:40:59,00 --> 00:41:05,50
The brothers trade a look. Now in the kitchen. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS270
00:41:15,00 --> 00:41:20,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> notes their perplexed grins. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS271
00:41:30,00 --> 00:41:36,50
Left alone with her, SOMEONE<Harry> backs against a wall. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS272
00:41:43,00 --> 00:41:49,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> types rapidly, his eyes wide and his jaw slack. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS273
00:41:47,00 --> 00:41:52,50
He looks up from his typewriter then hurries out. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS274
00:41:49,00 --> 00:41:55,50
He returns to the kitchen presenting a bottle of wine. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS275
00:41:58,00 --> 00:42:02,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> steps out. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS276
00:42:00,00 --> 00:42:06,50
Holding a salad bowl, SOMEONE<Harry> wears a silly grin on his way to the dining room. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS278
00:43:01,00 --> 00:43:06,50
Now, the brothers step out front. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS279
00:43:14,00 --> 00:43:19,50
They get in SOMEONE's<Harry's> silver Sedan. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS280
00:43:19,00 --> 00:43:25,50
SOMEONE<Harry> repeatedly slams his back against the seat. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS281
00:43:41,00 --> 00:43:45,50
SOMEONE<Harry> stares at him. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS282
00:44:09,00 --> 00:44:14,50
SOMEONE<Harry> shifts his sympathetic gaze. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS283
00:44:16,00 --> 00:44:21,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> opens the passenger door. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS284
00:44:24,00 --> 00:44:30,50
He holds his brother's gaze then pulls the door shut. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS285
00:45:12,00 --> 00:45:17,50
The brothers look each other in the eye. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS286
00:45:19,00 --> 00:45:28,50
Later in his office, SOMEONE<Calvin> gathers the pages of his manuscript and locks them away in a desk drawer. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS287
00:45:37,00 --> 00:45:42,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> rolls his chair over to SOMEONE<Ruby>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS288
00:45:45,00 --> 00:45:51,50
She sits on his lap and wraps her arms around him. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS289
00:45:50,00 --> 00:45:56,50
They share a loving gaze then kiss passionately. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS290
00:45:57,00 --> 00:46:06,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> spins the chair and they twirl in place, remaining lip locked as the image gradually fades to black. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS291
00:46:10,00 --> 00:46:18,50
Now stuck in traffic, SOMEONE<Calvin> reaches for his cellphone as SOMEONE<Ruby> plays a game on it. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS292
00:46:56,00 --> 00:47:00,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> begs SOMEONE<Calvin>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS293
00:47:01,00 --> 00:47:06,50
Night time at the house. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS294
00:47:20,00 --> 00:47:25,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> joins SOMEONE<Ruby> in bed. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS295
00:47:22,00 --> 00:47:27,50
Her sketches adorned the headboard. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS296
00:47:39,00 --> 00:47:43,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> leans in for a kiss. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS297
00:47:47,00 --> 00:47:53,50
As SOMEONE<Ruby> sets a tablet aside, SOMEONE<Calvin> turns off a lamp. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS298
00:47:51,00 --> 00:47:59,50
Leaving the room in total darkness, but for the alarm clock which reads 11:56. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS299
00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:15,50
In the morning, SOMEONE<Calvin> packs a duffel bag with clothes. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS300
00:48:14,00 --> 00:48:20,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> wakes up, spots him at the foot of the bed and sits up. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS301
00:48:30,00 --> 00:48:35,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> beams and SOMEONE<Calvin> jumps on the bed with her. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS302
00:48:35,00 --> 00:48:43,50
Now SOMEONE<Calvin>, SOMEONE<Ruby> and SOMEONE<Scotty> drive up the Pacific Coast Highway in a convertible BMW. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS303
00:48:42,00 --> 00:48:48,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> snakes her hand through the wind outside of the car. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS304
00:48:46,00 --> 00:48:52,50
Embracing SOMEONE<Calvin>, she feeds him a snack. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS305
00:48:49,00 --> 00:48:56,50
They run across the beach together then pace to the opposite ends of a long drift wood log. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS306
00:48:54,00 --> 00:49:00,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> mimes shooting SOMEONE<Calvin> and he falls to the sand. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS307
00:48:58,00 --> 00:49:06,50
Later, they continue up the coast with the Pacific Ocean just feet from the road. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS308
00:49:03,00 --> 00:49:10,50
Now with the convertible's top up, the couple arrives at a wooden gate. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS309
00:49:07,00 --> 00:49:12,50
SOMEONE<Scotty> sits on SOMEONE's<Ruby's> lap. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS310
00:49:09,00 --> 00:49:17,50
The gate opens automatically, revealing an abundance of shrubs and trees around a driveway. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS311
00:49:27,00 --> 00:49:33,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> parks the car then turns to SOMEONE<Ruby>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS312
00:49:39,00 --> 00:49:44,50
A woman with tussled hair taps on the window. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS315
00:50:05,00 --> 00:50:12,50
SOMEONE's<Calvin's> mom opens a wooden door and leads them pass more lush plant life. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS316
00:50:27,00 --> 00:50:34,50
Inside an open yet cozy home, candles adorn a huge brick fireplace. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS317
00:51:07,00 --> 00:51:12,50
A small room with an elevated bed. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS319
00:51:26,00 --> 00:51:32,50
They find SOMEONE<Mort> wielding a chainsaw. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS320
00:51:36,00 --> 00:51:41,50
SOMEONE<Mort> lifts his helmet's face mask. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS321
00:51:40,00 --> 00:51:47,50
He grins. Later the scruffy man feeds SOMEONE<Scotty> table scraps. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS322
00:52:31,00 --> 00:52:35,50
SOMEONE<Mort> kisses her hand. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS323
00:52:35,00 --> 00:52:39,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> glances at his brother. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS324
00:52:36,00 --> 00:52:41,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> smiles at him. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS325
00:52:38,00 --> 00:52:43,50
Later, they play charades. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS326
00:52:43,00 --> 00:52:49,50
SOMEONE's<Calvin's> mom gestures to SOMEONE<Ruby> and SOMEONE<Susie>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS327
00:52:58,00 --> 00:53:08,50
SOMEONE<Harry> pats his frustrated brother on the back. SOMEONE's<Calvin's> mom points to her breasts then pushes away the men and grabs her behind. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS328
00:53:20,00 --> 00:53:25,50
The jubilant women embrace. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS329
00:53:28,00 --> 00:53:34,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> watches his mother give SOMEONE<Mort> a hug. SOMEONE<Mort> pats her rear end. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS330
00:53:36,00 --> 00:53:42,50
After a shower, SOMEONE<Ruby> covers herself with a towel. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS331
00:53:58,00 --> 00:54:03,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> joins SOMEONE<Calvin> in bed. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS332
00:54:15,00 --> 00:54:20,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> lies on her side, turning away from SOMEONE<Calvin>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS333
00:54:18,00 --> 00:54:23,50
He returns his attention to a book. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS334
00:54:20,00 --> 00:54:26,50
The next day, SOMEONE<Ruby> cannonballs into a pool. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS335
00:54:26,00 --> 00:54:33,50
SOMEONE<Mort> stands on a roof near a waterfall flowing into the pool. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS336
00:54:31,00 --> 00:54:37,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> reads in a tree house. He steps out to a railing. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS337
00:54:53,00 --> 00:55:00,50
SOMEONE<Mort> cannonballs off the roof, making a huge splash. SOMEONE<Calvin> watches them. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS338
00:55:02,00 --> 00:55:08,50
Later, SOMEONE's<Calvin's> mom climbs up to the tree house. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS339
00:55:07,00 --> 00:55:14,50
She finds her son sleeping on his back, holding the book over his chest. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS340
00:55:16,00 --> 00:55:20,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> sits up. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS341
00:55:34,00 --> 00:55:40,50
She climbs back down. Later after dinner. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS342
00:55:40,00 --> 00:55:44,50
SOMEONE<Harry> lights a joint. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS343
00:55:44,00 --> 00:55:50,50
Holding the dog, SOMEONE<Mort> copies his blank droopy stare. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS344
00:55:52,00 --> 00:56:00,50
SOMEONE<Mort> makes the same face but with a crinkled brow. He holds glasses over SOMEONE's<Scotty's> eyes. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS345
00:55:58,00 --> 00:56:05,50
Wearing an indignant smirk, SOMEONE<Calvin> cocks his head and scans the group. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS346
00:56:11,00 --> 00:56:15,50
SOMEONE<Mort> offers the joint. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS347
00:56:43,00 --> 00:56:47,50
He kisses SOMEONE<Susie>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS348
00:56:50,00 --> 00:56:55,50
Leaving the table, SOMEONE<Harry> falls down drunkenly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS349
00:56:56,00 --> 00:57:01,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> rushes over, the other's stare. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS350
00:57:04,00 --> 00:57:09,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> and SOMEONE<Susie> help SOMEONE<Harry> out. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS351
00:57:13,00 --> 00:57:20,50
SOMEONE<Mort> kisses SOMEONE's<Calvin's> mother on the head and goes. She faces SOMEONE<Ruby>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS352
00:57:27,00 --> 00:57:33,50
The mother picks up a photo album lying on the table. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS353
00:57:31,00 --> 00:57:37,50
She finds a photo of herself wearing a polo shirt. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS354
00:57:34,00 --> 00:57:40,50
Standing beside a preppy man, she holds a trophy. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS355
00:57:57,00 --> 00:58:01,50
A large driftwood chair. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS356
00:58:19,00 --> 00:58:29,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> scoldingly gestures toward the piece. SOMEONE<Calvin> looks back and forth between Mort and the women with folded arms. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS357
00:58:28,00 --> 00:58:34,50
Now, the young couple drives with the ocean to the right. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS358
00:58:31,00 --> 00:58:40,50
The chair tied awkwardly in the back seat with SOMEONE's<Scotty's> carrier. Both SOMEONE<Calvin> and SOMEONE<Ruby> stare straight ahead unhappily. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS361
00:59:01,00 --> 00:59:07,50
Now the young writer reads on his sofa while SOMEONE<Ruby> cooks. SOMEONE<Ruby> faces him through the kitchen window with a wounded stare. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS362
00:59:05,00 --> 00:59:09,50
He resumes reading. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS363
00:59:06,00 --> 00:59:13,50
Holding a cooking utensil in each hand, SOMEONE<Ruby> drops them on a plate. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS364
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:17,50
Later, SOMEONE<Calvin> finds her curled up in a chair facing a window. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS365
00:59:15,00 --> 00:59:20,50
She gazes out at the view as he shuffles over to her. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS366
00:59:28,00 --> 00:59:32,50
She blinks sadly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS367
00:59:30,00 --> 00:59:36,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> crouches down beside her with a furrowed brow. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS368
00:59:33,00 --> 00:59:39,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> shifts in her seat to face him and leans forward. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS369
00:59:36,00 --> 00:59:43,50
As he watches her anxiously, she meets his gaze with tearful eyes. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS370
00:59:50,00 --> 00:59:56,50
SOMEONE's<Calvin's> brow lifts and he bows his head. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS371
00:59:58,00 --> 01:00:02,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> wraps her in his arms. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS372
01:00:05,00 --> 01:00:10,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> gives an earnest shake of his head. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS373
01:00:28,00 --> 01:00:35,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> shifts his bewildered gaze then shrugs and smiles. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS374
01:00:33,00 --> 01:00:39,50
Now in bed, SOMEONE<Calvin> stares up at the ceiling. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS375
01:00:36,00 --> 01:00:42,50
SOMEONE<Scotty> sleeps on the pillow beside his. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS376
01:00:39,00 --> 01:00:45,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> rolls over and eyes the clock reading 4:45. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS377
01:00:43,00 --> 01:00:49,50
Now he and SOMEONE<Scotty> wait outside as SOMEONE<Ruby> bikes up to the house. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS378
01:00:51,00 --> 01:00:56,50
The little dog runs up to her. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS379
01:00:54,00 --> 01:00:58,50
Later in the foyer. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS380
01:01:04,00 --> 01:01:11,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> takes off her bike helmet and shakes out her hair. SOMEONE<Calvin> stares at her. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS381
01:01:27,00 --> 01:01:32,50
She jogs upstairs. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS382
01:01:30,00 --> 01:01:37,50
SOMEONE<Scotty> follows at her heels. SOMEONE<Calvin> remains below, staring up after them. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS383
01:01:35,00 --> 01:01:43,50
Now, his digital clock reads 3:19 as he lies in bed with SOMEONE<Scotty>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS384
01:01:40,00 --> 01:01:44,50
Wide awake and pouting, 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS385
01:01:42,00 --> 01:01:48,50
he rolls on to his side and curls a hand around the little dog's belly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS386
01:01:46,00 --> 01:01:52,50
Now, he cooks an elaborate dish in a pan. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS387
01:01:51,00 --> 01:01:55,50
He snaps up a phone. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS388
01:02:16,00 --> 01:02:20,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> pauses. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS389
01:02:31,00 --> 01:02:37,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> freezes, staring off with a scowl. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS390
01:02:42,00 --> 01:02:49,50
He sets the phone in its cradle then faces the food cooking in the pan. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS391
01:02:49,00 --> 01:02:57,50
At night, SOMEONE<Calvin> lies curled up in bed staring woefully at the unoccupied pillow beside him. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS392
01:02:58,00 --> 01:03:05,50
Moving hesitantly, he turns on a bedside lamp and shifts his tempted gaze. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS393
01:03:03,00 --> 01:03:10,50
Now in his home office, SOMEONE<Calvin> unlocks his desk drawer. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS394
01:03:11,00 --> 01:03:15,50
He pulls out the manuscript. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS395
01:03:14,00 --> 01:03:21,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> sets the stack of paper beside his typewriter and slips a page out from the bottom. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS396
01:03:21,00 --> 01:03:28,50
With tentative movements, he feeds the sheet of paper into the typewriter carriage. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS397
01:03:25,00 --> 01:03:31,50
And adjust its position on the roller. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS398
01:03:36,00 --> 01:03:42,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> slides the carriage to its starting position. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS399
01:03:39,00 --> 01:03:45,50
He brings his fingers down to the keys and hesitates. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS400
01:03:43,00 --> 01:03:49,50
The metal type bars gleams softly in the lamplight. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS401
01:03:46,00 --> 01:03:51,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> stares at the typewriter. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS402
01:03:48,00 --> 01:03:54,50
His eyeglasses reflecting the well-worn keys. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS403
01:03:51,00 --> 01:03:59,50
With a creased brow he types, SOMEONE<Ruby> was miserable without SOMEONE<Calvin>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS404
01:03:56,00 --> 01:04:03,50
The writer slides the carriage to the return position and writes another line. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS405
01:04:01,00 --> 01:04:07,50
He halts, raises his hands, and rests them in his lap. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS406
01:04:05,00 --> 01:04:10,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> leans back in his chair and bows his head. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS407
01:04:08,00 --> 01:04:13,50
Silhouetted against the soft lamplight. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS408
01:04:10,00 --> 01:04:16,50
His lanky figure curves softly in a melancholy slouch. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS409
01:04:15,00 --> 01:04:19,50
He lunges for the phone. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS410
01:04:18,00 --> 01:04:26,50
Now in bed, SOMEONE<Ruby> lies naked on top of SOMEONE<Calvin> as he holds her blissfully. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS411
01:04:23,00 --> 01:04:28,50
He starts to sidle out from under her. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS412
01:04:31,00 --> 01:04:36,50
Remaining with her, SOMEONE<Calvin> strokes her cheek. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS413
01:04:35,00 --> 01:04:41,50
He rolls his head to the side with an uncomfortable gaze. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS414
01:04:38,00 --> 01:04:44,50
Now the two share a bowl of cereal. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS415
01:04:41,00 --> 01:04:49,50
As SOMEONE<Calvin> lets go of his spoon, SOMEONE<Ruby> grabs hold of his hand and rests her cheek against it. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS416
01:04:47,00 --> 01:04:54,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> sets down his newspaper, using his free hand to take another bite of cereal. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS417
01:04:53,00 --> 01:04:59,50
As he continues reading, SOMEONE<Ruby> stares at him intensely. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS418
01:04:59,00 --> 01:05:05,50
She bursts into tears and leans against his shoulder. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS419
01:05:06,00 --> 01:05:12,50
Now she snuggles him as they watch a movie on TV. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS420
01:05:24,00 --> 01:05:32,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> grabs his hand, nearly yanking him off balance, he gives a bewildered nod. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS421
01:05:29,00 --> 01:05:35,50
As he hurries from the room, SOMEONE<Ruby> trots along with him. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS422
01:05:32,00 --> 01:05:38,50
Now as he drives, she drapes herself against his shoulder. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS423
01:05:36,00 --> 01:05:42,50
At a box office, she holds him tight and stares up at his face. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS424
01:05:47,00 --> 01:05:51,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> gives a childish nod. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS425
01:05:50,00 --> 01:05:56,50
Paying, he struggles to reach the money past her grasping figure. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS426
01:05:54,00 --> 01:06:00,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> takes the tickets. As they leave Grauman's Egyptian 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS427
01:05:57,00 --> 01:06:02,50
she points at a star on the Walk of Fame. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS428
01:06:02,00 --> 01:06:08,50
Hand in hand, they arrive at a crowded street corner. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS429
01:06:06,00 --> 01:06:13,50
Crossing the street, SOMEONE<Calvin> lets go of SOMEONE's<Ruby's> hand to answer his phone. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS430
01:06:35,00 --> 01:06:41,50
Reaching the other side, he looks around worriedly and ends the call. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS431
01:06:40,00 --> 01:06:47,50
He scans the busy intersection, finding no sign of his clingy paramour. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS432
01:06:47,00 --> 01:06:52,50
He paces the corner. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS433
01:06:50,00 --> 01:06:55,50
Turning, he halts and calls across the busy street. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS434
01:06:54,00 --> 01:07:01,50
She stands at the other side of the crosswalk watching him forlornly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS435
01:06:58,00 --> 01:07:04,50
As the signal changes, SOMEONE<Calvin> hurries back to her. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS437
01:07:26,00 --> 01:07:32,50
Back at home. SOMEONE<Calvin> rubs her back as she lies curled up on the bed. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS438
01:07:38,00 --> 01:07:46,50
In his home office, SOMEONE<Calvin> slips the bottom page out from under his manuscript and feeds it into the carriage. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS439
01:07:44,00 --> 01:07:49,50
Glancing anxiously toward the hallway. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS440
01:07:46,00 --> 01:07:55,50
He positions the page then types, SOMEONE<Ruby> was filled with the most effervescent SOMEONE<joy>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS443
01:07:55,00 --> 01:08:02,50
Later, he brings a glass of water to the bedroom and halts. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS444
01:08:01,00 --> 01:08:06,50
With a girlish grin, SOMEONE<Ruby> bounces giddily on the bed. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS445
01:08:08,00 --> 01:08:14,50
She moves into a curled shoulder stand and jiggles. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS446
01:08:12,00 --> 01:08:18,50
Now in the pool, she plays manically with SOMEONE<Susie> and SOMEONE<Myles>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS447
01:08:17,00 --> 01:08:25,50
She waves up at a patio where SOMEONE<Calvin> brings his brother a beer. SOMEONE<Harry> cooks meat on a grill. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS448
01:08:39,00 --> 01:08:43,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> glances toward SOMEONE<Ruby>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS449
01:08:42,00 --> 01:08:46,50
He frowns shamefully. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS450
01:08:43,00 --> 01:08:49,50
SOMEONE<Harry> stares at his brother then looks down at SOMEONE<Ruby>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS451
01:09:31,00 --> 01:09:38,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> giddily kicks up a splash of water. Both men glance down at her. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS452
01:09:35,00 --> 01:09:40,50
SOMEONE<Harry> raises his beer to his lips. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS453
01:09:52,00 --> 01:09:57,50
SOMEONE<Harry> returns his sober gaze to the grill. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS454
01:09:55,00 --> 01:10:01,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> stares at his brother then looks down at the pool with a thoughtful smile. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS455
01:09:59,00 --> 01:10:05,50
Now, SOMEONE<Ruby> drums spoons on the kitchen counter. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS456
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:09,50
As SOMEONE<Calvin> looks on, she tiptoes back and forth over the kitchen tiles. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS457
01:10:06,00 --> 01:10:12,50
Then playfully drops the spoons into the dishwasher. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS458
01:10:15,00 --> 01:10:21,50
She faces him with a silly vapid grin. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS459
01:10:44,00 --> 01:10:50,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> joins her hands and smiles excitedly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS460
01:10:47,00 --> 01:10:53,50
Regarding her with a sad worried gaze. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS461
01:10:50,00 --> 01:10:56,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> steps closer and cups her face in his hands. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS462
01:11:00,00 --> 01:11:05,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> raises her arms over her head. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS463
01:11:02,00 --> 01:11:08,50
Now, words type out on a page. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS466
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:16,50
Seated before his typewriter, SOMEONE<Calvin> lowers his hands to his lap. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS467
01:11:13,00 --> 01:11:18,50
He lifts his gaze and takes a calming breath. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS469
01:11:18,00 --> 01:11:24,50
Now during the day, SOMEONE<Ruby> sprawls on the couch in her pajamas. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS470
01:11:23,00 --> 01:11:30,50
Half-eaten snacks litter the coffee table and a blanket covers her feet. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS471
01:11:27,00 --> 01:11:32,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> hurries in with dry cleaning. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS472
01:11:52,00 --> 01:12:00,50
She turns the TV back on and throws down the remote. SOMEONE<Calvin> starts toward the couch. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS473
01:11:57,00 --> 01:12:03,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> snatches the remote back up and curls around it protectively. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS474
01:12:01,00 --> 01:12:08,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> takes in her unstable state then sets down the dry cleaning. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS475
01:12:05,00 --> 01:12:12,50
As he sits beside her on the couch, SOMEONE<Ruby> turns off the TV. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS476
01:12:09,00 --> 01:12:16,50
She chucks the remote aside then sits up sucking in her lips remorsefully. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS477
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:23,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> sits with his hands on his knees, staring with a furrowed brow. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS478
01:12:29,00 --> 01:12:35,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> folds his hands and looks away. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS479
01:12:44,00 --> 01:12:49,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> faces her and swallows. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS480
01:12:59,00 --> 01:13:03,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> looks to SOMEONE<Calvin> hopefully. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS481
01:13:03,00 --> 01:13:11,50
Now in a large house with walls of exposed stone, SOMEONE<Langdon> dances awkwardly among his chatting guests. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS482
01:13:10,00 --> 01:13:15,50
Three guests arrive. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS483
01:13:29,00 --> 01:13:33,50
SOMEONE<Cyrus> pulls SOMEONE<Calvin> away. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS484
01:13:31,00 --> 01:13:38,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> stares then swaps awkward smiles with Saskia. In a group. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS485
01:13:52,00 --> 01:14:00,50
Clutching her drink, SOMEONE<Ruby> wanders the party and sighs. She spies SOMEONE<Langdon> with a woman. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS486
01:14:01,00 --> 01:14:07,50
Looking pass the woman, he notices SOMEONE<Ruby> drinking on her own. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS487
01:14:05,00 --> 01:14:13,50
She meets his gaze and he raises his champagne flute. With the movie producers. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS488
01:14:40,00 --> 01:14:46,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> runs into a blonde young woman as she steps out of the bathroom. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS489
01:14:46,00 --> 01:14:51,50
He stares at her then averts his gaze. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS490
01:15:09,00 --> 01:15:14,50
A guy passes between them. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS491
01:15:22,00 --> 01:15:27,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> nods. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS492
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:34,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> averts his gaze. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS493
01:15:32,00 --> 01:15:37,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Ruby> dips her toes in a swimming pool. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS494
01:15:36,00 --> 01:15:41,50
SOMEONE<Langdon> stands across the water. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS495
01:16:12,00 --> 01:16:16,50
SOMEONE<Langdon> approaches her. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS496
01:16:34,00 --> 01:16:39,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> meets his gaze. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS498
01:17:21,00 --> 01:17:25,50
SOMEONE<Lila> holds his gaze. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS499
01:17:23,00 --> 01:17:27,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> glances aside. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS500
01:17:40,00 --> 01:17:44,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> nods. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS501
01:17:43,00 --> 01:17:48,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> glances aside. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS502
01:17:48,00 --> 01:17:53,50
Standing in the pool, SOMEONE<Langdon> covers his eyes. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS503
01:18:01,00 --> 01:18:06,50
As SOMEONE<Ruby> takes off her dress, SOMEONE<Langdon> peeks. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS504
01:18:05,00 --> 01:18:12,50
Searching for his girlfriend, SOMEONE<Calvin> heads down a hallway to a backdoor. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS505
01:18:27,00 --> 01:18:33,50
Slack-jawed, SOMEONE<Calvin> looks at SOMEONE<Ruby>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS506
01:18:31,00 --> 01:18:37,50
Now, SOMEONE<Calvin> and SOMEONE<Ruby> speed home in the convertible. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS507
01:18:38,00 --> 01:18:43,50
In the house, SOMEONE<Calvin> turns on the light. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS508
01:18:47,00 --> 01:18:51,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> grabs SOMEONE's<Ruby's> arm. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS509
01:18:58,00 --> 01:19:05,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> follows her into the bedroom and SOMEONE<Scotty> goes downstairs. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS510
01:19:55,00 --> 01:20:00,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> brushes pass him. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS511
01:19:57,00 --> 01:20:03,50
She takes off her dress then puts on another outfit. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS512
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:33,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> ambles past SOMEONE<Ruby>. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS513
01:20:31,00 --> 01:20:40,50
She watches him cross the upper floor then lowers her frustrated gaze and feels her brow with both hands. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS514
01:20:40,00 --> 01:20:45,50
In the office, SOMEONE<Calvin> switches on a desk lamp. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS515
01:20:43,00 --> 01:20:49,50
He takes off his jacket and drapes it over the back of the chair. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS516
01:20:47,00 --> 01:20:54,50
Lifting the typewriter, he grabs the key to the desk drawer hidden underneath. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS517
01:20:56,00 --> 01:21:02,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> grabs an article of clothing from a hanger and packs a bag. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS518
01:21:01,00 --> 01:21:06,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> adds a page to the typewriter. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS519
01:21:04,00 --> 01:21:10,50
He cranks a knob on the side of the typewriter's carriage. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS520
01:21:08,00 --> 01:21:15,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> faces him, dressed to leave with her bag slung over her shoulder. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS521
01:21:14,00 --> 01:21:18,50
He slides the carriage. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS522
01:21:19,00 --> 01:21:23,50
He pulls in his chair. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS523
01:21:26,00 --> 01:21:31,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> watches him type. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS524
01:21:30,00 --> 01:21:35,50
He finishes a line and slides the carriage. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS525
01:21:38,00 --> 01:21:44,50
On her way out, SOMEONE<Ruby> bumps into an invisible wall. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS526
01:21:42,00 --> 01:21:46,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> flinches. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS527
01:21:50,00 --> 01:21:55,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> shakes his head softly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS528
01:21:54,00 --> 01:22:00,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> gathers herself and tries to walk out again. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS529
01:21:59,00 --> 01:22:04,50
She covers her face with her hands. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS530
01:22:08,00 --> 01:22:15,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> lowers his gaze, SOMEONE<Ruby> grabs her handbag and marches out once more. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS531
01:22:18,00 --> 01:22:27,50
Standing, SOMEONE<Calvin> offers her the page. SOMEONE<Ruby> glances aside then crosses to the desk and takes the page from his hand. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS532
01:22:27,00 --> 01:22:32,50
With tears in her eyes she reads. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS533
01:22:45,00 --> 01:22:50,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> hands her the manuscript. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS534
01:23:49,00 --> 01:23:53,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> deflates. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS535
01:23:52,00 --> 01:23:57,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> lowers his gaze and shakes his head. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS536
01:23:55,00 --> 01:23:59,50
He clutches his brow. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS537
01:23:56,00 --> 01:24:02,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> covers her face with her hands and glances aside. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS538
01:24:00,00 --> 01:24:05,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> adds a page to the typewriter. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS541
01:24:26,00 --> 01:24:31,50
A startled SOMEONE<Ruby> glances around. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS543
01:24:32,00 --> 01:24:36,50
She covers her mouth. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS547
01:24:45,00 --> 01:24:50,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> crosses to the desk and looks at the page. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS548
01:24:48,00 --> 01:24:53,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> watches her stagger back. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS553
01:25:05,00 --> 01:25:13,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> writes, SOMEONE<Ruby> snaps. And she notices her snapping fingers. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS555
01:25:12,00 --> 01:25:17,50
She starts to panic. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS559
01:25:20,00 --> 01:25:25,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> writes, SOMEONE<Ruby> strips and sings. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS560
01:25:23,00 --> 01:25:27,50
He slides the carriage. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS561
01:25:31,00 --> 01:25:37,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> watches SOMEONE<Ruby> strip out of her cardigan. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS564
01:25:43,00 --> 01:25:48,50
Acting like a dog, she crawls across the floor. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS565
01:25:47,00 --> 01:25:53,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> watches her pick up a book with her teeth and fling it. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS566
01:25:53,00 --> 01:25:58,50
She backs up to a bookshelf bearing her teeth. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS567
01:26:00,00 --> 01:26:06,50
Grimacing, SOMEONE<Calvin> types, I'll never leave you. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS568
01:26:04,00 --> 01:26:09,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> rises to her feet and flails wildly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS574
01:26:36,00 --> 01:26:41,50
She jumps up then waves her arms over head. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS575
01:26:38,00 --> 01:26:44,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> watches her, his mouth hanging open. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS576
01:26:41,00 --> 01:26:48,50
Tilting his head back and grinning, he pounds the desk with both hands. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS577
01:26:48,00 --> 01:26:55,50
The typewriter bounces, jostling the sentence's period. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS578
01:26:52,00 --> 01:26:58,50
Hanging his head, SOMEONE<Calvin> pounds the desk even harder. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS579
01:27:01,00 --> 01:27:07,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> collapses and SOMEONE<Calvin> hunches over his desk. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS580
01:27:08,00 --> 01:27:13,50
The writer drops his head on the typewriter. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS581
01:27:13,00 --> 01:27:20,50
With SOMEONE<Ruby> still on the floor, hidden by a low wall and SOMEONE<Calvin> still hunched over his desk. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS582
01:27:18,00 --> 01:27:23,50
Our view lingers on the open air office. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS583
01:27:24,00 --> 01:27:30,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> lifts his head and metal type bars fall back into place. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS584
01:27:28,00 --> 01:27:33,50
Two of them bearing the upside down  letters D and G. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS585
01:27:32,00 --> 01:27:37,50
The wide-eyed author looks up from his typewriter. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS586
01:27:34,00 --> 01:27:40,50
And sees SOMEONE<Ruby> on the floor in front of his desk. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS587
01:27:41,00 --> 01:27:48,50
Breathing heavily, SOMEONE<Ruby> lies on her side with her arm covering her face. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS588
01:27:45,00 --> 01:27:51,50
Our view moves down her body to her feet. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS589
01:27:48,00 --> 01:27:54,50
Finding her ankles crossed over the hardwood floor. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS590
01:27:55,00 --> 01:28:01,50
His jaw hanging slack, SOMEONE<Calvin> steps over to her. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS592
01:28:03,00 --> 01:28:08,50
He crouches at her side. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS593
01:28:13,00 --> 01:28:20,50
Planting his palms on the floor. SOMEONE<Calvin> reaches to SOMEONE<Ruby> but she pops up and dashes off to the bedroom. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS594
01:28:18,00 --> 01:28:24,50
He stares in her direction. His hair mussed and his jaw slack. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS595
01:28:24,00 --> 01:28:32,50
Taking shallow breaths, he remains frozen in place. His gaze unwavering. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS596
01:28:33,00 --> 01:28:39,50
The young man closes his eyes momentarily. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS597
01:28:36,00 --> 01:28:41,50
Then returns his attention to the bedroom. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS598
01:28:40,00 --> 01:28:47,50
Now, the typewriter hammers out a string of letters on a new page. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS603
01:28:59,00 --> 01:29:04,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> slides the carriage and starts a new line. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS606
01:29:13,00 --> 01:29:18,50
The carriage slides to another new line. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS607
01:29:16,00 --> 01:29:22,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> looks up from the page and peers in SOMEONE's<Ruby's> direction. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS608
01:29:19,00 --> 01:29:25,50
The typewriter's guide frames the beginning of the new line. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS610
01:29:28,00 --> 01:29:33,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> lowers his gaze and adds a final word. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS612
01:29:41,00 --> 01:29:48,50
Now, SOMEONE<Calvin> scribbles on a sticky note attached to his manuscript. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS613
01:29:45,00 --> 01:29:50,50
SOMEONE<Ruby>, look at the last page. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS615
01:29:58,00 --> 01:30:04,50
He withdraws his hand from the note, peers toward the bedroom. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS616
01:30:01,00 --> 01:30:07,50
Then holds his manuscript close. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS617
01:30:04,00 --> 01:30:08,50
Clutching it with both hands. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS618
01:30:09,00 --> 01:30:13,50
Now, outside the bedroom. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS619
01:30:10,00 --> 01:30:17,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> bends over and sets his manuscript before the closed door. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS620
01:30:20,00 --> 01:30:27,50
Without standing upright, SOMEONE<Calvin> braces himself on the walls and creeps downstairs. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS621
01:30:25,00 --> 01:30:32,50
Our lingering view lowers to the manuscript and its attached note. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS622
01:30:36,00 --> 01:30:42,50
The next morning, SOMEONE<Calvin> lies asleep on his side. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS623
01:30:39,00 --> 01:30:45,50
Still wearing his glasses and clothes from the night before, As SOMEONE lick his ear. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS625
01:30:44,00 --> 01:30:50,50
The young man awakens to find himself on the couch. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS626
01:30:50,00 --> 01:30:55,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> sits up, his hair disheveled. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS627
01:30:52,00 --> 01:30:57,50
He rises to his feet. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS628
01:30:56,00 --> 01:31:02,50
SOMEONE<Scotty> watches him approach the foot of the stairs, pause. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS629
01:31:00,00 --> 01:31:04,50
Then head up to the second floor. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS630
01:31:04,00 --> 01:31:12,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> peeks over the top of the staircase and spots his manuscript on the floor outside the bedroom. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS631
01:31:12,00 --> 01:31:19,50
As he approaches it, the stack of pages comes into focus. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS632
01:31:16,00 --> 01:31:21,50
Revealing the sticky note now gone. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS633
01:31:20,00 --> 01:31:28,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> crouches over the manuscript, letting the backs of his fingers rest on the top page. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS634
01:31:25,00 --> 01:31:30,50
He picks up the stack as he stands upright. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS635
01:31:29,00 --> 01:31:35,50
Hesitating, he enters the bedroom and steps around a corner. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS636
01:31:34,00 --> 01:31:40,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> stop short and finding SOMEONE<Ruby> gone. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS637
01:31:37,00 --> 01:31:42,50
Her artwork now missing from the headboard. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS638
01:31:41,00 --> 01:31:50,50
He steps into the closet, stares at the bare shelves then collapses to his knees and bows his head to the floor. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS639
01:31:57,00 --> 01:32:01,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> topples on his side. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS640
01:31:59,00 --> 01:32:05,50
Later, he lies in the dark clutching the manuscript. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS641
01:32:03,00 --> 01:32:09,50
SOMEONE<Harry> comes upstairs to find his brother lying on the floor. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS642
01:32:09,00 --> 01:32:17,50
He switches on a light then crouches over SOMEONE<Calvin>, feeling his brother's head and shoulders. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS643
01:32:22,00 --> 01:32:27,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> sits up a bit. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS644
01:32:27,00 --> 01:32:32,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> drops to the floor again. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS645
01:32:31,00 --> 01:32:37,50
SOMEONE<Harry> remains at his brother's side, consoling him. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS646
01:32:39,00 --> 01:32:45,50
As our view lingers on the brothers, the image gradually fades to black. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS647
01:32:47,00 --> 01:32:53,50
Now, a golf ball sits on a bed of tall grass. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS648
01:32:50,00 --> 01:32:58,50
A golf club touches down beside it as SOMEONE<Calvin> prepares to hit the ball out of the rough. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS649
01:32:55,00 --> 01:32:59,50
SOMEONE<Harry> stands by. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS650
01:32:58,00 --> 01:33:03,50
They watch the ball head for a green. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS651
01:33:07,00 --> 01:33:11,50
Later, they walk the fairway. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS652
01:33:43,00 --> 01:33:51,50
Now in his home office, SOMEONE<Calvin> lays a clear plastic cover over his typewriter. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS653
01:33:50,00 --> 01:33:56,50
He lifts the typewriter off the desk and sets it aside. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS654
01:33:56,00 --> 01:34:03,50
Sitting at the desk, he opens a laptop and stares at its screen. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS655
01:34:01,00 --> 01:34:05,50
Standing at a window. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS656
01:34:02,00 --> 01:34:07,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> overlooks his swimming pool. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS657
01:34:05,00 --> 01:34:10,50
At the beach, he and SOMEONE<Scotty> approach a lifeguard house. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS658
01:34:08,00 --> 01:34:14,50
At night, he writes using his laptop. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS659
01:34:32,00 --> 01:34:36,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> sits in Mort's chair. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS660
01:34:46,00 --> 01:34:51,50
He feeds SOMEONE<Scotty> some of his food. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS661
01:34:56,00 --> 01:35:03,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> opens his new book, The Girlfriend. A dedication page reads For Her. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS662
01:35:00,00 --> 01:35:04,50
At a bookstore reading. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS663
01:35:29,00 --> 01:35:34,50
SOMEONE's<Calvin's> family are among the crowd. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS664
01:35:48,00 --> 01:35:52,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> looks up from his book. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS665
01:35:54,00 --> 01:36:00,50
A large audience surrounds a single tree standing in the middle of the store. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS666
01:35:58,00 --> 01:36:03,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> shifts his humble gaze. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS667
01:36:00,00 --> 01:36:05,50
Later, Cyrus chats with SOMEONE's<Calvin's> family. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS668
01:36:18,00 --> 01:36:23,50
Now Dr. Rosenthal holds a copy of the book. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS669
01:37:03,00 --> 01:37:08,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> draws a breath and nods softly. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS670
01:37:05,00 --> 01:37:11,50
Now, SOMEONE<Calvin> and SOMEONE<Scotty> walk through a park. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS671
01:37:12,00 --> 01:37:16,50
The unleashed dog runs off. 

RUBY_SPARKS_DVS672
01:37:17,00 --> 01:37:21,50
SOMEONE<Calvin> runs after him.
