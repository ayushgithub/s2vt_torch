SALT_DVS17
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:50,50
American border MPs exchange a North Korean man for the blonde woman and her escort. 

SALT_DVS18
00:03:13,00 --> 00:03:19,50
He nods toward an unshaven man. 

SALT_DVS19
00:03:18,00 --> 00:03:23,50
He hurries toward the border. 

SALT_DVS20
00:03:29,00 --> 00:03:38,50
The blonde woman gazes stoically at the unshaven man. Her colleague glances at her, his brow arched. 

SALT_DVS21
00:03:38,00 --> 00:03:50,50
As they pass the South Korean soldiers at the raised barricade, she blinks tearfully. The unshaven man takes a step forward his expression inscrutable. 

SALT_DVS22
00:03:52,00 --> 00:04:37,50
She strides toward the civilian who stares anxiously at her injured face. Jagged geometric pieces of the image separate from each other like shards of glass. The central pieces slide together and form a title as the picture around them fades to black. Salt. Now pedestrians pass a high-rise apartment building. Words appear, Washington D. C. present day. In an apartment, the civilian works at a kitchen table, his cheeks now smoothly shaven. A scruffy dog yawns in a dog bed behind him. The blonde peeks at the man from around the doorway. Her sultry eyes study him lovingly from above her high cheekbones and pouty lips. On the table, a tarantula climbs up the wall of a terrarium. The man looks up at the woman and smiles. 

SALT_DVS23
00:04:42,00 --> 00:04:47,50
She pours a mug of coffee. 

SALT_DVS25
00:04:58,00 --> 00:05:07,50
The dog eyes her as she hugs her husband from behind then leans over his shoulder and kisses him on his lips and forehead. 

SALT_DVS27
00:05:13,00 --> 00:05:21,50
Now in her cubical at Rink Petroleum, the blonde woman watches an instructional video. 

SALT_DVS28
00:05:28,00 --> 00:05:33,50
Her colleague steps up. 

SALT_DVS29
00:05:42,00 --> 00:05:48,50
She shows a folded paper napkin. 

SALT_DVS30
00:06:26,00 --> 00:06:31,50
Later, they head through the lobby. 

SALT_DVS31
00:06:54,00 --> 00:07:00,50
A security monitor shows their names, SOMEONE<Salt> and SOMEONE<Winter>. 

SALT_DVS33
00:07:25,00 --> 00:07:34,50
They rescan their IDs and pass back through the security gate. Now in a hallway, all three approach two other men. 

SALT_DVS35
00:07:44,00 --> 00:07:52,50
Drop their cellphones in a metal box and enter an observation area overlooking an interrogation room. 

SALT_DVS37
00:07:55,00 --> 00:08:00,50
SOMEONE<Salt> watches him closely. 

SALT_DVS38
00:07:58,00 --> 00:08:03,50
A monitor shows his brain activity. 

SALT_DVS40
00:08:11,00 --> 00:08:23,50
SOMEONE<Salt> picks up a pack of cigarettes and an ashtray then inserts a small radio receiver into her ear. She adjusts it outside the interrogation room. 

SALT_DVS41
00:08:21,00 --> 00:08:26,50
She heads through the door. 

SALT_DVS42
00:08:27,00 --> 00:08:34,50
She places the ashtray and cigarettes on the table beside the defector then takes a seat opposite. 

SALT_DVS43
00:08:33,00 --> 00:08:38,50
The grizzled, middle-aged Russian notes her diamond wedding ring. 

SALT_DVS45
00:08:59,00 --> 00:09:03,50
He locks her sunken eyes on her. 

SALT_DVS50
00:10:01,00 --> 00:10:06,50
SOMEONE<Orlov> leans toward her. 

SALT_DVS51
00:10:05,00 --> 00:10:10,50
Subtitles - I came here to tell you a story. 

SALT_DVS52
00:10:09,00 --> 00:10:13,50
I don't like stories. 

SALT_DVS55
00:11:01,00 --> 00:11:06,50
The Soviet couple peers down at us sobbing. 

SALT_DVS56
00:11:07,00 --> 00:11:15,50
In a hospital corridor, SOMEONE<Anya> clutches SOMEONE<Sasha> inconsolably. 

SALT_DVS58
00:11:19,00 --> 00:11:29,50
An image of flowers lying on a tiny grave dissolves into a helicopter soaring over a dreary river dotted with eyelets. 

SALT_DVS59
00:11:34,00 --> 00:11:38,50
He wears a ring. 

SALT_DVS60
00:11:48,00 --> 00:11:52,50
The chopper arrives at a fortress. 

SALT_DVS61
00:12:56,00 --> 00:13:01,50
The children kiss his ring. 

SALT_DVS63
00:13:11,00 --> 00:13:16,50
A boy's hand shoots up. 

SALT_DVS64
00:13:15,00 --> 00:13:23,50
A child with a scarred cheek raises his hand. The spymaster whips him savagely. Back in the present. 

SALT_DVS68
00:14:47,00 --> 00:14:52,50
SOMEONE<Orlov> gives a slow nod. 

SALT_DVS69
00:15:01,00 --> 00:15:06,50
SOMEONE<Salt> gives an amused smile. 

SALT_DVS71
00:15:27,00 --> 00:15:33,50
In the observation room, SOMEONE<Peabody> and SOMEONE<Winter> look up sharply. 

SALT_DVS72
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:51,50
SOMEONE<Salt> storms out of the interrogation and into the observation room. 

SALT_DVS73
00:15:49,00 --> 00:15:57,50
SOMEONE<Winter> glances at SOMEONE<Peabody> who gapes at her. SOMEONE<Salt> eyes her colleagues worriedly then strides forward

SALT_DVS74
00:16:12,00 --> 00:16:17,50
into the hall and retrieves her cellphone from the metal box. 

SALT_DVS76
00:17:03,00 --> 00:17:11,50
He gestures toward the interrogation room. 

SALT_DVS77
00:17:10,00 --> 00:17:16,50
SOMEONE<Winter> ushers the blonde agent into the now vacant room. 

SALT_DVS78
00:17:16,00 --> 00:17:32,50
He shuts the door and faces SOMEONE<Peabody>. In the interrogation room, SOMEONE<Salt> paces. Through a window she observes the two men conversing animatedly in the hall. 

SALT_DVS81
00:17:38,00 --> 00:17:54,50
Now a green light briefly flashes red. The CIA officer and a security escort lead SOMEONE<Orlov> through a door and into a hallway. At an elevator, the CIA officer waves his ID card in front of a scanner and hits a call button. 

SALT_DVS82
00:17:54,00 --> 00:17:58,50
Enter it and the doors close. 

SALT_DVS84
00:18:17,00 --> 00:18:22,50
And brutally with the blade. Meanwhile. 

SALT_DVS85
00:18:24,00 --> 00:18:29,50
SOMEONE<Salt> paces in the interrogation room. 

SALT_DVS86
00:18:28,00 --> 00:18:32,50
In the hallway. 

SALT_DVS87
00:18:36,00 --> 00:18:48,50
SOMEONE<Salt> sees a security officer speaking with SOMEONE<Winter> and SOMEONE<Peabody>. As the men hurry out of sight, she fidgets. She checks her cell then slides it shut and shifts her eyes around the sparse room. 

SALT_DVS88
00:18:48,00 --> 00:18:53,50
With her as she anxiously taps her phone against her hand. 

SALT_DVS89
00:18:50,00 --> 00:18:59,50
With her back to the door, she sits on the edge of the table. A flashing red light pulses through the window from the hallway. 

SALT_DVS91
00:19:11,00 --> 00:19:18,50
She looks up at a security camera in the corner and snaps her fingers. 

SALT_DVS92
00:19:16,00 --> 00:19:25,50
Now SOMEONE<Peabody> and SOMEONE<Winter> enter a security hub where a monitor shows SOMEONE<Orlov> in the elevator shooting his victims in the head. 

SALT_DVS93
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:38,50
She shows a photo. 

SALT_DVS95
00:19:50,00 --> 00:19:56,50
A monitor shows SOMEONE<Salt> in the hallway. 

SALT_DVS98
00:20:08,00 --> 00:20:12,50
SOMEONE<Salt> abruptly turns away. 

SALT_DVS100
00:20:23,00 --> 00:20:28,50
The security camera catches her. 

SALT_DVS103
00:20:35,00 --> 00:20:40,50
It's blocked. SOMEONE<Peabody> turns to his aide. 

SALT_DVS106
00:20:51,00 --> 00:21:03,50
SOMEONE<Winter> scowls at the security monitors. Now more panels merge close, cutting SOMEONE<Salt> off. She turns down another corridor. Back in the security hub. 

SALT_DVS107
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:09,50
Control panel by the elevator blinks off as SOMEONE<Salt> approaches. She glances up at a security camera. 

SALT_DVS108
00:21:13,00 --> 00:21:19,50
She sprays it with a fire extinguisher. 

SALT_DVS110
00:21:22,00 --> 00:21:28,50
As SOMEONE<Peabody> exits, SOMEONE<Winter> glances at the security officer. 

SALT_DVS112
00:21:33,00 --> 00:21:38,50
SOMEONE<Winter> eyes a series of monitors. 

SALT_DVS113
00:21:38,00 --> 00:21:50,50
Now SOMEONE<Salt> idly spins the wheels of an upturned office chair as she looks through a glass wall into another corridor. She heads over. A monitor shows her approaching. 

SALT_DVS114
00:21:48,00 --> 00:21:57,50
SOMEONE<Salt> sprays the camera then searches bottles on a cart of cleaning supplies. In the security hub. 

SALT_DVS116
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:07,50
SOMEONE<Salt> heads into a room with the fire extinguisher and some bottles of cleaning solutions. 

SALT_DVS117
00:22:06,00 --> 00:22:26,50
SOMEONE<Salt> opens a janitorial closet and removes a bottle from a cabinet. As the overhead lights flicker on, she glances up at a camera. She slides off her panties and uses them to cover its lens. Then tips over a table and unscrews one of its metal legs. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Peabody> reads her file. 

SALT_DVS118
00:22:25,00 --> 00:22:48,50
Covert Operations. Division: Russia. Current Cover: Vice President of Products and Development, Rink Petroleum. Special Skills: Close quarter combat, applied explosive techniques. Parents killed in car accident, December 24th, 1988. After release from North Korea, married German national SOMEONE<Michael> Krause. 

SALT_DVS119
00:22:47,00 --> 00:22:52,50
In the security hub, SOMEONE<Winter> makes a call. 

SALT_DVS122
00:23:09,00 --> 00:23:16,50
She pours cleaning solutions into a trashcan. The TAC team reaches a security barrier. 

SALT_DVS124
00:23:23,00 --> 00:23:27,50
Desk chair. Outside the room. 

SALT_DVS128
00:23:59,00 --> 00:24:04,50
The tactical team prepares to storm the room. 

SALT_DVS129
00:24:03,00 --> 00:24:09,50
Wearing a mask, SOMEONE<Peabody> nods to a team member. 

SALT_DVS130
00:24:10,00 --> 00:24:20,50
Pulls the pin from a gas canister. Hiding behind a corner, SOMEONE<Salt> peeks around at the sealed interrogation room doors. 

SALT_DVS131
00:24:22,00 --> 00:24:26,50
As the doors slide open 

SALT_DVS132
00:24:27,00 --> 00:24:31,50
SOMEONE<Salt> takes out the tactical team. 

SALT_DVS134
00:24:40,00 --> 00:24:44,50
Gun a window shattering its glass pane. 

SALT_DVS137
00:24:53,00 --> 00:24:58,50
A security feed shows SOMEONE<Salt> outside the building. 

SALT_DVS138
00:24:59,00 --> 00:25:13,50
She races barefoot in front of traffic. As she darts past a bus stop, some of the waiting commuters stare after her. Slowing briefly, SOMEONE<Salt> glances back at the Rink Petroleum building. In the security hub. 

SALT_DVS140
00:25:20,00 --> 00:25:27,50
A window shows SOMEONE<Peabody> tossing down his bulletproof vest as he returns. 

SALT_DVS143
00:25:39,00 --> 00:25:45,50
Waving her hand, SOMEONE<Salt> flags down a Beltway cab and climbs in back. 

SALT_DVS146
00:25:58,00 --> 00:26:05,50
SOMEONE<Salt> removes the SIM card from her phone and repeatedly bends it in half. 

SALT_DVS147
00:26:04,00 --> 00:26:15,50
The taxi driver eyes her suspiciously in his rear view mirror as she destroys it. Glancing up, she catches him watching and he quickly looks away. 

SALT_DVS148
00:26:13,00 --> 00:26:25,50
She tosses the SIM card on the floor. Shutting her eyes, she gently pounds the back of her head against the seat back then recalls SOMEONE<Winter> showing her photographs of SOMEONE<Mike>. 

SALT_DVS151
00:26:35,00 --> 00:26:40,50
He hands her SOMEONE's<Mike's> book on Spiders. 

SALT_DVS153
00:26:51,00 --> 00:26:55,50
To the high-rise. 

SALT_DVS154
00:26:54,00 --> 00:27:17,50
Now inside the building, an elevator's door slide open and SOMEONE<Salt> peeks into a hallway. She scurries to her apartment door where she slides a hidden key from the frame. As she enters the apartment, she grabs a tan overcoat from the hall and puts it on. Creeping to the living room, she pauses in a doorway to pick up a pair of boots. She carries them in her hands as she searches the apartment. 

SALT_DVS155
00:27:20,00 --> 00:27:26,50
She passes a framed photo of the couple embracing. 

SALT_DVS156
00:27:26,00 --> 00:27:31,50
Her gaze swivels from a hallway to the vacant living room. 

SALT_DVS157
00:27:30,00 --> 00:27:35,50
SOMEONE<Bert> runs over and she pats him. 

SALT_DVS159
00:27:39,00 --> 00:27:54,50
SOMEONE<Salt> watches as SOMEONE<Bert> scurries to an overturned chair. On a table beside it, she spots a half-eaten sandwich and an unfinished beer. SOMEONE<Bert> wags his tail expectantly as SOMEONE<Salt> hurries to an adjacent room. 

SALT_DVS160
00:27:52,00 --> 00:27:58,50
Outside, agents flood out of vehicles and head toward the building. 

SALT_DVS161
00:27:56,00 --> 00:28:04,50
Apartment, SOMEONE<Salt> lowers a panel from the underside of a table, revealing a hidden gun. She grabs it. 

SALT_DVS162
00:28:02,00 --> 00:28:10,50
her chest, finding a backpack, she slings it over her shoulder then jerks her gaze to the door. 

SALT_DVS163
00:28:11,00 --> 00:28:15,50
SOMEONE<Bert> scampers over. 

SALT_DVS164
00:28:13,00 --> 00:28:21,50
He follows her down a hall and into a dark room. Meanwhile, the tactical team arrives on her floor with their guns drawn. 

SALT_DVS169
00:29:01,00 --> 00:29:09,50
Using a bust statuette, he knocks away the remaining glass. On the wall just outside, SOMEONE<Salt> climbs. 

SALT_DVS170
00:29:08,00 --> 00:29:16,50
She grabs an air conditioning unit and crosses to its other side. As SOMEONE<Peabody> leans out the window. 

SALT_DVS171
00:29:14,00 --> 00:29:25,50
Presses her back to the wall, hiding behind the air conditioner. He sweeps his gaze over the U-shaped courtyard then looks to the ground roughly ten stories below. 

SALT_DVS172
00:29:27,00 --> 00:29:38,50
Stretches her leg across a cornered gap to another windowsill. Hugging the wall, she sidesteps to the next window. Her toes deftly feeling for its latch. 

SALT_DVS173
00:29:40,00 --> 00:29:50,50
Now she reaches a window of a fire escape. Peeking inside, she sees a young girl in headphones doing homework at a table. 

SALT_DVS174
00:29:48,00 --> 00:29:59,50
SOMEONE<Salt> waves at her oblivious neighbor. As the young girl shifts her gaze, she notices the woman outside and returns the wave. SOMEONE<Salt> beckons and the girl heads over. 

SALT_DVS177
00:30:41,00 --> 00:30:47,50
She puts a pair of jeans on under her skirt. 

SALT_DVS179
00:30:51,00 --> 00:31:05,50
Her friendly smile fades as SOMEONE<Bert> catches her gaze. Staring at the dog, she remembers a butterfly soaring over SOMEONE's<Mike's> head in a pavilion filled with lush vegetation. He approaches a wandering SOMEONE<Salt>. 

SALT_DVS180
00:31:22,00 --> 00:31:27,50
He wears a mild boyish smile. 

SALT_DVS181
00:31:26,00 --> 00:31:33,50
Later, he shows her a bulbous black spider resting in a glass-encased web. 

SALT_DVS183
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:07,50
Donning glasses, SOMEONE<Mike> peers excitedly at the spider. 

SALT_DVS184
00:32:06,00 --> 00:32:14,50
SOMEONE<Salt> smiles, watching the spider pick its way up to a twig housing its web. 

SALT_DVS185
00:32:13,00 --> 00:32:22,50
Back in the present, she walks down a sidewalk, a knit cap pulled over her hair. Leaving her building, SOMEONE<Winter> spots her. 

SALT_DVS188
00:32:34,00 --> 00:32:39,50
SOMEONE<Salt> sprints away. 

SALT_DVS191
00:32:53,00 --> 00:32:59,50
SOMEONE<Salt> reaches a subway entrance and dashes down an escalator. 

SALT_DVS195
00:33:26,00 --> 00:33:30,50
Then halts at the side of an SUV. 

SALT_DVS198
00:33:46,00 --> 00:33:51,50
Now draws his gun and pursues SOMEONE<Salt> on foot. 

SALT_DVS199
00:33:55,00 --> 00:34:00,50
As another SUV arrives  

SALT_DVS203
00:34:58,00 --> 00:35:03,50
On a trailer of a passing semi with a hard bounce. 

SALT_DVS204
00:35:01,00 --> 00:35:06,50
SOMEONE<Peabody>, as he fires again. 

SALT_DVS207
00:35:35,00 --> 00:35:39,50
And two officers get out. 

SALT_DVS209
00:35:51,00 --> 00:35:56,50
Pulls herself up to a stable position then crouches and gets her bearing. 

SALT_DVS211
00:36:06,00 --> 00:36:16,50
Saw in the overpass and the agents scramble out. The tanker approaches below. Flanked by agents aiming their guns, SOMEONE<Winter> leans out toward her. 

SALT_DVS217
00:37:04,00 --> 00:37:11,50
Spies the pursuing SUV then runs off between two lanes of unmoving cars. 

SALT_DVS220
00:37:33,00 --> 00:37:37,50
And then wrenches the throttle. 

SALT_DVS221
00:37:37,00 --> 00:37:42,50
SOMEONE<Salt> speeds off between the lanes of traffic. 

SALT_DVS223
00:38:14,00 --> 00:38:19,50
She expertly stirs the motorcycle as it whisks around a vehicle. 

SALT_DVS224
00:38:18,00 --> 00:38:25,50
In the SUV, SOMEONE<Peabody> takes a few steadying breaths. 

SALT_DVS226
00:38:40,00 --> 00:38:45,50
SOMEONE<Peabody> gets a text. 

SALT_DVS227
00:38:46,00 --> 00:38:53,50
Evelyn SOMEONE<Salt> was injured during the Moscow car crash that killed her parents. 

SALT_DVS229
00:39:20,00 --> 00:39:44,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE<Salt> kicks a feminine hygiene product dispenser off the wall. It opens as it lands and she takes a pad. Facing a mirror, she unwraps it. Then lifts her bloodstained shirt to reveal a gunshot wound at the top of her hip. She applies the pad to the injury then tucks it into her waistband. Shutting her eyes, she remembers lying on top of SOMEONE<Mike> in bed. They kiss and wrestle playfully. 

SALT_DVS232
00:40:06,00 --> 00:40:12,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Salt> watches a newscast. 

SALT_DVS233
00:40:32,00 --> 00:40:40,50
She remembers riding in the back of an SUV in Korea with SOMEONE's<Mike's> concerned gaze fixed on her. 

SALT_DVS234
00:40:40,00 --> 00:40:46,50
She faces him, revealing her bruised swollen eye. 

SALT_DVS235
00:40:45,00 --> 00:40:50,50
She cheerfully shuts her eyes and shakes her head. 

SALT_DVS238
00:41:14,00 --> 00:41:18,50
She woefully meets his gaze. 

SALT_DVS245
00:42:05,00 --> 00:42:26,50
SOMEONE<Mike> gives a loving smile. Beaming tearfully, SOMEONE<Salt> rests her head against her folded hands. SOMEONE<Mike> holds her by the crook of her elbow. Taking his hand, she presses her lips to it. SOMEONE<Mike> leans close and kisses the top of her blonde head. Back in the present, SOMEONE<Salt> shifts her listless gaze. Now at a hotel's check-in desk. 

SALT_DVS246
00:42:34,00 --> 00:42:42,50
On a hallway, the housekeeping woman removes garments from a rack of laundered clothes and takes them into a guest's room. 

SALT_DVS247
00:42:43,00 --> 00:42:54,50
Passing the rack, SOMEONE<Salt> snatches a garment in each hand without breaking her stride. Now she arrives at her deluxe room with the clothes draped over her arm. 

SALT_DVS248
00:42:54,00 --> 00:43:07,50
Depositing her backpack on the bed, she moves through the space, examining it with a keen perceptive gaze. She peers into a bathroom then returns to the bedroom and removes her knit cap. 

SALT_DVS249
00:43:06,00 --> 00:43:20,50
SOMEONE<Salt> retrieves a jewelry box from a plastic bag containing cash and passports. She removes a set of false teeth from her mouth then takes out a pair of darkly tinted contact lenses from her pale blue eyes. 

SALT_DVS250
00:43:20,00 --> 00:43:25,50
Now she lays out an assortment of handguns, 

SALT_DVS251
00:43:23,00 --> 00:43:27,50
ammunition and hardware on the bed. 

SALT_DVS253
00:43:35,00 --> 00:43:41,50
She presses a button on the square component and a red light illuminates. 

SALT_DVS254
00:43:39,00 --> 00:44:13,50
Later SOMEONE<Salt> uses a needle to draw clear venom from the spider. By her open laptop, a printer ejects a page headed, Subway System Access Tunnels. A blueprint reads Detail: St. SOMEONE<Barts> Subdivision, and highlights a steam vent. Nearby, another print out bares the heading, Church Tunnels. SOMEONE<Salt> crosses to a window, pulls the drapes aside a few inches and peers out. St. Bartholomew's Cathedral stands almost directly across the street, softly illuminated by outdoor flood lamps. Gazing wistfully at it, SOMEONE<Salt> remembers swearing in as a CIA agent. 

SALT_DVS255
00:44:39,00 --> 00:44:48,50
Back in the present, she dyes her hair dark. Daytime, rooftop secret service snipers monitor a funeral procession. 

SALT_DVS258
00:45:18,00 --> 00:45:43,50
Across the street, a woman with dark brown hair looks on. As we revolve around her, we recognize SOMEONE's<Salt's> high cheekbones and bee-stung lips. At the cathedral entrance, SOMEONE<Peabody> stands between SOMEONE<Winter> and a balding man. At the curb, a secret service agent opens a car door. Matveyev gets out and solemnly looks around. SOMEONE<Salt> watches him proceed toward the entrance, flanked by a secret service detail. 

SALT_DVS259
00:45:43,00 --> 00:45:51,50
She steps away. Matveyev pauses, casting about his weary gaze. 

SALT_DVS260
00:45:51,00 --> 00:46:03,50
SOMEONE<Salt> moves through the crowd, keeping an eye on him. From the church entrance, SOMEONE<Winter> catches a glimpse of her. He narrows his eyes, trying to get a better look but she slips out of view. 

SALT_DVS262
00:46:24,00 --> 00:46:29,50
The military dress uniforms carry a flag draped casket. 

SALT_DVS263
00:46:33,00 --> 00:46:40,50
They bring the coffin to the church's entry way. Matveyev follows, flanked by his security. 

SALT_DVS264
00:46:39,00 --> 00:46:46,50
And speeds through a subway tunnel. On board, a female police officer turns. 

SALT_DVS265
00:46:46,00 --> 00:46:51,50
The fugitive pretends to read a folded newspaper. 

SALT_DVS267
00:47:03,00 --> 00:47:10,50
SOMEONE<Salt> drops the newspaper by the door and moves away as it smolders. 

SALT_DVS270
00:47:34,00 --> 00:47:46,50
Now in the cathedral, a gray-haired man plays an organ. In front of him, dozens of men and women in the choir wear white robes and hold songbooks as they sing soberly. 

SALT_DVS271
00:47:45,00 --> 00:47:52,50
In the congregation, Matveyev greets a middle-aged woman with auburn hair. 

SALT_DVS272
00:47:52,00 --> 00:47:58,50
He approaches a lanky man in a row behind her. 

SALT_DVS273
00:48:00,00 --> 00:48:08,50
The commander-in-chief moves aside, Matveyev sidles into his row and nods at the first lady. 

SALT_DVS274
00:48:07,00 --> 00:48:20,50
He eases past her and stands at her side. At the front of the cathedral, the flag draped casket lies before the apse. In front of it, a soldier in dress uniform ends a salute and marches away. 

SALT_DVS275
00:48:20,00 --> 00:48:35,50
The congregation and choir take their seats. The U. S. president kisses his wife then treads forward and tenderly lays his hand on the casket. On a mezzanine balcony, SOMEONE<Winter> gazes down on the nave as the president moves toward a podium. 

SALT_DVS276
00:48:34,00 --> 00:48:40,50
SOMEONE<Peabody> watches from a security hub in the sacristy. 

SALT_DVS277
00:48:41,00 --> 00:48:46,50
He peers into the nave. 

SALT_DVS278
00:48:47,00 --> 00:48:52,50
SOMEONE<Winter> radios in. 

SALT_DVS279
00:48:57,00 --> 00:49:03,50
SOMEONE<Salt> jogs through an access tunnel with a low ceiling. In the cathedral. 

SALT_DVS281
00:49:21,00 --> 00:49:31,50
As the steam fills a chamber beneath her, she reaches a door and peeks through its window into a hallway. Two security agents enter from another door. 

SALT_DVS282
00:49:46,00 --> 00:49:59,50
He back down. His partner attacks once more but SOMEONE<Salt> kicks him unconscious and runs off with his gun. Now Matveyev takes the podium. In a stairwell, SOMEONE<Salt> dashes up several flights. 

SALT_DVS288
00:50:38,00 --> 00:50:56,50
In the crypt, a door cracks open and SOMEONE<Salt> peeks out. She aims a tiny mirror down the hallway and spots a security agent striding up. As the man reaches for his gun, the door swings open and SOMEONE<Salt> leaps out. She boots him backward. Knees the weapon out of his hand. 

SALT_DVS289
00:50:59,00 --> 00:51:06,50
Crouching, SOMEONE<Salt> fires through the downed man, using him like a silencer. 

SALT_DVS290
00:51:06,00 --> 00:51:10,50
Nails the approaching agent in his bulletproof vest. 

SALT_DVS294
00:51:25,00 --> 00:51:45,50
Shoots another mechanism. In the cathedral, guests panic. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Peabody> draws his gun. In the crypt chamber, SOMEONE<Salt> attaches one of the detonator components to a brick of explosives. She tosses it upward and it magnetically adheres to a chandelier's base on the ceiling. In the mezzanine, SOMEONE<Winter> radios in. 

SALT_DVS296
00:52:08,00 --> 00:52:20,50
In the crypt, SOMEONE<Peabody> shines his flashlight at a dead guard. A cloud of dust fills the hallway ahead. Now in the smoke-filled organ chamber. 

SALT_DVS297
00:52:20,00 --> 00:52:29,50
SOMEONE<Salt> aims her gun through the cloud of dust and faintly glimpses Matveyev's form. She shoots him. In the hallway. 

SALT_DVS298
00:52:27,00 --> 00:52:37,50
SOMEONE<Peabody> reacts to the sound and moves toward it. In the organ chamber, his flashlight glows through the dust. Its wavering beam glares brighter and 

SALT_DVS300
00:52:44,00 --> 00:52:48,50
Her calm aim, hold steady. 

SALT_DVS301
00:52:47,00 --> 00:52:54,50
She raises her hands, aiming the gun harmlessly at the ceiling then lets it drop. 

SALT_DVS302
00:52:57,00 --> 00:53:01,50
Other agents enter. 

SALT_DVS303
00:53:10,00 --> 00:53:14,50
A supervisor radios in. 

SALT_DVS304
00:53:14,00 --> 00:53:19,50
Later outside. 

SALT_DVS305
00:53:24,00 --> 00:53:27,50
He uses his cell. 

SALT_DVS310
00:54:38,00 --> 00:54:53,50
The two men lock gazes. SOMEONE<Winter> glances quizzically after SOMEONE<Salt> and heaves a sigh. Now the three vehicle police convoy moves down a vacant city street. Later, it crosses the 59th Street Bridge. In the back seat, SOMEONE<Salt> blinks. 

SALT_DVS311
00:54:52,00 --> 00:54:58,50
Eyes. The lead cruiser veers to one side and passes a U-Haul truck. 

SALT_DVS312
00:54:57,00 --> 00:55:04,50
SOMEONE<Salt> tips her head back and studies the cruiser behind him in a rear view mirror. 

SALT_DVS313
00:55:05,00 --> 00:55:09,50
In a flashback. 

SALT_DVS314
00:55:09,00 --> 00:55:14,50
A girl enters a dormitory. 

SALT_DVS315
00:55:12,00 --> 00:55:17,50
Bandages conceal her features. 

SALT_DVS316
00:55:23,00 --> 00:55:28,50
She climbs into a bed next to SOMEONE's<Shnaider's>. 

SALT_DVS317
00:55:40,00 --> 00:55:44,50
Moonlight glows on his scarred cheek. 

SALT_DVS319
00:55:51,00 --> 00:55:56,50
One ramming his head into the window. 

SALT_DVS322
00:56:49,00 --> 00:56:53,50
SOMEONE<Salt> winces, bracing herself. 

SALT_DVS323
00:57:25,00 --> 00:57:46,50
The SUV tips and smashes down onto all four wheels. Inside, SOMEONE<Salt> steals a key ring from the driver's belt. Bystanders tread toward the passenger side of the SUV as SOMEONE<Salt> slips out the driver's side. As two men rush to help the driver, she hides and unlocks the handcuffs. Later, she strides casually away with her hands in her pockets. 

SALT_DVS324
00:57:46,00 --> 00:58:00,50
As the sleeper agent sunders pass the sidewalk vendor's hat rack, she steals an ushanka-style fur cap. Later, clouds fill the bright afternoon sky. Passengers sit calmly on a ferry. 

SALT_DVS326
00:58:05,00 --> 00:58:16,50
And her shoulders wrapped in a knee length fur lined shawl. Sunlight flares on the misty air, starkly outlining her profile against the sea and the sky. 

SALT_DVS328
00:58:53,00 --> 00:58:59,50
Bandages still cover much of her swollen face. 

SALT_DVS329
00:58:57,00 --> 00:59:03,50
Young SOMEONE<Orlov> halts on his way out and she kisses his ring. 

SALT_DVS330
00:59:03,00 --> 00:59:13,50
He hurries off down a long corridor. As the young girl stares longingly after him, a smooth featured man strides up. 

SALT_DVS331
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:29,50
Back in the present, SOMEONE<Salt> stares off over the water. Later, the passengers file off the ferry, past a TV showing a newscast. 

SALT_DVS332
00:59:43,00 --> 00:59:48,50
In a junkyard. 

SALT_DVS333
00:59:53,00 --> 00:59:57,50
SOMEONE<Orlov> and others watch TV. 

SALT_DVS338
01:00:23,00 --> 01:00:29,50
Give her a warm embrace. SOMEONE<Salt> strokes SOMEONE's<Orlov's> cheek. 

SALT_DVS339
01:00:30,00 --> 01:00:38,50
She kisses his ring. Cradling his hand and both of hers, she takes a stroll with him across the salvage yard. 

SALT_DVS341
01:00:56,00 --> 01:01:01,50
They hug again. 

SALT_DVS344
01:01:23,00 --> 01:01:33,50
Is around a floating barrel and angles toward a boxy barge. A henchman wielding a rifle stands guard on its deck. SOMEONE<Salt> studies him coolly. 

SALT_DVS346
01:01:46,00 --> 01:01:57,50
SOMEONE<Salt> beams. As SOMEONE<Orlov> leads her across a catwalk, her smile falters. She surveys some men working at a table beneath them. 

SALT_DVS348
01:02:09,00 --> 01:02:13,50
He gestures her forward. 

SALT_DVS349
01:02:12,00 --> 01:02:20,50
With a warm smile, SOMEONE<Salt> proceeds down a set of stairs. Her Russian mentor follows close behind. 

SALT_DVS350
01:02:20,00 --> 01:02:28,50
Reaching a dimly lit corridor, SOMEONE<Salt> turns to find two thugs lifting a large circular hatch on the floor. 

SALT_DVS351
01:02:29,00 --> 01:02:46,50
Her cool smile gone she ventures further in. SOMEONE<Orlov> trails his former protégée, observing her closely. The thugs step aside from the raised hatch. As SOMEONE<Salt> peers down through the opening, a flashlight turns on to reveal SOMEONE<Mike> bound with a chain. 

SALT_DVS352
01:02:43,00 --> 01:02:58,50
A crimson rag gags his mouth. As SOMEONE<Salt> stares at her husband, SOMEONE<Orlov> steps up beside her, scrutinizing her response. SOMEONE<Mike> gazes up at her. His gray eyes wide. SOMEONE<Salt> maintains her stony expression. 

SALT_DVS353
01:03:00,00 --> 01:03:11,50
SOMEONE<Mike> mashes his teeth around his gag as he stares pleadingly at his wife. She faces SOMEONE<Orlov> and her bee-stung lips curl into a cold smile. 

SALT_DVS354
01:03:09,00 --> 01:03:14,50
A thug aims his rifle at her. 

SALT_DVS355
01:03:13,00 --> 01:03:19,50
As SOMEONE<Orlov> turns away, her smile fades. 

SALT_DVS356
01:03:17,00 --> 01:03:22,50
And then turns, a guard wrenches a valve. 

SALT_DVS358
01:03:55,00 --> 01:04:03,50
Watching her husband's head thrash, SOMEONE<Salt> struggles to fight back tears welling in her eyes. 

SALT_DVS359
01:04:01,00 --> 01:04:10,50
She looks up at a guard in a suit, aiming a handgun at her. Blinking, she clears her eyes and faces SOMEONE<Orlov> without a hint of grief. 

SALT_DVS362
01:04:38,00 --> 01:04:43,50
They drink their vodka. 

SALT_DVS363
01:04:42,00 --> 01:04:48,50
To our family, sister. The man beside him nods to her. 

SALT_DVS364
01:04:47,00 --> 01:04:58,50
In a flashback, SOMEONE<Salt> glimpses young boys dressed in identical stripe shirts. Back in the present, SOMEONE<Orlov> escorts her into a radio room. 

SALT_DVS365
01:05:02,00 --> 01:05:05,50
Some more vodka. 

SALT_DVS366
01:05:07,00 --> 01:05:11,50
He marks a map. 

SALT_DVS369
01:05:46,00 --> 01:05:54,50
Rams over and over. SOMEONE's<Orlov's> head slips forward and the bloody bottle drops to the floor. SOMEONE's<Salt's> gaze darts. 

SALT_DVS370
01:05:52,00 --> 01:06:01,50
She strides across the room and opens several cases of weapons. Then slaps a click into the butt of a handgun. 

SALT_DVS374
01:06:45,00 --> 01:06:54,50
Falls dead beside his wounded comrade in a suit. As the terrified survivor struggles to crawl away, SOMEONE<Salt> moves over him. 

SALT_DVS375
01:06:57,00 --> 01:07:12,50
With gun, the man convulses then falls limp. SOMEONE<Salt> turns away with a stony expression. Holding her gun at a ready, she steps to the edge of the stairwell. She checks a corridor for survivors then drops her gaze downstairs. 

SALT_DVS376
01:07:11,00 --> 01:07:19,50
A dozen charred victims killed in the grenade blast lie in heaps around the open hatch. 

SALT_DVS377
01:07:17,00 --> 01:07:26,50
SOMEONE's<Salt's> gaze softens. She stares at the dark shimmering water flooding the chamber below. 

SALT_DVS378
01:07:24,00 --> 01:07:36,50
Her glistening eyes stare wistfully. In a flashback, SOMEONE<Salt> wears a bridal veil. She giggles and buries her face against the shoulder of SOMEONE's<Mike's> neatly pressed suit. 

SALT_DVS381
01:08:06,00 --> 01:08:11,50
Man in dress uniform steps up to SOMEONE<Salt>. 

SALT_DVS382
01:08:10,00 --> 01:08:14,50
She stares at him blankly. 

SALT_DVS383
01:08:13,00 --> 01:08:20,50
She recalls the young boy with the scar on his cheek lying in the bed next to hers. 

SALT_DVS384
01:08:19,00 --> 01:08:25,50
The man shows his scarred cheek. 

SALT_DVS385
01:08:27,00 --> 01:08:32,50
In a seat facing her. 

SALT_DVS389
01:08:48,00 --> 01:08:53,50
He hands her a badge. 

SALT_DVS390
01:08:55,00 --> 01:09:00,50
He shows a blueprint. 

SALT_DVS397
01:09:34,00 --> 01:09:40,50
SOMEONE<Salt> holds her palms together as he cups her hands in his. 

SALT_DVS398
01:09:39,00 --> 01:09:56,50
She locks eyes with him impassively. Nighttime. An aerial view shows the lights of Washington D. C. glowing around the dome of the capital building. Now SOMEONE<Shnaider> drives an SUV up to a checkpoint, a guard hurries over. 

SALT_DVS400
01:10:01,00 --> 01:10:08,50
One show SOMEONE<Shnaider> with his alias, the other a young man named SOMEONE<Major>. 

SALT_DVS402
01:10:30,00 --> 01:10:35,50
SOMEONE<Shnaider> turns and lifts his arms. 

SALT_DVS403
01:10:37,00 --> 01:10:44,50
The security agent runs a detection wand over him then lets him through. 

SALT_DVS404
01:10:43,00 --> 01:10:49,50
SOMEONE<Shnaider> watches her wave the wand over his colleague. 

SALT_DVS405
01:10:49,00 --> 01:11:02,50
SOMEONE<Valchek> turns revealing his soft features and bee-stung lips. The impostor grabs her service cap and attaché case from a security conveyor belt then walks beside SOMEONE<Shnaider>. 

SALT_DVS407
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:25,50
With the president. 

SALT_DVS408
01:11:42,00 --> 01:11:48,50
The group boards an elevator. Back with the others. 

SALT_DVS409
01:11:47,00 --> 01:11:53,50
As the adviser heads to the elevator, SOMEONE<Shnaider> eyes SOMEONE<Salt>. 

SALT_DVS410
01:12:02,00 --> 01:12:06,50
Later, SOMEONE<Shnaider> throw SOMEONE<Salt> to the floor. 

SALT_DVS411
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:24,50
The closing elevator doors, SOMEONE<Winter> spies SOMEONE<Salt> in her disguise. SOMEONE<Shnaider> presses a remote then explodes. 

SALT_DVS412
01:12:23,00 --> 01:12:27,50
In the hall. In the elevator. 

SALT_DVS413
01:12:31,00 --> 01:12:38,50
In a smoke-filled hallway, SOMEONE<Salt> rolls over and pushes herself onto her knees. 

SALT_DVS414
01:12:36,00 --> 01:12:43,50
She grabs a set of keys and a gun off a fallen agent then hurries upstairs. 

SALT_DVS415
01:12:45,00 --> 01:12:50,50
Adding herself in a room, she tears off her jacket. 

SALT_DVS416
01:12:48,00 --> 01:12:52,50
SOMEONE<Winter> shifts his eyes thoughtfully. 

SALT_DVS417
01:12:54,00 --> 01:12:59,50
SOMEONE<Salt> removes her false ears. 

SALT_DVS419
01:13:04,00 --> 01:13:09,50
She rips it away from her nose and mouth. Back in the elevator. 

SALT_DVS420
01:13:12,00 --> 01:13:16,50
The group hurries down a hall. 

SALT_DVS421
01:13:20,00 --> 01:13:26,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Salt> sneaks downstairs. 

SALT_DVS422
01:13:33,00 --> 01:13:38,50
The agent uses his radio. 

SALT_DVS423
01:13:44,00 --> 01:13:53,50
Meanwhile hiding against the wall by the stairs, SOMEONE<Salt> peers around the corner and sees a tactical team shuffling pass. Back with the president. 

SALT_DVS424
01:13:53,00 --> 01:13:59,50
Agents hurry the president down a hall. SOMEONE<Salt> sprints along at another. 

SALT_DVS425
01:13:57,00 --> 01:14:03,50
Turning a corner, the president and his men approach an elevator. 

SALT_DVS426
01:14:01,00 --> 01:14:06,50
They rush inside. 

SALT_DVS427
01:14:05,00 --> 01:14:09,50
A guard station in the hall. 

SALT_DVS429
01:14:19,00 --> 01:14:31,50
She pries the doors open and peers down into the shaft of the descending car. Her gaze sweeps to the metal framework along the walls and she leaps onto a crossbar. 

SALT_DVS430
01:14:28,00 --> 01:14:37,50
Then jumps to a lower beam in the opposite corner. Continuing in this manner, she gradually descends floor by floor. 

SALT_DVS431
01:14:41,00 --> 01:14:46,50
SOMEONE<Winter> glances toward the ceiling. 

SALT_DVS432
01:14:51,00 --> 01:14:55,50
An agent checks the entryway. 

SALT_DVS433
01:14:55,00 --> 01:15:03,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Salt> tightrope-walks along the beam in the elevator shaft. At the bunker door. 

SALT_DVS434
01:15:01,00 --> 01:15:12,50
In the shaft, SOMEONE<Salt> sees two parallel rails running down a wall. Squeezing between them, she slides down like an elevator on its tracks. In the bunker corridor. 

SALT_DVS435
01:15:15,00 --> 01:15:23,50
SOMEONE<Salt> reaches the bottom of the shaft. Now the heavily reinforced bunker door swings open. 

SALT_DVS436
01:15:21,00 --> 01:15:26,50
He addresses a bunker guard. 

SALT_DVS437
01:15:24,00 --> 01:15:31,50
As the president and his entourage walk through the doorway, the guard enters a code on a keypad. 

SALT_DVS440
01:15:41,00 --> 01:15:49,50
Using the stolen ID card, she unlocks the gate. Meanwhile. 

SALT_DVS441
01:15:46,00 --> 01:15:57,50
The president and his men head to the emergency operation center. With them, a military aide carries a briefcase, its handle tethered to his wrist. 

SALT_DVS442
01:16:15,00 --> 01:16:20,50
Satellite images appear. 

SALT_DVS444
01:16:53,00 --> 01:16:59,50
The military aide sets his briefcase on the table. 

SALT_DVS445
01:16:57,00 --> 01:17:03,50
And opens it and presses his thumb on a fingerprint scanner inside. 

SALT_DVS447
01:17:10,00 --> 01:17:15,50
Back in the emergency operation center. 

SALT_DVS448
01:17:15,00 --> 01:17:21,50
Secret service agent James joins a woman wearing a headset. 

SALT_DVS450
01:17:40,00 --> 01:17:44,50
Enters a code on the control pad. 

SALT_DVS451
01:17:50,00 --> 01:18:00,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Salt> hurries down a corridor. As two agents draw closer, she charges. She barrels one over then punches the other. 

SALT_DVS452
01:17:58,00 --> 01:18:02,50
The first agent slams her.  

SALT_DVS453
01:18:06,00 --> 01:18:12,50
The first agent and he falls. As he reaches for his gun 

SALT_DVS455
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:27,50
He knocks down the other agent as well. In the operation center, the scanner verifies the President's palm print. The Secretary of Defense holds a phone receiver in each hand. At the Pentagon, military officials watch a news report. 

SALT_DVS456
01:18:26,00 --> 01:18:31,50
A general picks up a red handled phone. Meanwhile, the Secretary 

SALT_DVS457
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:35,50
Of Defense hands one receiver to the president and the other to military aide. 

SALT_DVS458
01:18:38,00 --> 01:18:44,50
He sits and types on his computer  

SALT_DVS459
01:18:52,00 --> 01:18:56,50
Code matches the general's. 

SALT_DVS461
01:19:02,00 --> 01:19:07,50
The general hangs up.  

SALT_DVS462
01:19:09,00 --> 01:19:17,50
In the bunker with a two dead agents. Now Jenks turns to the lead bunker officer. 

SALT_DVS464
01:19:23,00 --> 01:19:29,50
Through a doorway, they see Officer Dryers body fall to the ground. 

SALT_DVS465
01:19:28,00 --> 01:19:33,50
SOMEONE<Salt> steps away from it. 

SALT_DVS466
01:19:53,00 --> 01:20:03,50
The President gapes. Outside the operation center, SOMEONE<Salt> shifts her eyes. Back inside, SOMEONE<Winter> aims his gun at the President. 

SALT_DVS467
01:20:01,00 --> 01:20:07,50
He lowers himself into a chair. His eyes wide. 

SALT_DVS468
01:20:18,00 --> 01:20:24,50
Over the table and SOMEONE<Winter> shoots her. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Salt> approaches the room. 

SALT_DVS469
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:43,50
SOMEONE<Winter> shoots him. Peering through a window, SOMEONE<Salt> sees the commander-in-chief fall out of his chair. As SOMEONE<Winter> removes his jacket, SOMEONE's<Salt's> gaze scans the room and takes in the dead body sprawled behind a control counter. 

SALT_DVS470
01:20:41,00 --> 01:20:47,50
SOMEONE<Winter> settles into a seat at the nuclear warfare computer. 

SALT_DVS471
01:20:45,00 --> 01:20:54,50
SOMEONE<Salt> presses a button on the wall intercom. Her eyes focused on her old colleague as he types. 

SALT_DVS472
01:20:59,00 --> 01:21:03,50
He looks over. 

SALT_DVS473
01:21:09,00 --> 01:21:15,50
SOMEONE<Salt> smiles at him. He lifts his brow. 

SALT_DVS474
01:21:31,00 --> 01:21:35,50
On the computer. 

SALT_DVS477
01:22:02,00 --> 01:22:11,50
Who uses a blowtorch on the reinforced door. Now a status bar shows the authorization reaching 29%. 

SALT_DVS478
01:22:19,00 --> 01:22:25,50
SOMEONE<Winter> approaches the window separating him from SOMEONE<Salt>. 

SALT_DVS481
01:22:52,00 --> 01:23:00,50
SOMEONE<Winter> stares into her pleading eyes. His jaws set tightly. Her breath fogs the glass. 

SALT_DVS482
01:23:03,00 --> 01:23:17,50
A tiny smile touches SOMEONE's<Winter's> lips and he nods. As he turns from the window, he spots a news report on the monitor. A caption underneath footage of Matveyev reads, Russian President alive. 

SALT_DVS484
01:23:40,00 --> 01:23:48,50
SOMEONE<Winter> turns back to the window and steps closer. On the other side, SOMEONE<Salt> stares unapologetically. 

SALT_DVS485
01:23:48,00 --> 01:23:54,50
He leans his arms against the glass and looks into her eyes. 

SALT_DVS486
01:24:06,00 --> 01:24:11,50
SOMEONE<Salt> defiantly lifts her chin. 

SALT_DVS487
01:24:14,00 --> 01:24:19,50
SOMEONE's<Winter's> lips spread into a smile. 

SALT_DVS488
01:24:58,00 --> 01:25:03,50
SOMEONE<Salt> fires a handgun at the bulletproof window. 

SALT_DVS489
01:25:03,00 --> 01:25:16,50
Her bullets create a cluster of snowflake-like impressions in the glass. She drops her emptied handgun and raises an automatic rifle. As her shots fail to shutter the window, SOMEONE<Winter> strolls back to the nuclear

SALT_DVS490
01:25:13,00 --> 01:25:18,50
Warfare computer. 

SALT_DVS491
01:25:16,00 --> 01:25:20,50
And smashes the butt of her rifle. 

SALT_DVS492
01:25:19,00 --> 01:25:25,50
In glass then notices a control pad by the door in the operation center. 

SALT_DVS493
01:25:25,00 --> 01:25:29,50
She heads down a hall. SOMEONE<Winter> glances

SALT_DVS495
01:25:51,00 --> 01:25:55,50
Into the biometric scanner. 

SALT_DVS496
01:25:53,00 --> 01:25:58,50
His hand down on the scanning pad. 

SALT_DVS501
01:26:25,00 --> 01:26:38,50
SOMEONE<Salt> breaks part of the wall away to reveal an electronic device inside. She removes some wires from it. In the operation center, SOMEONE<Winter> waits against the wall beside the door with his pistol in hand. 

SALT_DVS503
01:27:05,00 --> 01:27:09,50
In the operation center. 

SALT_DVS505
01:27:12,00 --> 01:27:16,50
She sinks to the floor. 

SALT_DVS506
01:27:17,00 --> 01:27:23,50
SOMEONE<Winter> marches to the controls. Scrambling to her feet. 

SALT_DVS508
01:27:26,00 --> 01:27:31,50
A round kick, rushes to the launch controls and types. 

SALT_DVS510
01:27:37,00 --> 01:27:41,50
Slams her down on the table. 

SALT_DVS512
01:27:50,00 --> 01:27:55,50
SOMEONE lunges to the launch controls  

SALT_DVS513
01:27:53,00 --> 01:27:57,50
Tap a link cord. She get shot 

SALT_DVS514
01:28:05,00 --> 01:28:11,50
SOMEONE<Salt> lies face down watching tensely. 

SALT_DVS515
01:28:12,00 --> 01:28:25,50
SOMEONE<Winter> keeps his weary gaze fixed on SOMEONE<Salt>. Taking her into custody, an officer yanks down her shirt and finds a bulletproof vest. Later, SOMEONE<Peabody> passes SOMEONE<Winter> and his men in a corridor. 

SALT_DVS516
01:28:41,00 --> 01:28:47,50
As SOMEONE<Salt> gets led past, she jerks her chin up at SOMEONE<Peabody>. 

SALT_DVS517
01:28:45,00 --> 01:28:51,50
He stares after her. Down the hall. 

SALT_DVS518
01:28:50,00 --> 01:28:58,50
Now the agents escort SOMEONE<Salt> of a curving flight of stairs to a landing, where SOMEONE<Winter> lingers with the SOMEONE<medic>. 

SALT_DVS519
01:29:08,00 --> 01:29:15,50
He slips a pair of scissors from the SOMEONE's<medic's> bag then locks eyes with SOMEONE<Salt>. 

SALT_DVS523
01:29:36,00 --> 01:29:40,50
Secret service agents haul SOMEONE<Salt> back up. 

SALT_DVS524
01:29:47,00 --> 01:29:52,50
The agents back SOMEONE<Salt> against the wall. 

SALT_DVS527
01:30:13,00 --> 01:30:19,50
They shove her in and then one wraps a blanket around her shoulders. 

SALT_DVS528
01:30:17,00 --> 01:30:22,50
She finds SOMEONE<Peabody> seated across from her. 

SALT_DVS531
01:30:39,00 --> 01:30:44,50
Away from the rising helicopter, followed by another chopper 

SALT_DVS532
01:30:49,00 --> 01:31:09,50
SOMEONE<Salt> gazes listlessly out the window. Her nose, cheek, and mouth stained with dark blood clots. She sees the Washington Monument pass by. A red light blinking at its apex. SOMEONE<Peabody> studies her with a thoughtful gaze. The helicopters rise high above the city, silhouetted against a rose and indigo sky. 

SALT_DVS534
01:31:25,00 --> 01:31:29,50
The agents look away uneasily. 

SALT_DVS535
01:31:29,00 --> 01:31:42,50
The bald man avoids his hostile glare. SOMEONE<Salt> eyes SOMEONE<Peabody> wearily. Her narrowed eyes glistening. He shifts angrily in his seat. SOMEONE<Salt> coldly straightens and looks him in the eye. 

SALT_DVS538
01:32:22,00 --> 01:32:29,50
His chest heaving, SOMEONE<Peabody> shifts his bewildered gaze then looks to SOMEONE<Salt> again. 

SALT_DVS539
01:32:46,00 --> 01:32:53,50
SOMEONE<Peabody> looks away. His lips tightly pursed. 

SALT_DVS541
01:33:11,00 --> 01:33:28,50
He takes out his cell and eyes the display. It reads, Urgent message - fingerprints place SOMEONE<Salt> on barge where SOMEONE<Orlov> was killed. SOMEONE<Peabody> looks up at the mysterious woman, who watches him with a steady earnest gaze. His brow creased. He puts the cellphone back in his pocket. 

SALT_DVS544
01:33:42,00 --> 01:33:54,50
SOMEONE<Peabody> lowers his gaze to the handcuff around SOMEONE's<Salt's> wrist restraints. As he looks up at her blood stained face, her eyes glisten and she displays a big smile. 

SALT_DVS545
01:33:59,00 --> 01:34:05,50
SOMEONE<Peabody> studies her resolute expression. 

SALT_DVS546
01:34:05,00 --> 01:34:23,50
Craning his neck, he looks pass her to the FBI agents. He glances down again at SOMEONE's<Salt's> restraints then eyes the bald man. He talks on a headset. A window shows their approach over the Potomac River. SOMEONE<Peabody> gives SOMEONE<Salt> a meaningful look which she registers coldly. 

SALT_DVS548
01:34:32,00 --> 01:34:38,50
SOMEONE<Salt> stares at him and he directs her gaze toward the window. 

SALT_DVS549
01:34:40,00 --> 01:34:48,50
Seeing a river below, she discreetly unbuckles her seat belt. SOMEONE<Peabody> watches her gravely. 

SALT_DVS550
01:34:47,00 --> 01:35:09,50
His lips screwed tightly. He glances out of the Potomac then directs her gaze to the door. It bears a semi-circular emergency release handle. Swallowing, SOMEONE<Salt> watches SOMEONE's<Peabody's> finger tap deliberately against his leg. She steals herself with a deep breath. As SOMEONE's<Peabody's> hand closes into a fist, she lunges for the emergency release. 

SALT_DVS552
01:35:20,00 --> 01:35:28,50
His brow furrowed. He stares into the water. It shows no sign of the mysterious woman. 

SALT_DVS553
01:35:34,00 --> 01:35:42,50
Searching fruitlessly for SOMEONE<Salt>, SOMEONE<Peabody> allows a smile and gives a satisfied nod. 

SALT_DVS555
01:35:47,00 --> 01:35:52,50
They turn away from the Potomac's rocky bank. 

SALT_DVS556
01:35:52,00 --> 01:36:15,50
The river's edge, hands caress at a snow blanket of rock as slim figure wades through the knee-deep water. SOMEONE<Salt> rushes a shore and dashes through the woods, pumping her shackled arms. Leaning briefly against a tree trunk, she glances over her shoulder. She breathes hard through her parted lips. Her wet short hair clinging to her head. Her feet carry her over the forest snowy ground. 

SALT_DVS557
01:36:13,00 --> 01:36:21,50
She watches SOMEONE's<Peabody's> helicopter leaves the Potomac and its bordering wetlands. She ventures onward.
