SANCTUM_DVS14
00:03:37,00 --> 00:03:41,50
In the cockpit. 

SANCTUM_DVS15
00:04:41,00 --> 00:04:45,50
Covered valley. 

SANCTUM_DVS16
00:04:55,00 --> 00:04:59,50
Humongous hole in the Earth. 

SANCTUM_DVS19
00:05:13,00 --> 00:05:18,50
Inside the cave, a fair-haired man floats in shallow water. 

SANCTUM_DVS20
00:05:16,00 --> 00:05:23,50
Wearing only a wet suit, he goes through the motions of checking his equipment. 

SANCTUM_DVS21
00:05:22,00 --> 00:05:27,50
He shakes his head, then lifts it out of the water. 

SANCTUM_DVS22
00:05:26,00 --> 00:05:40,50
The fair-haired man gently swims across the rocky pool and climbs onto a ledge. A lanky man wearing a climber's helmet sits nearby. He gets up and moves a large backpack. 

SANCTUM_DVS23
00:05:48,00 --> 00:05:54,50
SOMEONE<JD> hands a camera to a goateed guy wearing a Ramones t-shirt. 

SANCTUM_DVS24
00:06:09,00 --> 00:06:16,50
The goateed guy leaves a canopy-covered station and steps past the two divers. 

SANCTUM_DVS25
00:06:16,00 --> 00:06:23,50
At the foot of another pool, he sets a shoebox-sized camera into the water. 

SANCTUM_DVS26
00:06:25,00 --> 00:06:34,50
He leaves the pool and sits behind a computer housed inside an orange plastic case. 

SANCTUM_DVS27
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:39,50
Nearby, SOMEONE<JD> helps the female diver strap a rebreather to her back. 

SANCTUM_DVS28
00:06:39,00 --> 00:06:44,50
She gets a reading on a handheld device. 

SANCTUM_DVS29
00:06:55,00 --> 00:07:02,50
SOMEONE<George> gets up from his station and faces her with his hands on his hips. 

SANCTUM_DVS30
00:07:03,00 --> 00:07:08,50
She nods. 

SANCTUM_DVS31
00:07:06,00 --> 00:07:11,50
SOMEONE<Frank> joins them. 

SANCTUM_DVS32
00:07:35,00 --> 00:07:44,50
They help the brunette out. Now, the locals guide the group through ankle-high water. Men carry oxygen tanks in the opposite direction. 

SANCTUM_DVS33
00:07:43,00 --> 00:07:48,50
He hands a tank to a local. 

SANCTUM_DVS34
00:07:53,00 --> 00:07:59,50
The balding man takes off his hat and faces SOMEONE<Carl>. 

SANCTUM_DVS35
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:04,50
SOMEONE<Carl> shrugs. 

SANCTUM_DVS36
00:08:05,00 --> 00:08:10,50
He shakes his head and steps past. 

SANCTUM_DVS37
00:08:13,00 --> 00:08:17,50
He continues on. 

SANCTUM_DVS38
00:08:15,00 --> 00:08:20,50
SOMEONE<Jim> taps SOMEONE<Josh> with his hat. 

SANCTUM_DVS39
00:08:40,00 --> 00:08:47,50
Inside the cave, SOMEONE<George> joins SOMEONE<Frank> at another computer station. 

SANCTUM_DVS40
00:08:49,00 --> 00:08:54,50
He points to his schematic of the cave. 

SANCTUM_DVS41
00:09:05,00 --> 00:09:09,50
He calls up a map. 

SANCTUM_DVS43
00:09:18,00 --> 00:09:22,50
SOMEONE<Jim> approaches a native. 

SANCTUM_DVS44
00:09:21,00 --> 00:09:31,50
The brunette notices a penned-in wild boar, a local woman sitting on a path, and two young men wearing grass skirts. 

SANCTUM_DVS45
00:09:28,00 --> 00:09:33,50
SOMEONE<Carl> greets a camera crew. 

SANCTUM_DVS48
00:10:13,00 --> 00:10:19,50
In a tent office, they view a computer animation of the complex cave system. 

SANCTUM_DVS50
00:11:05,00 --> 00:11:11,50
At forward base, the female diver prepares. 

SANCTUM_DVS51
00:11:12,00 --> 00:11:19,50
SOMEONE<Frank> eyes SOMEONE<George> over his shoulder. Lowering his gaze, he turns to face him. 

SANCTUM_DVS52
00:11:25,00 --> 00:11:32,50
SOMEONE<Frank> leaves the computer station to approach SOMEONE<Judes> and SOMEONE<JD>. 

SANCTUM_DVS53
00:11:31,00 --> 00:11:37,50
They all look to SOMEONE<George> who checks the computer. 

SANCTUM_DVS54
00:11:45,00 --> 00:11:49,50
SOMEONE<Frank> returns to the computer. 

SANCTUM_DVS55
00:12:23,00 --> 00:12:27,50
He shows a liquor bottle. 

SANCTUM_DVS56
00:12:37,00 --> 00:12:43,50
As the others at forward base laugh, SOMEONE<Frank> gives a smirk. 

SANCTUM_DVS57
00:12:47,00 --> 00:12:51,50
SOMEONE<George> eyes SOMEONE<Frank>. 

SANCTUM_DVS58
00:12:56,00 --> 00:13:02,50
He views his disgruntled son onscreen. 

SANCTUM_DVS59
00:13:18,00 --> 00:13:26,50
SOMEONE<Josh> shuts off the feed. SOMEONE<Frank> sits back. Later, he prepares for the dive. 

SANCTUM_DVS60
00:13:36,00 --> 00:13:40,50
He sets his rebreather backpack. 

SANCTUM_DVS61
00:13:39,00 --> 00:13:44,50
SOMEONE<Judes> eyes him. 

SANCTUM_DVS62
00:14:07,00 --> 00:14:12,50
She holds his hands. 

SANCTUM_DVS64
00:14:26,00 --> 00:14:31,50
He helps fasten her harness. 

SANCTUM_DVS65
00:14:46,00 --> 00:14:52,50
SOMEONE<Victoria> chucks a cellphone into the cave. 

SANCTUM_DVS66
00:14:50,00 --> 00:14:55,50
SOMEONE<Carl> shakes his head. 

SANCTUM_DVS67
00:15:04,00 --> 00:15:11,50
She shares a smile with SOMEONE<Carl>, then looks to SOMEONE<Josh> and jumps backward over the edge. 

SANCTUM_DVS68
00:15:12,00 --> 00:15:19,50
As SOMEONE<Victoria> rappels down the vertical wall, SOMEONE<Josh> watches her from above. 

SANCTUM_DVS69
00:15:17,00 --> 00:15:22,50
He looks back at SOMEONE<Carl>. 

SANCTUM_DVS70
00:15:39,00 --> 00:15:44,50
He steps off of the edge and falls face down. 

SANCTUM_DVS72
00:15:50,00 --> 00:15:55,50
About halfway down, SOMEONE<Josh> catches up with SOMEONE<Victoria>. 

SANCTUM_DVS73
00:16:01,00 --> 00:16:06,50
Surface, SOMEONE<Jim> brings SOMEONE<Carl> another cellphone. 

SANCTUM_DVS74
00:16:08,00 --> 00:16:15,50
He dives over the edge with open arms and falls into the dark abyss. 

SANCTUM_DVS75
00:16:14,00 --> 00:16:18,50
He lowers the phone. 

SANCTUM_DVS77
00:16:30,00 --> 00:16:34,50
It shines in through the distant aperture. 

SANCTUM_DVS78
00:16:43,00 --> 00:16:48,50
Returns to his work. SOMEONE<Josh> and SOMEONE<Victoria> look on. 

SANCTUM_DVS79
00:16:48,00 --> 00:16:56,50
They each continue their descent. At forward base, SOMEONE<George> faces SOMEONE<Judes>. 

SANCTUM_DVS82
00:17:11,00 --> 00:17:17,50
SOMEONE<George> releases Virgil into the pool and the robot sets off after the diver. 

SANCTUM_DVS83
00:17:18,00 --> 00:17:22,50
He watches them go underwater.  

SANCTUM_DVS84
00:17:23,00 --> 00:17:32,50
a pale flashlight shines over the darkened rocks as a diver emerges from a narrow passage. 

SANCTUM_DVS85
00:17:32,00 --> 00:17:41,50
Flap of his swim fins propels the lead diver through the water. SOMEONE<Judes> follow, shining her flashlight over the rock walls. 

SANCTUM_DVS86
00:17:39,00 --> 00:17:47,50
A single spotlight shines up from the floor as SOMEONE<Frank> leads them through the darkened chamber. 

SANCTUM_DVS89
00:18:41,00 --> 00:18:48,50
At the other base camp, SOMEONE<Carl> dunks a teabag into a mug. 

SANCTUM_DVS90
00:18:46,00 --> 00:18:53,50
Seated on a rock, he waits for SOMEONE<Josh> and SOMEONE<Victoria> to reach the bottom. 

SANCTUM_DVS91
00:18:58,00 --> 00:19:02,50
Finger and he grins. 

SANCTUM_DVS92
00:19:02,00 --> 00:19:08,50
Water, SOMEONE<Judes> detaches an air cylinder from the decompression chamber. 

SANCTUM_DVS95
00:19:30,00 --> 00:19:35,50
SOMEONE<Frank> looks back at SOMEONE<Judes>. 

SANCTUM_DVS96
00:19:36,00 --> 00:19:41,50
Mask. His shadow appears on the rock wall. 

SANCTUM_DVS98
00:19:52,00 --> 00:19:58,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Victoria> and SOMEONE<Carl> rappel down a craggy shaft. 

SANCTUM_DVS99
00:20:02,00 --> 00:20:08,50
Sitting back in her harness, her feet pressed against the rock wall. 

SANCTUM_DVS102
00:20:37,00 --> 00:20:45,50
SOMEONE<Josh> descends another shaft. At forward base, SOMEONE<JD> hands SOMEONE<Liz> a mug while SOMEONE<George>

SANCTUM_DVS103
00:20:43,00 --> 00:20:47,50
watches the divers on the monitor. 

SANCTUM_DVS105
00:21:20,00 --> 00:21:28,50
She eyes a tunnel blocked by a cluster of rocks. As SOMEONE<Frank> clears the entrance, Virgil lines up behind them. 

SANCTUM_DVS106
00:21:32,00 --> 00:21:37,50
Last rock and gazes into a dark passageway. 

SANCTUM_DVS107
00:21:39,00 --> 00:21:51,50
SOMEONE<George>, SOMEONE<Liz>, and SOMEONE<JD> watch the monitor. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Luko> climbs out of shallow water onto a rock ledge where SOMEONE<Carl> stands filming a cavern with a video camera. 

SANCTUM_DVS109
00:21:58,00 --> 00:22:02,50
She sits on the ledge above. 

SANCTUM_DVS110
00:22:17,00 --> 00:22:20,50
The tusk on a necklace. 

SANCTUM_DVS113
00:23:33,00 --> 00:23:39,50
SOMEONE<Frank> unclips his extra oxygen tank and pushes it away. 

SANCTUM_DVS116
00:24:10,00 --> 00:24:16,50
He struggles through the narrow tunnel. 

SANCTUM_DVS117
00:24:13,00 --> 00:24:18,50
He follows close behind her, rebreather also removed from her back. 

SANCTUM_DVS118
00:24:17,00 --> 00:24:20,50
He works a joystick. 

SANCTUM_DVS120
00:24:24,00 --> 00:24:29,50
He flippers as she struggles forward. 

SANCTUM_DVS121
00:24:39,00 --> 00:24:45,50
As she pushes her rebreather, its pack snags on a rock. 

SANCTUM_DVS123
00:25:10,00 --> 00:25:16,50
SOMEONE<Frank> continues on and SOMEONE<Judes> follows. 

SANCTUM_DVS124
00:25:13,00 --> 00:25:24,50
Now in an area enveloped by darkness, a beam of light shines out, its radius growing larger as SOMEONE<Frank> emerges from the tunnel into a cavern. 

SANCTUM_DVS126
00:25:28,00 --> 00:25:36,50
A wall below the tunnel. As SOMEONE<Judes> emerges behind him, SOMEONE<Frank> anchors a guide line to the cavern wall. 

SANCTUM_DVS130
00:26:24,00 --> 00:26:28,50
SOMEONE<Frank> shines a flashlight. 

SANCTUM_DVS131
00:26:57,00 --> 00:27:02,50
Pointing his finger, he swirls it in a circle. 

SANCTUM_DVS132
00:27:07,00 --> 00:27:11,50
SOMEONE<Judes> heads back to the tunnel. 

SANCTUM_DVS133
00:28:42,00 --> 00:28:46,50
As she sucks in a mouthful of water. 

SANCTUM_DVS134
00:28:45,00 --> 00:28:49,50
And then her body jerks. 

SANCTUM_DVS136
00:28:56,00 --> 00:29:03,50
Virgil glides over to SOMEONE<Frank> who turns, peering out at SOMEONE<George> from the monitor. 

SANCTUM_DVS137
00:29:06,00 --> 00:29:15,50
He squeezes his eyes shut. SOMEONE<Liz> watches the monitor with a grave look and SOMEONE<JD> shifts his gaze away. 

SANCTUM_DVS138
00:29:13,00 --> 00:29:19,50
Now, SOMEONE' body floats against the decompression chamber outer wall. 

SANCTUM_DVS140
00:29:23,00 --> 00:29:28,50
His eyes fixed on his lifeless colleague. 

SANCTUM_DVS141
00:29:30,00 --> 00:29:38,50
Now at forward base, SOMEONE<George> lugs a rebreather pack ashore as SOMEONE<JD> and SOMEONE<Liz> come out of the water. 

SANCTUM_DVS142
00:29:36,00 --> 00:29:43,50
Sitting on the rock, the monitor replays SOMEONE's<Frank's> struggle with SOMEONE<Judes>. 

SANCTUM_DVS143
00:29:41,00 --> 00:29:48,50
SOMEONE<Josh> steps into view, his brow creased in anguish. 

SANCTUM_DVS144
00:30:41,00 --> 00:30:49,50
SOMEONE<Josh> sees his father standing at the water's edge, his arms cradling SOMEONE<Judes> limp body. 

SANCTUM_DVS145
00:30:47,00 --> 00:30:52,50
SOMEONE<Luko> and SOMEONE<Liz> lifted on to the rocks. 

SANCTUM_DVS146
00:30:52,00 --> 00:30:59,50
Above ground, wind bellows through trees and lightning flashes. 

SANCTUM_DVS147
00:31:08,00 --> 00:31:15,50
Back at forward base, SOMEONE<Frank> joins SOMEONE<Josh> under the tent. 

SANCTUM_DVS148
00:31:18,00 --> 00:31:23,50
SOMEONE<Frank> tries the radio. 

SANCTUM_DVS149
00:31:27,00 --> 00:31:35,50
SOMEONE<Victoria> shoots SOMEONE<Frank> a sidelong glance, then sits beside SOMEONE<Carl> who eats rice from a pot. 

SANCTUM_DVS150
00:31:38,00 --> 00:31:42,50
SOMEONE<Frank> turns off the radio. 

SANCTUM_DVS151
00:31:41,00 --> 00:31:49,50
He sits heavily beside his son, pulls the cork from his tequila bottle, and takes a swig. 

SANCTUM_DVS152
00:31:49,00 --> 00:31:56,50
With his head bowed, he holds the bottle out to SOMEONE<Josh> who takes it and drinks. 

SANCTUM_DVS153
00:31:57,00 --> 00:32:03,50
The young man swallows then lets out a deep breath. 

SANCTUM_DVS154
00:32:02,00 --> 00:32:08,50
SOMEONE<Frank> lifts his head but avoids his son's gaze. 

SANCTUM_DVS155
00:32:51,00 --> 00:32:58,50
SOMEONE<Josh> clenches his jaw and his nostrils flare. SOMEONE<Frank> stands. 

SANCTUM_DVS156
00:33:22,00 --> 00:33:27,50
SOMEONE<Luko> taps SOMEONE<Frank>. 

SANCTUM_DVS159
00:33:53,00 --> 00:34:01,50
Tribal shaman elder lifts his face to the dark sky. Rain pours down on him. 

SANCTUM_DVS160
00:33:59,00 --> 00:34:08,50
The aerial shows the deluge plummeting into the cave's pitch black mouth. 

SANCTUM_DVS162
00:34:10,00 --> 00:34:15,50
His feet splashing in muddy water. 

SANCTUM_DVS163
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:19,50
And SOMEONE<Josh> eyes the boar tooth torch around his neck. 

SANCTUM_DVS164
00:34:16,00 --> 00:34:21,50
He tries to yank it off then glares at it. 

SANCTUM_DVS165
00:34:19,00 --> 00:34:23,50
As he tugs again. 

SANCTUM_DVS166
00:34:23,00 --> 00:34:27,50
He tilts his head alertly. 

SANCTUM_DVS169
00:34:41,00 --> 00:34:45,50
SOMEONE<Josh> takes the lead. 

SANCTUM_DVS170
00:34:43,00 --> 00:35:00,50
At forward base, SOMEONE<Frank> sits in front of the monitor swigging from his bottle. Sweeping his gaze around the cave, he wipes his mouth the back of his hand then picks up a flashlight. He glides his beam up a wall to a crevasse in the rock. 

SANCTUM_DVS171
00:34:59,00 --> 00:35:12,50
SOMEONE<Carl> joins him. Sitting in front of the monitor, he eyes the onscreen footage of St. Jude's Cathedral where Virgil's light shines up a towering shaft toward the rippling surface of the air bell. 

SANCTUM_DVS172
00:35:12,00 --> 00:35:17,50
SOMEONE<Carl> drinks from the tequila bottle. 

SANCTUM_DVS173
00:35:23,00 --> 00:35:29,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Josh> stops at a comm station. 

SANCTUM_DVS178
00:37:25,00 --> 00:37:32,50
Leaks through cracks, raining into the cave. SOMEONE<Frank> gazes around. 

SANCTUM_DVS181
00:37:55,00 --> 00:38:02,50
SOMEONE<Liz> and SOMEONE<JD> look up the shaft with their headlamps. 

SANCTUM_DVS185
00:38:16,00 --> 00:38:21,50
His companions stare gravely. 

SANCTUM_DVS186
00:38:20,00 --> 00:38:28,50
SOMEONE<Carl> looks around. 

SANCTUM_DVS190
00:43:27,00 --> 00:43:32,50
SOMEONE<Josh> tearfully bares his teeth. 

SANCTUM_DVS191
00:43:43,00 --> 00:43:48,50
He looks his son in the eye and gives a small nod. 

SANCTUM_DVS192
00:43:47,00 --> 00:43:54,50
Looking up, SOMEONE<Carl> notices the boulder sealing off their exit. 

SANCTUM_DVS193
00:43:56,00 --> 00:44:03,50
On the upper edge blows out shooting sparks and leaving the falls in darkness. 

SANCTUM_DVS195
00:44:08,00 --> 00:44:20,50
SOMEONE<George> pants in an agonized SOMEONE<grimace>. Later, the team arrives back at the dark, flooded base camp. 

SANCTUM_DVS198
00:44:45,00 --> 00:44:49,50
SOMEONE<Victoria> packs. 

SANCTUM_DVS200
00:44:54,00 --> 00:45:05,50
SOMEONE<Frank> rushes to a floating body bag and gently pulls it open to reveal SOMEONE'<Judes'> lifeless face. 

SANCTUM_DVS202
00:45:05,00 --> 00:45:09,50
SOMEONE watches, He remove the dead woman's wetsuit. 

SANCTUM_DVS204
00:45:55,00 --> 00:46:03,50
She folds her arms across her chest and stubbornly plants her feet. 

SANCTUM_DVS205
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:07,50
SOMEONE<Frank> gravely looks from her to SOMEONE<George>. 

SANCTUM_DVS208
00:46:27,00 --> 00:46:36,50
Searching the area for supplies, SOMEONE<Josh> heads around a large flowstone feature and halts. Two motionless legs float before him. 

SANCTUM_DVS211
00:46:41,00 --> 00:46:49,50
Pulling him into the light, SOMEONE<Josh> finds SOMEONE's<Luko's> face pulverized beyond recognition. 

SANCTUM_DVS212
00:46:46,00 --> 00:46:50,50
The Eye opens. 

SANCTUM_DVS213
00:46:48,00 --> 00:46:52,50
SOMEONE<Frank> hurries over. 

SANCTUM_DVS214
00:46:51,00 --> 00:46:56,50
He crouches by his gravely injured colleague. 

SANCTUM_DVS215
00:47:02,00 --> 00:47:07,50
SOMEONE<Victoria> queasily turns away. 

SANCTUM_DVS216
00:47:38,00 --> 00:47:42,50
SOMEONE drags SOMEONE away. 

SANCTUM_DVS217
00:47:41,00 --> 00:47:45,50
SOMEONE drags SOMEONE back. 

SANCTUM_DVS219
00:47:57,00 --> 00:48:02,50
The injured man wraps an arm around his friend's shoulder. 

SANCTUM_DVS223
00:48:19,00 --> 00:48:27,50
Then pushes against his throat. Maintaining his hold, the older man bites his lip. 

SANCTUM_DVS224
00:48:26,00 --> 00:48:32,50
SOMEONE's<Luko's> hand grabs his shoulder again, flexes weakly, and goes limp. 

SANCTUM_DVS225
00:48:31,00 --> 00:48:47,50
Now underwater, we peer up at four pairs of legs silhouetted against the light above the surface. There feet clad in flippers, they lazily tread water. Back at the large flowstone feature, SOMEONE<Frank> crouches over his euthanized friend. 

SANCTUM_DVS226
00:48:45,00 --> 00:48:51,50
Now we float up toward the lazily kicking legs. 

SANCTUM_DVS228
00:48:53,00 --> 00:48:58,50
He lowers his goggles. 

SANCTUM_DVS233
00:50:28,00 --> 00:50:32,50
As their headlamps descend, the cave goes dark. 

SANCTUM_DVS235
00:50:34,00 --> 00:50:42,50
Now, SOMEONE<Frank> leads the way through the narrow passage leading to the Devil's Restriction. 

SANCTUM_DVS237
00:50:43,00 --> 00:51:01,50
SOMEONE<Josh> swims into view, pulling at the rocks beneath him. His father takes his hand, places it on the guide line, and gives the okay signal. SOMEONE<Josh> returns the gesture. His father swims on, leading him through the winding passage. 

SANCTUM_DVS238
00:51:02,00 --> 00:51:08,50
SOMEONE<Frank> passes the decompression chamber. 

SANCTUM_DVS239
00:51:08,00 --> 00:51:15,50
From a distance, we watch the team of divers recede into the murky depths. 

SANCTUM_DVS241
00:51:17,00 --> 00:51:22,50
A light on her rebreather pack glows green. 

SANCTUM_DVS243
00:51:24,00 --> 00:51:29,50
While SOMEONE<Josh> soberly looks on. SOMEONE<Josh> goes next, shoving his gear in before him. 

SANCTUM_DVS249
00:52:16,00 --> 00:52:24,50
The Restriction and swims in after it. Left alone, SOMEONE<Victoria> worriedly shakes her head and looks away. 

SANCTUM_DVS250
00:52:22,00 --> 00:52:27,50
SOMEONE's<George's> flippered feet paddle out of view. 

SANCTUM_DVS251
00:52:31,00 --> 00:52:36,50
Effort, she pushes her gear into the restriction. 

SANCTUM_DVS252
00:52:37,00 --> 00:52:44,50
Ahead, shimmering green light grows visible from around a bend. 

SANCTUM_DVS255
00:52:51,00 --> 00:53:02,50
Her eyes wide behind her goggles. Up ahead, SOMEONE<Josh> pushes himself through the exit. His father hovers in St. Jude's Cathedral waiting for him. 

SANCTUM_DVS257
00:53:19,00 --> 00:53:26,50
Ahead, SOMEONE<George> joins Franks, SOMEONE<Josh>, and SOMEONE<Carl> outside the tunnel exit. 

SANCTUM_DVS258
00:53:28,00 --> 00:53:36,50
With her fists. In the Cathedral, SOMEONE<George> faces SOMEONE<Frank> worriedly. 

SANCTUM_DVS260
00:53:42,00 --> 00:53:47,50
The others continue to wait in one line. 

SANCTUM_DVS261
00:53:53,00 --> 00:54:11,50
Grabs hold and jerks at it. Outside the tunnel, the exit shows no sign of her approach. SOMEONE<George> taps his boss on the shoulder. As SOMEONE<Frank> faces him, he points at his own eyes then at the restriction. SOMEONE<Frank> shakes his head, wags a finger, then swims toward the tunnel himself. 

SANCTUM_DVS263
00:54:14,00 --> 00:54:19,50
A headlamp beam appears from the darkness. 

SANCTUM_DVS264
00:54:18,00 --> 00:54:24,50
SOMEONE turns to look as SOMEONE crawls into view. 

SANCTUM_DVS265
00:54:23,00 --> 00:54:27,50
He swims forward. SOMEONE rubs her arm. 

SANCTUM_DVS268
00:54:48,00 --> 00:54:56,50
Then jerks his thumb upward. Now, a beam of light shines toward the rippling surface of the air bell above. 

SANCTUM_DVS269
00:55:00,00 --> 00:55:04,50
SOMEONE removes his mouthpiece.  

SANCTUM_DVS271
00:55:08,00 --> 00:55:17,50
On to the rocky bank, He pulls of an elastic band strapping a flashlight to his arm and turns on his helmet's secondary light. 

SANCTUM_DVS272
00:55:15,00 --> 00:55:24,50
Drips from his wetsuit as his lamp sweeps over the cavern. With an awestruck smile, he ventures forward. 

SANCTUM_DVS273
00:55:25,00 --> 00:55:31,50
The pool next and finds the financier wandering out of view. 

SANCTUM_DVS274
00:55:32,00 --> 00:55:39,50
The young man climbs up on an underwater ledge and raises his flippered feet. 

SANCTUM_DVS275
00:55:38,00 --> 00:55:45,50
Hiking over a ridge, SOMEONE<Carl> finds a vast cavernous passageway ascending before him. 

SANCTUM_DVS277
00:55:49,00 --> 00:55:55,50
Dwarfed to a minuscule size by his surroundings. 

SANCTUM_DVS280
00:56:28,00 --> 00:56:33,50
And SOMEONE<Josh> covers her with the metal tissue-thin space blanket. 

SANCTUM_DVS282
00:56:45,00 --> 00:57:00,50
He sits him down and hands him a rebreather. SOMEONE<George> puts it to his mouth. Stepping away, SOMEONE<Frank> reaches into his supply pack and pulls out a knife with a six inch blade. 

SANCTUM_DVS284
00:57:09,00 --> 00:57:18,50
SOMEONE<Josh> grimly switches off his helmet lamp, so does SOMEONE<Frank>. 

SANCTUM_DVS285
00:57:20,00 --> 00:57:25,50
Now, SOMEONE<Josh> wakes up from a nap. 

SANCTUM_DVS286
00:57:25,00 --> 00:57:32,50
SOMEONE<Carl> rubs SOMEONE's<Victoria's> foot as she sits under the metallic blanket. 

SANCTUM_DVS287
00:57:34,00 --> 00:57:43,50
A veiny red discoloration on his left pack. As SOMEONE<Frank> whispers to himself eyes closed, SOMEONE<Josh> sits by him. 

SANCTUM_DVS288
00:57:41,00 --> 00:57:48,50
SOMEONE<Frank> breaks off muttering and opens his eyes. SOMEONE<Victoria> shivers. 

SANCTUM_DVS289
00:57:51,00 --> 00:57:58,50
She flashes a meek smile. SOMEONE<Frank> confers with SOMEONE<Josh>. 

SANCTUM_DVS291
00:58:59,00 --> 00:59:05,50
The six inch knife in the ground is almost completely submerged. 

SANCTUM_DVS292
00:59:03,00 --> 00:59:13,50
Now, we drift over a rippling subterranean pond as the group crosses a cavern as big as a covered stadium. 

SANCTUM_DVS293
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:24,50
SOMEONE<Frank> steps out from behind a pitch black wall and shines his helmet light across a rocky passage. Water rains down lightly inside the sleek room-sized space. 

SANCTUM_DVS294
00:59:22,00 --> 00:59:28,50
SOMEONE<Frank> climbs over a rock barrier carrying a yellow supply bag. 

SANCTUM_DVS295
00:59:27,00 --> 00:59:32,50
Just footsteps behind, SOMEONE<Carl> follows. 

SANCTUM_DVS296
00:59:31,00 --> 00:59:37,50
SOMEONE<Victoria> comes next, then SOMEONE<Josh>. 

SANCTUM_DVS297
00:59:35,00 --> 00:59:46,50
Bringing up the rear, SOMEONE<George> stops and adjusts his helmet light. SOMEONE<Josh> looks back at his hesitant friend who makes a fist and presses on. 

SANCTUM_DVS298
00:59:45,00 --> 00:59:58,50
Rocky partition and peers down a fairly spacious passageway, his helmet light striking the rain-like mist. He then sidles to his right and trains his light beam down a smaller tunnel. 

SANCTUM_DVS302
01:00:34,00 --> 01:00:40,50
SOMEONE<George> marches on, saddled with gear. He stumbles. 

SANCTUM_DVS304
01:00:41,00 --> 01:00:46,50
SOMEONE<Josh> continues up an incline. 

SANCTUM_DVS307
01:01:56,00 --> 01:02:02,50
They share a grin and SOMEONE<George> leads them ahead. 

SANCTUM_DVS308
01:02:35,00 --> 01:02:41,50
SOMEONE's<Josh's> gaze grows mildly sullen and distant. 

SANCTUM_DVS309
01:02:48,00 --> 01:02:55,50
As SOMEONE<George> eyes him squarely, SOMEONE<Josh> deflects the order with a brotherly smirk. 

SANCTUM_DVS312
01:03:09,00 --> 01:03:16,50
He looks at more shimmering blood on his palm and makes a fist. 

SANCTUM_DVS313
01:03:15,00 --> 01:03:21,50
He closes his eyes and nods. 

SANCTUM_DVS314
01:03:22,00 --> 01:03:29,50
SOMEONE<Victoria> continues on wearing a bulky white rebreather on her back. 

SANCTUM_DVS316
01:03:35,00 --> 01:03:40,50
On a ledge above them, SOMEONE<Carl> hauls up his gear. 

SANCTUM_DVS317
01:03:41,00 --> 01:03:45,50
SOMEONE<Josh> arrives. 

SANCTUM_DVS318
01:03:56,00 --> 01:04:01,50
SOMEONE<Frank> and SOMEONE<Josh> go looking for him. 

SANCTUM_DVS319
01:04:08,00 --> 01:04:14,50
SOMEONE<Josh> leads the way into another rocky den. 

SANCTUM_DVS320
01:04:26,00 --> 01:04:32,50
A crude carving reads "George was here". 

SANCTUM_DVS321
01:04:36,00 --> 01:04:42,50
Blood trails from SOMEONE's<George's> mouth. 

SANCTUM_DVS322
01:04:40,00 --> 01:04:46,50
Light from his partner's helmet dwindles on the dying man. 

SANCTUM_DVS323
01:04:45,00 --> 01:04:52,50
The last of the light fades out, leaving us in total darkness. 

SANCTUM_DVS324
01:04:50,00 --> 01:04:56,50
Now, SOMEONE<Carl> snaps photographs of the cave walls. 

SANCTUM_DVS325
01:04:53,00 --> 01:04:58,50
SOMEONE<Victoria> sits on a boulder nearby. 

SANCTUM_DVS326
01:04:58,00 --> 01:05:05,50
As SOMEONE<Carl> returns with his camera, SOMEONE<Frank> notices him. 

SANCTUM_DVS327
01:05:05,00 --> 01:05:10,50
SOMEONE<Josh> hands supplies up to his father. 

SANCTUM_DVS328
01:05:30,00 --> 01:05:35,50
SOMEONE<Josh> looks on uncertainly. 

SANCTUM_DVS329
01:05:32,00 --> 01:05:38,50
His father leaves SOMEONE<Carl> who sits up, wincing. 

SANCTUM_DVS330
01:05:59,00 --> 01:06:07,50
A mildly defiant grin fades from SOMEONE's<Victoria's> face. SOMEONE<Carl> rubs his neck. 

SANCTUM_DVS331
01:06:14,00 --> 01:06:20,50
A slack-jawed SOMEONE<Carl> drops his hand on his lap. 

SANCTUM_DVS332
01:06:18,00 --> 01:06:27,50
He looks at SOMEONE<Frank> who sadly gazes at the floor. SOMEONE<Victoria> squeezes SOMEONE's<Carl's> shoulder then leaves his side. 

SANCTUM_DVS333
01:06:34,00 --> 01:06:40,50
SOMEONE<Frank> fixes the collar of his vest and hangs his head. 

SANCTUM_DVS334
01:06:40,00 --> 01:06:53,50
Now, SOMEONE<Josh> marches alone through another cavern, his helmet light shines over a winding path through the uneven rock floor. SOMEONE's<Frank's> light shines about 50 yards up ahead. 

SANCTUM_DVS335
01:07:03,00 --> 01:07:08,50
SOMEONE<Frank> appears just inside it. 

SANCTUM_DVS336
01:07:07,00 --> 01:07:16,50
The veteran caver peers through the opening into another darkened chamber. He sets down his yellow supply bag. 

SANCTUM_DVS337
01:07:15,00 --> 01:07:28,50
Catch up and set down their own gear. As SOMEONE<Frank> crawls through the opening, his helmet light dims out. He holds his hand before it to verify. SOMEONE<Victoria> and SOMEONE<Josh> rest. 

SANCTUM_DVS339
01:07:44,00 --> 01:07:52,50
Walls bears some irregularities. SOMEONE<Frank> spots a ledge and opening across the cauldron. 

SANCTUM_DVS340
01:07:51,00 --> 01:07:57,50
Out of the trickling chamber, SOMEONE<Carl> peers into it. 

SANCTUM_DVS341
01:07:57,00 --> 01:08:02,50
SOMEONE<Victoria> blows on her hands. 

SANCTUM_DVS342
01:08:34,00 --> 01:08:39,50
SOMEONE<Carl> hugs SOMEONE<Victoria>. 

SANCTUM_DVS343
01:09:09,00 --> 01:09:19,50
Later in the cauldron chamber, SOMEONE<Josh> hangs from a rope and harness. The others watch him through the oval hole. 

SANCTUM_DVS345
01:09:27,00 --> 01:09:31,50
He goes to another ledge below. 

SANCTUM_DVS346
01:09:30,00 --> 01:09:36,50
Water rains down on him. SOMEONE<Frank> feeds out some slack. 

SANCTUM_DVS348
01:09:38,00 --> 01:09:45,50
To some coiled rope on his hip. The young man scans the chamber walls. 

SANCTUM_DVS349
01:09:45,00 --> 01:09:53,50
Down at the churning pool, gets a hold on the wall, and leans out far under a light waterfall. 

SANCTUM_DVS351
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:10,50
SOMEONE<Frank> gives him some more slack and SOMEONE<Josh> repositions himself on the ledge. 

SANCTUM_DVS355
01:10:22,00 --> 01:10:28,50
He extends his left foot to another crag about three feet away. 

SANCTUM_DVS360
01:10:59,00 --> 01:11:07,50
He feeds him a few more inches. SOMEONE<Josh> finds a secure position and studies the wall. 

SANCTUM_DVS364
01:11:24,00 --> 01:11:28,50
He keep kimself onto the ledge. 

SANCTUM_DVS365
01:11:29,00 --> 01:11:33,50
Water splashes from below. 

SANCTUM_DVS367
01:11:46,00 --> 01:11:51,50
SOMEONE<Frank> looks up from the ledge below. 

SANCTUM_DVS368
01:12:03,00 --> 01:12:07,50
SOMEONE<Carl> and SOMEONE<Josh> on the other side. 

SANCTUM_DVS370
01:12:30,00 --> 01:12:35,50
SOMEONE<Carl> shines a flashlight on her. 

SANCTUM_DVS373
01:14:20,00 --> 01:14:30,50
Now, as SOMEONE<Frank> coils a handful of rope, he glances at SOMEONE<Carl> who stares off with a stunned gaze, his head propped on his hand. 

SANCTUM_DVS374
01:14:29,00 --> 01:14:38,50
SOMEONE<Carl> shoots SOMEONE<Frank> a disbelieving glance. SOMEONE<Frank> sets down his ropes and looks across the way. 

SANCTUM_DVS375
01:14:37,00 --> 01:14:47,50
His son sits on a ledge, his mouth set in a line and his eyes staring blankly. SOMEONE's<Frank's> chest heaves. 

SANCTUM_DVS376
01:14:49,00 --> 01:14:54,50
SOMEONE<Carl> glares at him. 

SANCTUM_DVS377
01:15:06,00 --> 01:15:12,50
Tears stream down SOMEONE's<Carl's> cheeks. 

SANCTUM_DVS378
01:15:11,00 --> 01:15:16,50
His face hardens. 

SANCTUM_DVS379
01:15:15,00 --> 01:15:20,50
SOMEONE<Frank> glances away. 

SANCTUM_DVS380
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:28,50
SOMEONE's<Josh's> brow furrows. 

SANCTUM_DVS381
01:15:27,00 --> 01:15:32,50
SOMEONE<Frank> meets his gaze and holds it. 

SANCTUM_DVS382
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:36,50
He sits on a ledge below Josh's, resting his hands on his knee. 

SANCTUM_DVS383
01:16:11,00 --> 01:16:16,50
He shifts his eyes. 

SANCTUM_DVS384
01:16:20,00 --> 01:16:28,50
Under his father's steady gaze, SOMEONE's<Josh's> chin trembles. His face contorts in anguish. 

SANCTUM_DVS385
01:16:30,00 --> 01:16:38,50
SOMEONE<Frank> moves to his son's ledge and crouches. He places a hand on SOMEONE's<Josh's> shoulder. 

SANCTUM_DVS386
01:16:37,00 --> 01:16:41,50
He rubs his cheek. 

SANCTUM_DVS387
01:16:41,00 --> 01:16:47,50
Pulling SOMEONE<Josh> close, he hugs him. 

SANCTUM_DVS388
01:16:50,00 --> 01:16:54,50
Squeezes his eyes shut. 

SANCTUM_DVS389
01:16:55,00 --> 01:17:00,50
SOMEONE<Carl> glares at the father and son. 

SANCTUM_DVS390
01:17:03,00 --> 01:17:08,50
Shifting his jaw, SOMEONE<Josh> pulls away. 

SANCTUM_DVS391
01:17:07,00 --> 01:17:13,50
He meets his father's gaze and nods. 

SANCTUM_DVS396
01:17:36,00 --> 01:17:42,50
SOMEONE<Carl> stumbles as he makes his way over the uneven ground. 

SANCTUM_DVS397
01:17:40,00 --> 01:17:54,50
Trudging past stalagmites, he and SOMEONE<Josh> find an underwater cave on the opposite side of the chamber. At the water's edge, SOMEONE<Carl> bends at the waist, resting his hands on his legs. 

SANCTUM_DVS398
01:17:56,00 --> 01:18:01,50
As they stare at the dark water, SOMEONE<Frank> joins them. 

SANCTUM_DVS399
01:18:00,00 --> 01:18:08,50
He scans the submerged cave, then takes off his bag and lets it fall to the ground. 

SANCTUM_DVS402
01:18:39,00 --> 01:18:43,50
He dives into the water. 

SANCTUM_DVS403
01:18:42,00 --> 01:18:51,50
As SOMEONE<Carl> swims around a corner in a narrow passageway, SOMEONE<Frank> catches up and grabs on to his leg. 

SANCTUM_DVS406
01:19:10,00 --> 01:19:16,50
But finds the cave ceiling above, holding him underwater. 

SANCTUM_DVS407
01:19:18,00 --> 01:19:23,50
His hands feeling for a break in the rock. 

SANCTUM_DVS408
01:19:24,00 --> 01:19:29,50
SOMEONE<Josh> eyes the water surface. 

SANCTUM_DVS410
01:19:36,00 --> 01:19:43,50
Path of light pierces the darkness at the cave's entrance and he swims toward it. 

SANCTUM_DVS414
01:20:14,00 --> 01:20:20,50
His own headlamp off his helmet and replaces it with his son's. 

SANCTUM_DVS415
01:20:21,00 --> 01:20:26,50
SOMEONE<Josh> shifts his somber eyes. 

SANCTUM_DVS416
01:20:34,00 --> 01:20:39,50
SOMEONE<Frank> stares off. 

SANCTUM_DVS417
01:20:47,00 --> 01:20:53,50
SOMEONE's<Frank's> lips spread into a smile and he nods. 

SANCTUM_DVS418
01:20:52,00 --> 01:20:57,50
He gives a wide grin. 

SANCTUM_DVS419
01:20:57,00 --> 01:21:01,50
SOMEONE<Josh> looks away. 

SANCTUM_DVS420
01:21:00,00 --> 01:21:12,50
Pushing out his jaw, he gives a thoughtful look, then abruptly shifts his gaze to a section of the cave's wall near SOMEONE<Frank>. He stands, sniffing the air. 

SANCTUM_DVS421
01:21:10,00 --> 01:21:22,50
SOMEONE watches his son head to an eye-level cavity in the rock. Reaching inside, SOMEONE touches a dark, muddy substance, then lifts his fingers to his nose. 

SANCTUM_DVS422
01:21:20,00 --> 01:21:28,50
Smiling, he turns to his father and smears some of the sludge on his cheek. SOMEONE<Frank> looks up. 

SANCTUM_DVS423
01:21:27,00 --> 01:21:32,50
He joins SOMEONE<Josh> by the cavity. 

SANCTUM_DVS424
01:21:39,00 --> 01:21:43,50
Self into the hole. 

SANCTUM_DVS425
01:21:41,00 --> 01:21:51,50
Later, he and SOMEONE<Josh> climb a narrow gap between two rock faces, pressing their backs to one and gripping the other with their hands and feet. 

SANCTUM_DVS426
01:21:57,00 --> 01:22:02,50
Lifting his foot, SOMEONE<Josh> finds a hold. 

SANCTUM_DVS427
01:22:01,00 --> 01:22:06,50
SOMEONE<Frank> grabs a piece of jutting rock. 

SANCTUM_DVS428
01:22:09,00 --> 01:22:14,50
SOMEONE<Josh> straightens, pushing himself higher. 

SANCTUM_DVS429
01:22:14,00 --> 01:22:19,50
SOMEONE<Frank> rests his back on the rock. 

SANCTUM_DVS430
01:22:18,00 --> 01:22:22,50
He leans against his arm. 

SANCTUM_DVS431
01:22:22,00 --> 01:22:31,50
Drops of water splash against their helmets, SOMEONE<Josh> turns to his father and meets his gaze with a broad grin. 

SANCTUM_DVS432
01:22:30,00 --> 01:22:40,50
He blinks against the falling water, his chest heaving. As his son's light glows on his face, SOMEONE<Frank> looks away and swallows. 

SANCTUM_DVS433
01:22:40,00 --> 01:22:45,50
He resumes climbing. 

SANCTUM_DVS434
01:22:53,00 --> 01:22:59,50
The climbers' lights as they ascend the narrow chimney. 

SANCTUM_DVS435
01:23:05,00 --> 01:23:10,50
His body to bridge the gap. 

SANCTUM_DVS436
01:23:08,00 --> 01:23:15,50
With a hand gripping each rock face, SOMEONE steps on to his father's thigh, 

SANCTUM_DVS437
01:23:19,00 --> 01:23:26,50
body, and grabs a ledge. SOMEONE<Frank> grits his teeth as SOMEONE's<Josh's> weight bears down on him. 

SANCTUM_DVS438
01:23:25,00 --> 01:23:29,50
SOMEONE<Josh> pulls himself onto the ledge. 

SANCTUM_DVS443
01:24:07,00 --> 01:24:13,50
The light on SOMEONE's<Josh's> helmet torch fades out. 

SANCTUM_DVS444
01:24:15,00 --> 01:24:21,50
He checks for his light's reflection on his palm. 

SANCTUM_DVS445
01:24:22,00 --> 01:24:29,50
SOMEONE<Frank> lifts his hand to the light on his own helmet and switches it off. 

SANCTUM_DVS446
01:24:27,00 --> 01:24:32,50
Darkness envelopes the climbers. 

SANCTUM_DVS447
01:24:31,00 --> 01:24:40,50
Now, SOMEONE's<Frank's> helmet light emerges from darkness, illuminating the walls of a tunnel as he crawls through it. 

SANCTUM_DVS448
01:24:38,00 --> 01:24:45,50
Follows without a light, his figure disappearing in the blackness behind his father. 

SANCTUM_DVS449
01:24:44,00 --> 01:24:50,50
Ahead, the walls of the tunnel widen and the ceiling rises slightly. 

SANCTUM_DVS450
01:24:48,00 --> 01:24:54,50
As SOMEONE<Frank> moves forward, his light fades out. 

SANCTUM_DVS452
01:24:59,00 --> 01:25:11,50
He turns on his wristwatch's light and it glows on his determined face. Holding its button down, he creeps forward, no longer crawling but crouched under the low ceiling. 

SANCTUM_DVS453
01:25:12,00 --> 01:25:17,50
He stumbles, then winces and stops walking. 

SANCTUM_DVS454
01:25:15,00 --> 01:25:21,50
SOMEONE<Josh> pauses beside him and SOMEONE<Frank> shoots him a glance. 

SANCTUM_DVS455
01:25:22,00 --> 01:25:30,50
He lowers himself to the ground and leans against the tunnel's wall, then releases the button for his watch light. 

SANCTUM_DVS456
01:25:31,00 --> 01:25:38,50
As SOMEONE<Josh> lifts his hand, a trace of light reflects on his palm and fingers. 

SANCTUM_DVS457
01:25:36,00 --> 01:25:41,50
He shifts his gaze to SOMEONE<Frank>. 

SANCTUM_DVS458
01:25:42,00 --> 01:25:53,50
SOMEONE<Frank> looks at his son, his profile traced in a glimmer of light. The climber stare down the tunnel where more light gleams of its jagged walls. 

SANCTUM_DVS459
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:59,50
Daylight bathes their faces as they emerge from a fissure and step into a cavern. 

SANCTUM_DVS460
01:25:59,00 --> 01:26:07,50
At its center, a brilliant shaft of sunlight glows down through a hole in its high ceiling. 

SANCTUM_DVS461
01:26:05,00 --> 01:26:10,50
As they walk toward it, SOMEONE<Frank> removes his helmet. 

SANCTUM_DVS462
01:26:11,00 --> 01:26:21,50
SOMEONE<Josh> removes his helmet as well and his father lifts his face to the hole. Insects flutter around the blazing sunbeam. 

SANCTUM_DVS463
01:26:21,00 --> 01:26:27,50
Above ground, vegetation lines the hole's perimeter. 

SANCTUM_DVS464
01:26:25,00 --> 01:26:34,50
SOMEONE<Josh> lowers his gaze from the natural skylight and notices a weathered military vehicle sitting below it. 

SANCTUM_DVS465
01:26:42,00 --> 01:26:47,50
SOMEONE<Frank> climbs on to the tank. 

SANCTUM_DVS466
01:26:45,00 --> 01:26:51,50
He peers down its hatch, then straightens. 

SANCTUM_DVS467
01:26:50,00 --> 01:26:56,50
Rain falls on SOMEONE's<Josh's> face as he looks up. 

SANCTUM_DVS468
01:27:01,00 --> 01:27:11,50
Leaps off the tank, landing in soft, muddy ground. Together, he and SOMEONE<Josh> crouch and examine some skeletal remains. 

SANCTUM_DVS469
01:27:09,00 --> 01:27:19,50
Later, a view through the skylight shows towering trees below a cloudy sky. Pale light glimmers on raindrop 

SANCTUM_DVS470
01:27:16,00 --> 01:27:31,50
as they fall into the cavern. Squatting, SOMEONE<Frank> fills a container with oil from the tank, then looks over at SOMEONE<Josh> who strikes a flint under the shelter of a wheel well. He lights a makeshift torch then grins. 

SANCTUM_DVS471
01:27:32,00 --> 01:27:43,50
As SOMEONE<Josh> rises with his flaming cylindrical container in hand, SOMEONE<Frank> shoves fabric into the top of his own oil-filled container. 

SANCTUM_DVS472
01:28:05,00 --> 01:28:12,50
SOMEONE<Josh> lights his father's torch with his own and they lift them as if toasting. 

SANCTUM_DVS473
01:28:15,00 --> 01:28:21,50
With a thoughtful frown, SOMEONE<Josh> glances at his father. 

SANCTUM_DVS474
01:28:20,00 --> 01:28:29,50
Now, a wide view shows pale light shining through the hole casting the cavern in a purple-tinged glow. 

SANCTUM_DVS475
01:28:27,00 --> 01:28:42,50
Holding his makeshift torch, SOMEONE<Frank> glances around and follows his son into a tunnel. As the light from his flame disappears, our view glides to writing etched in the side of the tank, "Frank and SOMEONE<Josh> were here. See ya. " 

SANCTUM_DVS476
01:28:41,00 --> 01:28:55,50
Later, orange light from SOMEONE's<Josh's> torch flickers on the rock walls as he leads his father through the tunnel. It widens and he climbs down a ledge, his eyes squinting into a dim chamber. 

SANCTUM_DVS477
01:28:55,00 --> 01:29:00,50
Smiling, he crouches beside a body of water. 

SANCTUM_DVS478
01:29:00,00 --> 01:29:05,50
Slipping, SOMEONE<Frank> slides down the ledge on his rear. 

SANCTUM_DVS479
01:29:04,00 --> 01:29:08,50
SOMEONE<Josh> looks over. 

SANCTUM_DVS480
01:29:14,00 --> 01:29:21,50
SOMEONE<Josh> rises and SOMEONE<Frank> shifts his helmet as his son follows the river. 

SANCTUM_DVS481
01:29:18,00 --> 01:29:27,50
Now with their torches held out, the climbers take careful steps shuffling across muddy ground. 

SANCTUM_DVS482
01:29:25,00 --> 01:29:35,50
Looking down, SOMEONE<Josh> pauses and furrows his brow. He crouches to examine some abandoned gear. 

SANCTUM_DVS483
01:29:36,00 --> 01:29:46,50
He glances at SOMEONE<Frank> who drops his supply bag and crouches by the equipment as well. Setting down his torch, he checks a gauge. 

SANCTUM_DVS484
01:29:47,00 --> 01:29:52,50
He test a dive light. 

SANCTUM_DVS485
01:29:51,00 --> 01:29:59,50
Now, SOMEONE's<Josh's> feet splash in shallow water as they hike into another chamber. 

SANCTUM_DVS486
01:30:08,00 --> 01:30:13,50
Their light shine on SOMEONE<Carl>. 

SANCTUM_DVS487
01:30:15,00 --> 01:30:23,50
Smeared in dirt, SOMEONE<Carl> grins as he crawls over to them. SOMEONE<Josh> glares down at him. 

SANCTUM_DVS488
01:30:32,00 --> 01:30:37,50
SOMEONE<Frank> rolls his eyes. 

SANCTUM_DVS489
01:30:36,00 --> 01:30:41,50
He gives SOMEONE<Josh> a frenzied look. 

SANCTUM_DVS490
01:30:43,00 --> 01:30:50,50
SOMEONE<Josh> sets down his bag and SOMEONE<Carl> rummages through it, finding a bag of food. 

SANCTUM_DVS491
01:30:50,00 --> 01:30:57,50
Turning away from SOMEONE<Carl>, SOMEONE<Frank> moves through the chamber, his eyes scanning the ground. 

SANCTUM_DVS492
01:31:03,00 --> 01:31:10,50
SOMEONE's<Frank's> light falls on SOMEONE's<Victoria's> body, her eyes staring lifelessly. 

SANCTUM_DVS493
01:31:08,00 --> 01:31:16,50
SOMEONE's<Carl's> expression crumbles and SOMEONE<Josh> turns to see SOMEONE's<Victoria's> pale and swollen face. 

SANCTUM_DVS494
01:31:21,00 --> 01:31:27,50
Dribbles a handful of dried food into his mouth. 

SANCTUM_DVS495
01:31:32,00 --> 01:31:39,50
Gaze at SOMEONE's<Carl's> discarded rebreather pack, SOMEONE<Frank> finds three light sticks inside. 

SANCTUM_DVS496
01:31:39,00 --> 01:31:46,50
As SOMEONE<Carl> shoves more food into his mouth, SOMEONE<Frank> rises. 

SANCTUM_DVS497
01:31:57,00 --> 01:32:02,50
SOMEONE<Carl> watches them leave. 

SANCTUM_DVS500
01:33:30,00 --> 01:33:36,50
SOMEONE's<Carl's> eyes widen and his grip goes slack. 

SANCTUM_DVS501
01:33:35,00 --> 01:33:40,50
Man panting beside him. 

SANCTUM_DVS503
01:34:04,00 --> 01:34:11,50
Shaking his head, SOMEONE<Frank> returns to his back, his hand pressed to his son's cheek. 

SANCTUM_DVS504
01:34:26,00 --> 01:34:31,50
SOMEONE<Frank> pats SOMEONE's<Josh's> hand. 

SANCTUM_DVS505
01:34:29,00 --> 01:34:36,50
Young man turns to see SOMEONE<Carl> rising to his feet nearby holding a glow stick. 

SANCTUM_DVS506
01:34:48,00 --> 01:34:58,50
SOMEONE<Josh> glares. SOMEONE<Carl> averts his gaze, giving a dumbfounded shake of his head. As SOMEONE<Frank> trembles

SANCTUM_DVS507
01:34:55,00 --> 01:35:04,50
on the ground struggling to breath, SOMEONE<Carl> watches, heaving a sigh. Tears well in his eyes. 

SANCTUM_DVS508
01:35:05,00 --> 01:35:11,50
As SOMEONE<Carl> steps away, SOMEONE's<Josh's> glare follows him. 

SANCTUM_DVS509
01:35:11,00 --> 01:35:22,50
SOMEONE<Carl> shrugs with resignation, shaking his head at the cave walls. He dives into the pool and disappears. 

SANCTUM_DVS510
01:35:22,00 --> 01:35:27,50
SOMEONE<Josh> stares after him. 

SANCTUM_DVS511
01:35:26,00 --> 01:35:33,50
His father's side, SOMEONE<Josh> drops to his knees and cradles his head in his hand. 

SANCTUM_DVS512
01:35:34,00 --> 01:35:39,50
SOMEONE<Frank> grimaces. 

SANCTUM_DVS513
01:35:38,00 --> 01:35:43,50
SOMEONE<Josh> lowers him into the pool. 

SANCTUM_DVS514
01:35:45,00 --> 01:35:49,50
Gently supports SOMEONE's<Frank's> head. 

SANCTUM_DVS515
01:35:47,00 --> 01:35:53,50
SOMEONE<Frank> lies flat, buoyed by the water. 

SANCTUM_DVS516
01:36:30,00 --> 01:36:34,50
Sobbing, SOMEONE<Josh> shakes his head. 

SANCTUM_DVS517
01:36:54,00 --> 01:37:01,50
As SOMEONE's<Frank's> hand grips his son's arm, SOMEONE's<Josh's> lips tremble. 

SANCTUM_DVS518
01:36:59,00 --> 01:37:10,50
Meanwhile in the underwater cave, SOMEONE<Carl>, illuminated by the green light of the glow stick feels his way along the rocks above with clenched teeth. 

SANCTUM_DVS519
01:37:09,00 --> 01:37:14,50
Emerging in open water, he does a breaststroke toward the murky 

SANCTUM_DVS520
01:37:15,00 --> 01:37:23,50
Back in the cave, the oil candle's flame slowly extinguishes, leaving the area in darkness. 

SANCTUM_DVS521
01:37:23,00 --> 01:37:33,50
Break in half, bathing everything in a green glow. He sets the stick aside as his father shivers in the water. 

SANCTUM_DVS522
01:37:31,00 --> 01:37:38,50
Nods slowly. SOMEONE's<Josh's> pursed lips form a brief, loving smile. 

SANCTUM_DVS523
01:37:36,00 --> 01:37:41,50
He sets his jaw. 

SANCTUM_DVS524
01:37:38,00 --> 01:37:45,50
SOMEONE<Josh> lays his forearm below SOMEONE's<Frank's> chin and gently applies pressure. 

SANCTUM_DVS525
01:37:45,00 --> 01:37:53,50
Underwater, a flurry of bubbles rises. SOMEONE<Josh> struggles to hold back sobs. 

SANCTUM_DVS528
01:38:07,00 --> 01:38:15,50
Now in slow motion, submerged under gently lapping ripples, SOMEONE's<Frank's> grip loosens on his son. 

SANCTUM_DVS529
01:38:14,00 --> 01:38:20,50
SOMEONE<Josh> looks down at him, lips parted. 

SANCTUM_DVS530
01:38:19,00 --> 01:38:26,50
He withdraws his hand from his father's, letting it fall back into the murk. 

SANCTUM_DVS531
01:38:27,00 --> 01:38:38,50
SOMEONE's<Frank's> right hand half-rises from the cloudy water. Sliding his hand from his father's forehead, SOMEONE<Josh> lifts his body to the surface. 

SANCTUM_DVS532
01:38:37,00 --> 01:38:45,50
Under the green illumination of the glow stick, the young man blinks, gazing sadly. 

SANCTUM_DVS533
01:38:47,00 --> 01:38:56,50
With one hand pressed to his father's chest, SOMEONE<Josh> bends down and plants a tender kiss on his forehead. 

SANCTUM_DVS534
01:38:55,00 --> 01:39:03,50
He rises, drawing his arms back and allows his father's body to float away. 

SANCTUM_DVS536
01:39:15,00 --> 01:39:23,50
Now underwater, SOMEONE<Josh> emerges from a cavern, clutching a glow stick and the air cylinder. 

SANCTUM_DVS537
01:39:21,00 --> 01:39:28,50
Rise from the valve as he raises it to his lips and takes a hit. 

SANCTUM_DVS538
01:39:34,00 --> 01:39:39,50
SOMEONE<Josh> inhales once again from the tank. 

SANCTUM_DVS539
01:39:45,00 --> 01:39:53,50
Coming out from around a bulging rock, he sees SOMEONE's<Carl's> body wedged against the ceiling up ahead. 

SANCTUM_DVS540
01:39:52,00 --> 01:39:59,50
SOMEONE<Josh> crawls over jagged rocks beneath SOMEONE's<Carl's> lifeless, dangling arms. 

SANCTUM_DVS542
01:40:06,00 --> 01:40:12,50
Now, SOMEONE<Josh> arrives at a narrow crevasse. 

SANCTUM_DVS543
01:40:11,00 --> 01:40:17,50
He takes another hit from the tank, then continues on. 

SANCTUM_DVS544
01:40:18,00 --> 01:40:26,50
Further on, SOMEONE<Josh> stares resolutely forward as he feels his way along the jagged. 

SANCTUM_DVS545
01:40:26,00 --> 01:40:30,50
Glow stick dies out. 

SANCTUM_DVS546
01:40:36,00 --> 01:40:43,50
Now, SOMEONE<Josh> clutches the boar tooth torch which emits a soft, warm glow. 

SANCTUM_DVS547
01:40:43,00 --> 01:40:50,50
Kicking his flippers, he continues on along a rocky passage. 

SANCTUM_DVS548
01:40:52,00 --> 01:40:58,50
As SOMEONE<Josh> squeezes through a small opening, he raises the canister valve. 

SANCTUM_DVS549
01:41:03,00 --> 01:41:09,50
Narrow as he furiously twist the nozzle, then discards the tank. 

SANCTUM_DVS550
01:41:07,00 --> 01:41:15,50
With his cheeks puffed out, he edges his way up along a jutting wall of rock. 

SANCTUM_DVS551
01:41:17,00 --> 01:41:25,50
These bubbles emerge from small craters. SOMEONE<Josh> crawls over and presses his lips to one. 

SANCTUM_DVS554
01:41:33,00 --> 01:41:39,50
From above, SOMEONE's<Josh's> face breaks the water's surface. 

SANCTUM_DVS555
01:41:38,00 --> 01:41:42,50
Inhales deeply from another air bubble. 

SANCTUM_DVS557
01:41:46,00 --> 01:41:53,50
A distant bluish light expands and shines across the big shape of SOMEONE's<Josh's> body. 

SANCTUM_DVS558
01:41:51,00 --> 01:41:57,50
Wincing, he re-submerges with a shake of his head. 

SANCTUM_DVS559
01:41:56,00 --> 01:42:04,50
As his near-motionless body rotates underwater, the young man shuts his eyes. 

SANCTUM_DVS560
01:42:03,00 --> 01:42:08,50
He begins to sink downward. 

SANCTUM_DVS561
01:42:07,00 --> 01:42:12,50
His body wavers. 

SANCTUM_DVS562
01:42:13,00 --> 01:42:18,50
Now, SOMEONE<Frank> appears wearing his helmet light. 

SANCTUM_DVS563
01:42:16,00 --> 01:42:20,50
He smiles. 

SANCTUM_DVS564
01:42:18,00 --> 01:42:27,50
A view from underwater reveals shafts of light breaking on the pool's surface, cutting through the murk from a crevasse above.
