SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS36
00:02:45,00 --> 00:02:54,50
Now, in a club, two women in old-fashioned costumes perform a traditional dance with fans in front of a DJ. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS37
00:02:51,00 --> 00:02:58,50
Amid dancing guests, Sebastian and SOMEONE<Nina> chat with their boss and a grey-haired man. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS38
00:02:56,00 --> 00:03:04,50
Outside, a young woman in a bulky knit cap with a pompom on top makes a call on her cellphone. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS39
00:03:01,00 --> 00:03:08,50
She wears her hair loose around her round, soft features. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS40
00:03:13,00 --> 00:03:19,50
She looks up at the club with a furrowed brow. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS41
00:03:16,00 --> 00:03:21,50
The young woman heaves a grim sigh. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS42
00:03:18,00 --> 00:03:24,50
Her eyes fixed on the club, she lowers the phone sadly. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS43
00:03:22,00 --> 00:03:29,50
Now, traffic speeds along an overpass beneath the dark nighttime sky. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS44
00:03:26,00 --> 00:03:31,50
In the far right lane, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS45
00:03:28,00 --> 00:03:33,50
the casually dressed young woman rides a bicycle. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS46
00:03:31,00 --> 00:03:36,50
Her feet work the pedals in a steady rhythm, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS47
00:03:33,00 --> 00:03:38,50
her tasseled scarf billowing behind her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS49
00:03:37,00 --> 00:03:42,50
At a turn, she narrowly avoids a bus and a taxi. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS50
00:03:39,00 --> 00:03:45,50
Her front wheel weaves unsteadily along the pavement. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS51
00:03:42,00 --> 00:03:49,50
As cars whisk past at high speed, she reaches a busy street. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS53
00:03:48,00 --> 00:03:52,50
As we ride with her, the vehicles blur and distort. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS54
00:03:50,00 --> 00:03:54,50
Flashing headlights fill our view. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS56
00:03:57,00 --> 00:04:01,50
Now, we gaze out over the city. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS57
00:03:59,00 --> 00:04:05,50
In a dark bedroom, a cellphone lights up on a night stand. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS58
00:04:09,00 --> 00:04:15,50
In bed, SOMEONE<Nina> nestles close to Sebastian. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS59
00:04:12,00 --> 00:04:17,50
She stirs, wakes, and picks up the cellphone. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS60
00:04:15,00 --> 00:04:21,50
The young woman glances at her sleeping partner as she answers. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS61
00:04:33,00 --> 00:04:37,50
SOMEONE<Nina> gets up. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS62
00:04:34,00 --> 00:04:40,50
Subtitles. Miss SOMEONE<Liao> is on her bike and was hit by a taxi. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS63
00:04:46,00 --> 00:04:52,50
SOMEONE<Nina> anxiously ends the call. Daytime. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS64
00:04:49,00 --> 00:04:57,50
We gaze past the Oriental Pearl Tower and the adjacent Huangpu River to the hazy city. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS65
00:04:54,00 --> 00:05:02,50
Traffic moves smoothly along the streets. At Hongking Hospital, SOMEONE<Nina> bumps into a nurse. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS66
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:05,50
Reaching a hall, she peers down one end. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS67
00:05:02,00 --> 00:05:09,50
Looking the other way, she breaks into a jog and joins a tall woman. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS68
00:05:08,00 --> 00:05:13,50
The woman faces a window to a room. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS69
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:18,50
Following her gaze, SOMEONE<Nina> finds an unconscious SOMEONE<Sophia> covered in casts and bandages. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS70
00:05:15,00 --> 00:05:21,50
SOMEONE<Nina> enters the room and leans over the injured woman. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS71
00:05:18,00 --> 00:05:24,50
She reaches down to touch her but her hand hovers inches away. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS72
00:05:28,00 --> 00:05:33,50
SOMEONE<Nina> straightens and shifts on her feet. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS73
00:05:32,00 --> 00:05:38,50
She brings the back of her hand to her mouth and squeezes her eyes shut. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS74
00:05:36,00 --> 00:05:41,50
Swaying unsteadily, she turns away. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS75
00:05:41,00 --> 00:05:47,50
SOMEONE<Nina> leans against the bed rail in a grief-stricken slouch. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS76
00:05:51,00 --> 00:05:56,50
Later, she sits by a window. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS78
00:05:56,00 --> 00:06:00,50
She stares vacantly. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS83
00:06:07,00 --> 00:06:15,50
In a sunlit living room, SOMEONE<Sophia> and SOMEONE<Nina> dance around as teenagers. Words appear. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS84
00:06:12,00 --> 00:06:17,50
1997, Shanghai. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS85
00:06:15,00 --> 00:06:22,50
Clad in matching red and white tracksuits, they snack on buns out of a brown paper bag. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS87
00:06:24,00 --> 00:06:29,50
An elegant older woman marches in. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS89
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:37,50
She takes the bag and holds it up. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS90
00:06:34,00 --> 00:06:39,50
SOMEONE<Nina> timidly avoids her gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS93
00:06:45,00 --> 00:06:51,50
She takes SOMEONE's<Sophia's> hand. The girl yanks it free. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS95
00:06:54,00 --> 00:06:59,50
The stepmother faces SOMEONE's<Sophia's> friend. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS99
00:07:01,00 --> 00:07:05,50
She marches out. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS100
00:07:03,00 --> 00:07:09,50
SOMEONE<Nina> starts to follow, but SOMEONE<Sophia> discreetly steps in her path. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS101
00:07:09,00 --> 00:07:15,50
SOMEONE<Nina> slips past her, gazing after the older woman. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS102
00:07:12,00 --> 00:07:18,50
Facing SOMEONE<Sophia>, she sticks out her tongue. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS103
00:07:15,00 --> 00:07:20,50
Her friends nods and gives her an encouraging push. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS104
00:07:18,00 --> 00:07:23,50
Now, SOMEONE's<Sophia's> stepmother plays a record. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS107
00:07:24,00 --> 00:07:31,50
Leaving the turntable, she starts to cross the tastefully decorated room. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS108
00:07:28,00 --> 00:07:33,50
She pauses and faces her guest. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS109
00:07:31,00 --> 00:07:36,50
Leaning against a far wall, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS110
00:07:33,00 --> 00:07:39,50
SOMEONE<Nina> reluctantly shuffles over to the older woman. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS111
00:07:36,00 --> 00:07:41,50
As she gets closer, she stares at the floor. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS113
00:07:42,00 --> 00:07:46,50
The stepmother moves in close. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS115
00:07:46,00 --> 00:07:53,50
A smart girl like you with a bright future shouldn't have to spend all your time with her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS116
00:07:51,00 --> 00:07:59,50
The stepmother leans in intimidatingly, a SOMEONE<frosty> smile plastered on her exquisitely made up features. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS117
00:07:56,00 --> 00:08:03,50
As she speaks, SOMEONE<Nina> stares at her stained teeth and painted lips. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS118
00:08:01,00 --> 00:08:06,50
Now, we peer out a window. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS119
00:08:04,00 --> 00:08:10,50
SOMEONE's<Nina's> eyes rise into view and she peeks inside. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS120
00:08:07,00 --> 00:08:12,50
She scans the area carefully. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS122
00:08:11,00 --> 00:08:16,50
She slips a note in between the pane and the sill, and gently pounds the window frame. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS123
00:08:16,00 --> 00:08:22,50
With a faint mischievous smirk, she sinks out of view. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS124
00:08:19,00 --> 00:08:25,50
Now huddled by the window, SOMEONE<Sophia> opens the note. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS125
00:08:22,00 --> 00:08:29,50
The SOMEONE<Han> characters translate to "Come and meet my family for dinner". 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS127
00:08:28,00 --> 00:08:32,50
SOMEONE<Sophia> beams softly, folds the note shut, and gazes out the window with a hopeful smile. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS129
00:08:32,00 --> 00:08:37,50
Now, the two friends walk down a narrow alley. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS131
00:08:36,00 --> 00:08:43,50
Holding SOMEONE's<Sophia's> hand, SOMEONE<Nina> leads her through a doorway and across a small courtyard. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS132
00:08:42,00 --> 00:08:46,50
Now, at a humble kitchen table. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS133
00:08:49,00 --> 00:08:54,50
SOMEONE's<Nina's> father smiles with the girls. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS135
00:08:53,00 --> 00:09:00,50
Her mother brings a small pot and lifts the lid. SOMEONE<Sophia> inhales the steam. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS137
00:09:05,00 --> 00:09:09,50
SOMEONE<Nina> serves her friend a dumpling. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS143
00:09:35,00 --> 00:09:42,50
Now, a long reed with a heavy bud at the end taps on SOMEONE's<Sophia's> window. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS144
00:09:39,00 --> 00:09:44,50
Clutching it, SOMEONE<Nina> also holds an umbrella. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS145
00:09:42,00 --> 00:09:47,50
A pretty, young woman opens the window and the girl ducks down. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS147
00:09:59,00 --> 00:10:06,50
Sitting close to her aunt, SOMEONE<Sophia> notices an antique slipper the size of a small child's foot. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS148
00:10:18,00 --> 00:10:22,50
Three-inch golden lilies. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS149
00:10:44,00 --> 00:10:48,50
SOMEONE<Nina> and SOMEONE<Sophia> share a look. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS150
00:10:48,00 --> 00:10:54,50
They hook pinkies. Now, at a modest office, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS151
00:11:25,00 --> 00:11:30,50
a man at a desk hands the girls a CD case. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS155
00:11:33,00 --> 00:11:39,50
SOMEONE<Nina> takes up a pen and signs the bottom. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS156
00:11:36,00 --> 00:11:42,50
She passes the contract to SOMEONE<Sophia>, who adds her signature. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS157
00:11:44,00 --> 00:11:53,50
In the present day, SOMEONE<Nina> sits by SOMEONE's<Sophia's> hospital bed, thoughtfully reading through some papers as sunlight pours in through the windows. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS158
00:11:51,00 --> 00:11:56,50
A woman in a white coat arrives. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS159
00:11:56,00 --> 00:12:01,50
SOMEONE's<Sophia's> bag is at reception. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS161
00:12:02,00 --> 00:12:08,50
SOMEONE<Nina> smiles politely and the hospital staffer goes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS162
00:12:05,00 --> 00:12:12,50
The young professional flips through a few more papers, then flips their binder shut. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS163
00:12:10,00 --> 00:12:20,50
Now, SOMEONE's<Nina's> hand gingerly pulls open a large black leather satchel and finds the items within encased in clear plastic bags. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS165
00:12:18,00 --> 00:12:24,50
she finds a stack of orange and white note cards. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS166
00:12:21,00 --> 00:12:26,50
SOMEONE<Nina> sets it aside with a puzzled frown. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS167
00:12:24,00 --> 00:12:30,50
Digging deeper in the satchel, she pulls out a dark gray garment. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS168
00:12:27,00 --> 00:12:33,50
She takes part of it from its plastic encasement. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS169
00:12:30,00 --> 00:12:35,50
It looks like a man's suit jacket. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS170
00:12:32,00 --> 00:12:39,50
SOMEONE's<Nina's> brow furrows and she continues sorting through her friend's belongings. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS171
00:12:36,00 --> 00:12:41,50
Next, she pulls out a manuscript. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS172
00:12:40,00 --> 00:12:45,50
She takes it from its bag and holds it up with a frown. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS173
00:12:45,00 --> 00:12:51,50
The cover page reads simply "Untitled by SOMEONE<Sophia> Liao". 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS174
00:12:49,00 --> 00:12:54,50
SOMEONE<Nina> flips through the pages and reads silently. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS175
00:12:57,00 --> 00:13:03,50
This is the story of SOMEONE and SOMEONE, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS176
00:13:00,00 --> 00:13:06,50
two girls born in the same month, on the same day. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS177
00:13:03,00 --> 00:13:08,50
Their feet bound on the same day. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS178
00:13:10,00 --> 00:13:14,50
Now, SOMEONE<Nina> drives. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS180
00:13:16,00 --> 00:13:20,50
SOMEONE<Nina> comes to a stop. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS181
00:13:17,00 --> 00:13:23,50
She notices a little girl in a blue tunic sitting nearby. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS182
00:13:21,00 --> 00:13:25,50
She wears her bangs short, the rest of her hair in a long braid. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS183
00:13:22,00 --> 00:13:27,50
She faces SOMEONE<Nina>, her bare feet resting on a stool. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS187
00:13:32,00 --> 00:13:39,50
Hands wrap a black swath of fabric over the girl's toes and pulls hard. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS188
00:13:38,00 --> 00:13:47,50
Another adult firmly holds the tearful recoiling girl's shoulder as the person continues binding her feet. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS189
00:13:45,00 --> 00:13:50,50
The girl looks to the woman holding her shoulder. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS193
00:14:01,00 --> 00:14:10,50
In another home, a woman squeezes a little girl's toes together as she tightly wraps a bandage around the child's foot. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS195
00:14:09,00 --> 00:14:17,50
The girl bites her lip, her eyes filling with tears, and shoots a pleading glance at a stern-faced woman watching them. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS197
00:14:22,00 --> 00:14:28,50
The stern-faced woman stares down at the seated girl. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS198
00:14:25,00 --> 00:14:31,50
The child blinks and the woman lifts her to her feet. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS200
00:14:31,00 --> 00:14:35,50
With her lips parted in pain, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS201
00:14:33,00 --> 00:14:40,50
the little girl faces a pair of doors. She takes a step, then hunches over. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS204
00:14:44,00 --> 00:14:50,50
Hobbling forward, the little girl tries to run outside. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS205
00:14:47,00 --> 00:14:52,50
A lady servant stops her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS208
00:14:53,00 --> 00:14:58,50
SOMEONE<Flower> takes small steps. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS209
00:14:59,00 --> 00:15:04,50
Only through pain SOMEONE<will> you find beauty. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS210
00:15:01,00 --> 00:15:06,50
Only through suffering SOMEONE<will> you find peace. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS211
00:15:04,00 --> 00:15:09,50
With SOMEONE<Lily> and her mother. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS214
00:15:12,00 --> 00:15:16,50
She extends her hand. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS215
00:15:16,00 --> 00:15:22,50
SOMEONE<Lily> takes a few small slow steps. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS216
00:15:19,00 --> 00:15:24,50
Her mother grabs her hand and pulls her forward. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS218
00:15:22,00 --> 00:15:26,50
SOMEONE<Lily> pushes on. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS221
00:15:28,00 --> 00:15:34,50
As the little girl turns and hobbles in the other direction, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS222
00:15:31,00 --> 00:15:36,50
her mother gives a gentle push. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS223
00:15:33,00 --> 00:15:40,50
Crisscrossed bandages around SOMEONE's<Lily's> ankles hold her bindings tight. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS225
00:15:38,00 --> 00:15:43,50
Now, in bed, SOMEONE thrashes under her covers. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS227
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:51,50
Meanwhile, at her home, SOMEONE<Lily> whimpers as she lies under a blanket on the floor. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS228
00:15:53,00 --> 00:15:59,50
Turning onto her other side, she faces a sleeping sibling. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS229
00:15:57,00 --> 00:16:05,50
One of SOMEONE's<Lily's> bound feet gets out below her blanket, its bandage is stained with blood. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS231
00:16:09,00 --> 00:16:15,50
A crowd watches as porters carry a sedan chair into their neighborhood. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS232
00:16:14,00 --> 00:16:20,50
SOMEONE's<Lily's> mother and father wait just outside their home. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS234
00:16:18,00 --> 00:16:23,50
SOMEONE<Lily> stands in the doorway with a servant. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS235
00:16:20,00 --> 00:16:29,50
A plump woman dressed in a colorful SOMEONE<Han> robe pushes aside the curtain on the enclosed litter and steps out. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS236
00:16:26,00 --> 00:16:33,50
Later, she examines SOMEONE's<Lily's> tiny, stunted foot inside her lotus shoe. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS241
00:16:48,00 --> 00:16:53,50
She leans on her cane and eyes SOMEONE<Lily>. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS250
00:17:16,00 --> 00:17:21,50
SOMEONE<Lily> blinks her solemn eyes at the matchmaker. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS252
00:17:23,00 --> 00:17:28,50
The plump woman nods, then turns to the door. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS254
00:17:28,00 --> 00:17:34,50
A servant places the privileged girl in a seat beside her new laotong. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS256
00:17:37,00 --> 00:17:44,50
SOMEONE<Flower> and SOMEONE<Lily> both stare straight ahead for a long moment, then, in unison, shift their curious eyes toward each other. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS257
00:17:43,00 --> 00:17:47,50
Now, they write at a table. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS260
00:17:52,00 --> 00:17:58,50
SOMEONE gazes across the table at SOMEONE's paper. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS263
00:18:03,00 --> 00:18:11,50
Later, as the girls lie in bed together, SOMEONE traces characters on SOMEONE's bare back. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS268
00:18:18,00 --> 00:18:25,50
Now, side by side at a water basin, they wipe their faces with wash cloths. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS269
00:18:22,00 --> 00:18:29,50
The water reflects their images. SOMEONE<Flower> with buns on either side of her head,

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS270
00:18:26,00 --> 00:18:31,50
SOMEONE<Lily> with her simple braid. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS272
00:18:29,00 --> 00:18:35,50
Snowflakes drift down and the girls try to catch them. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS273
00:18:32,00 --> 00:18:36,50
Now, they kneel at a shrine. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS274
00:18:36,00 --> 00:18:47,50
The Temple of Gupo Fair is a holy place. We are here today in front of Gupo to write your laotong contract and make your vows of eternal commitment. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS275
00:18:44,00 --> 00:18:50,50
She opens a fan with writing on it. The girls read. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS278
00:18:54,00 --> 00:18:59,50
The matchmaker closes the fan. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS279
00:18:57,00 --> 00:19:04,50
Now, the girls write side by side, their eyes intent on their careful brush strokes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS281
00:19:02,00 --> 00:19:07,50
they set their papers in a fire. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS282
00:19:04,00 --> 00:19:08,50
The matchmaker bows. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS284
00:19:06,00 --> 00:19:13,50
In the present, SOMEONE sits at SOMEONE's bedside, gazing at her unconscious friend. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS286
00:19:17,00 --> 00:19:23,50
A bedside lamp shines its harsh light on SOMEONE's<Sophia's> bruised face. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS287
00:19:21,00 --> 00:19:27,50
SOMEONE<Nina> shifts her woeful eyes to her own lap and tilts her head thoughtfully. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS288
00:19:30,00 --> 00:19:35,50
Her gaze drifts to SOMEONE's<Sophia's> hand which rests over. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS289
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:41,50
Sliding her own hand on top of her laotong's, SOMEONE<Nina> gives it a gentle squeeze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS290
00:19:40,00 --> 00:19:46,50
She clutches SOMEONE's limp hand between both of hers, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS291
00:19:43,00 --> 00:19:49,50
then rests her cheek against them and closes her eyes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS292
00:19:48,00 --> 00:19:52,50
Now, at a restaurant. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS293
00:19:50,00 --> 00:19:55,50
SOMEONE<Nina> sits across a table from her parents. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS295
00:19:54,00 --> 00:20:00,50
Her mother pauses as she eats, frowning at her daughter's sullen downcast gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS308
00:20:34,00 --> 00:20:39,50
She gives her parents a determined look. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS310
00:20:38,00 --> 00:20:43,50
SOMEONE<Nina> sits at her car, staring off absently. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS311
00:20:41,00 --> 00:20:45,50
She takes out her phone and dials. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS312
00:20:50,00 --> 00:20:55,50
She lifts it to her ear and waits. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS313
00:21:28,00 --> 00:21:32,50
She hangs up. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS315
00:21:31,00 --> 00:21:37,50
Now, at her apartment, a pile of pages from SOMEONE's<Sophia's> manuscript rests on a couch. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS316
00:21:34,00 --> 00:21:41,50
SOMEONE<Nina> sits beside it. The remaining pages settled on her crossed leg. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS317
00:21:39,00 --> 00:21:46,50
With her elbow on the arm of the couch, she props her cheek on her hand as she reads. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS318
00:21:43,00 --> 00:21:51,50
In the story, SOMEONE<Lily>, now a young woman, brushes characters onto a panel of a paper fan. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS324
00:22:04,00 --> 00:22:11,50
With a thoughtful smile, SOMEONE<Lily> finishes writing and props her cheek on her hand. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS325
00:22:11,00 --> 00:22:18,50
Now, a group of women sit around a table decorating the edges of a red bridal bed blanket. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS326
00:22:16,00 --> 00:22:22,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE, who sits beside her sewing. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS328
00:22:24,00 --> 00:22:31,50
The privileged young woman gives her friend a sly smile and averts her gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS329
00:22:28,00 --> 00:22:33,50
Now alone together, they arrange a bouquet. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS332
00:22:37,00 --> 00:22:43,50
SOMEONE<Flower> stares at her worried friend, who clutches her hand. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS334
00:22:46,00 --> 00:22:50,50
She tries to stifle a chuckle. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS336
00:22:53,00 --> 00:22:59,50
SOMEONE<Lily> shoves her friend, then allows a smile. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS337
00:22:56,00 --> 00:23:07,50
Now, in the daytime, a procession of women with their faces hidden behind red scarves exit SOMEONE's<Lily's> home through a doorway adorned on each side with a red banner. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS338
00:23:09,00 --> 00:23:16,50
Behind them, SOMEONE holds SOMEONE's arm and guides her outside. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS339
00:23:13,00 --> 00:23:19,50
A red scarf hangs over SOMEONE's bridal crown, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS340
00:23:16,00 --> 00:23:20,50
veiling her face. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS343
00:23:21,00 --> 00:23:26,50
With SOMEONE at her side, the bride takes cautious steps over the threshold, then stops in front of her parents. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS348
00:23:38,00 --> 00:23:43,50
She eyes her daughter through the red veil. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS350
00:23:41,00 --> 00:23:48,50
She bows her head. SOMEONE<Flower> starts to guide the bride away, but SOMEONE<Lily> stops. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS351
00:23:46,00 --> 00:23:51,50
SOMEONE tugs on her arm, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS352
00:23:48,00 --> 00:23:53,50
but her laotong remains in place. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS353
00:23:50,00 --> 00:23:55,50
SOMEONE<Lily> turns back to her parents. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS357
00:24:03,00 --> 00:24:08,50
With SOMEONE tugging her arm, SOMEONE reluctantly moves on, but her face remains turned toward her cheerful mother. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS360
00:24:12,00 --> 00:24:18,50
The two friends walk past townsfolk gathered to watch the procession, then stop at a gateway in a brick wall that encloses the property. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS362
00:24:17,00 --> 00:24:22,50
Standing there, Madame SOMEONE gives SOMEONE an expectant look. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS364
00:24:22,00 --> 00:24:27,50
The young bride turns to her laotong, the beaded fringe on her veil swaying back and forth. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS366
00:24:27,00 --> 00:24:34,50
Reaching into the loose sleeve of her robe, SOMEONE withdraws a folded paper fan and holds it out to her friend. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS367
00:24:34,00 --> 00:24:40,50
SOMEONE<Lily> takes it, then lifts her gaze to her laotong's. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS368
00:24:37,00 --> 00:24:43,50
SOMEONE<Flower> helps her slide the fan down her own sleeve. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS369
00:24:41,00 --> 00:24:46,50
She rests her hand on the bride's. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS373
00:24:55,00 --> 00:25:00,50
SOMEONE<Lily> pushes aside her veil's fringe. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS375
00:25:00,00 --> 00:25:06,50
Her friend grabs her wrist and lowers her hand from the veil. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS376
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:10,50
Swallowing, SOMEONE gives her laotong a sad look. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS377
00:25:08,00 --> 00:25:14,50
Still clutching the bride's hands, she glances into the street, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS378
00:25:11,00 --> 00:25:17,50
where musicians play by a waiting sedan chair. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS379
00:25:14,00 --> 00:25:20,50
Smoke billows into the air as firecrackers pop. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS380
00:25:18,00 --> 00:25:23,50
Now, SOMEONE<Lily> sits at the edge of a curtained state bed, her hands folded in her lap. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS382
00:25:22,00 --> 00:25:29,50
A young man walks over and lifts off her veil, revealing her elaborate bridal crown. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS383
00:25:27,00 --> 00:25:32,50
A mountain of fruit rests on top, and a second veil of dangling beads offers a semi-obscured view of her nervous face. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS384
00:25:29,00 --> 00:25:37,50
As the groom sits beside his new bride, she scoots a few inches away from him. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS388
00:25:42,00 --> 00:25:47,50
He lowers his disappointed gaze, then shoots her a tentative glance. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS389
00:25:47,00 --> 00:25:52,50
He gently grabs the skirt of her robe 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS390
00:25:51,00 --> 00:25:56,50
closed together tightly. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS391
00:25:58,00 --> 00:26:06,50
SOMEONE<Lily> blinks behind the beaded fringe of her bridal crown as her husband kneels and lifts her tiny foot. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS392
00:26:07,00 --> 00:26:12,50
He lowers his face to her red lotus shoe. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS394
00:26:12,00 --> 00:26:17,50
Closing his eyes, he gently kisses and caresses her foot. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS395
00:26:20,00 --> 00:26:26,50
SOMEONE<Lily> tries to pull it away, but he holds tight. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS396
00:26:24,00 --> 00:26:28,50
He kisses her instep again. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS397
00:26:25,00 --> 00:26:31,50
SOMEONE<Lily> withdraws and he glances up at her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS398
00:26:34,00 --> 00:26:41,50
Sitting up next to his bride again, he tosses his braid over his shoulder and grabs her hand. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS399
00:26:40,00 --> 00:26:45,50
SOMEONE<Lily> tries to pull it away but he holds firm. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS400
00:26:43,00 --> 00:26:49,50
Avoiding his gaze, she stops struggling and blinks resignedly. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS401
00:26:56,00 --> 00:27:04,50
One year later. An elderly couple sits on either side of a table facing us. The man lights a pipe. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS404
00:27:07,00 --> 00:27:14,50
Standing in a hallway, a pregnant SOMEONE<Lily> eavesdrops on the conversation. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS410
00:27:30,00 --> 00:27:35,50
She exits the room and sees SOMEONE<Lily>. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS412
00:27:35,00 --> 00:27:40,50
She exits past her shy daughter-in-law. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS413
00:27:37,00 --> 00:27:44,50
Later, SOMEONE<Lily> folds a robe in her bedroom while her husband pours tea at a small table. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS418
00:28:02,00 --> 00:28:07,50
SOMEONE<Lily> shifts her concerned gaze away. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS420
00:28:10,00 --> 00:28:16,50
With his eyes averted from his wife, he takes a sip of tea. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS421
00:28:13,00 --> 00:28:19,50
He rests the cup just below his lips as he swallows, then turns to SOMEONE<Lily> with a furrowed brow and finds her gazing at him. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS423
00:28:20,00 --> 00:28:24,50
She lowers her solemn eyes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS425
00:28:23,00 --> 00:28:31,50
Now in the present. SOMEONE<Nina> shifts her handbag's shoulder strap as she climbs some steps leading to a set of glass doors. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS428
00:28:31,00 --> 00:28:38,50
IPushing one open, she enters an art gallery. n the foyer, a well-dressed man sits at a table covered in artwork. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS429
00:28:35,00 --> 00:28:39,50
He chats with another man. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS433
00:28:46,00 --> 00:28:57,50
With a nod, she heads back to an exhibit room where she finds a gallery worker hanging black and white images of disfigured feet on a crisp white wall. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS435
00:28:56,00 --> 00:29:02,50
Walking deeper into the room, SOMEONE<Nina> eyes a display podium holding pairs of tiny lotus shoes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS437
00:29:01,00 --> 00:29:08,50
On another wall, a drawing of a fan sits below writing in images detailing Chinese tradition. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS438
00:29:06,00 --> 00:29:13,50
SOMEONE<Nina> examines real paper fans sitting atop a row of display podiums. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS439
00:29:10,00 --> 00:29:16,50
She gazes at the writing on the spread panels of one. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS440
00:29:14,00 --> 00:29:18,50
A short-haired woman dressed in all black 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS441
00:29:16,00 --> 00:29:21,50
with a straight line of bangs over her eyebrows approaches. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS451
00:29:52,00 --> 00:29:57,50
SOMEONE<Nina> notices a projection on a wall. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS453
00:29:56,00 --> 00:30:02,50
Moving closer to the bright panel, she sees rows of Chinese characters. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS454
00:29:59,00 --> 00:30:05,50
As a gallery worker scrolls through text on a laptop, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS455
00:30:02,00 --> 00:30:07,50
the projected image moves as well. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS456
00:30:05,00 --> 00:30:10,50
This is a new interactive nu shu program. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS457
00:30:08,00 --> 00:30:14,50
As Claire scrolls downs the rows of characters on a second laptop, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS458
00:30:11,00 --> 00:30:16,50
SOMEONE<Nina> gazes at the projection. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS459
00:30:13,00 --> 00:30:19,50
The light casts a pale glow on her delicate face. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS460
00:30:16,00 --> 00:30:23,50
Now, SOMEONE<Lily> opens a jewelry box drawer and takes out a paper fan. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS461
00:30:21,00 --> 00:30:26,50
Later, she sits at a table and writes on it. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS462
00:30:23,00 --> 00:30:28,50
A baby rests beside her in a bassinet. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS466
00:30:37,00 --> 00:30:44,50
Spreading open the fan, SOMEONE reads her friend's message. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS469
00:30:50,00 --> 00:30:57,50
Now, SOMEONE's<Lily's> mother-in-law sits at the head of the table of a group of women doing embroidery work. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS474
00:31:06,00 --> 00:31:11,50
Her mother-in-law's eyes remain on her stitching. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS476
00:31:15,00 --> 00:31:21,50
SOMEONE<Lily> blinks, then averts her heartbroken gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS479
00:31:24,00 --> 00:31:31,50
She looks up at her mother-in-law, who turns to her with an unyielding expression. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS480
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:33,50
Setting down her embroidery hoop, the matronly woman lifts a lid off her teacup. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS482
00:31:32,00 --> 00:31:36,50
Steam wafts out. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS487
00:31:48,00 --> 00:31:55,50
Later, SOMEONE<Lily> paces with hobbled steps and wrings her hands as she waits in a dim hallway. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS488
00:31:53,00 --> 00:31:57,50
A servant girl rushes over. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS490
00:31:59,00 --> 00:32:04,50
SOMEONE<Lily> slides the folded fan out from her sleeve. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS492
00:32:06,00 --> 00:32:11,50
She places SOMEONE's hands around it. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS493
00:32:08,00 --> 00:32:12,50
The servant girl nods. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS494
00:32:09,00 --> 00:32:14,50
Clutching the fan to her chest, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS495
00:32:11,00 --> 00:32:17,50
she cautiously glances around, then hurries off down the hall. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS496
00:32:15,00 --> 00:32:20,50
SOMEONE watches her disappear down a staircase, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS497
00:32:17,00 --> 00:32:22,50
then turns her look. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS502
00:32:40,00 --> 00:32:50,50
Now, SOMEONE pushes open a gate's wooden doors. Hurrying to a sedan chair, she takes SOMEONE's<Lily's> arm as the woman exits the litter. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS503
00:32:48,00 --> 00:32:52,50
A porter tilts it forward, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS504
00:32:49,00 --> 00:32:55,50
allowing her to step over the wooden rails in front. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS505
00:32:52,00 --> 00:32:57,50
SOMEONE<Gang> accompanies her through the open gate. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS506
00:32:56,00 --> 00:33:03,50
SOMEONE<Lily> makes her way across a bridge outside a temple, then turns to the young servant. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS508
00:33:03,00 --> 00:33:08,50
As SOMEONE returns to the gate, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS509
00:33:05,00 --> 00:33:09,50
a woman approaches SOMEONE<Lily>. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS511
00:33:09,00 --> 00:33:15,50
SOMEONE<Lily> joyfully clasps her hands around her friend's. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS512
00:33:13,00 --> 00:33:20,50
Now, they each add a fresh stick of incense to a pot filled with the smoldering tokens. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS513
00:33:18,00 --> 00:33:25,50
The two friends kneel, press their hands together in prayer, and bow their heads. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS514
00:33:25,00 --> 00:33:30,50
Later, they sit on a bench. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS516
00:33:33,00 --> 00:33:38,50
Her head hung low, SOMEONE nods morosely. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS520
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:52,50
SOMEONE<Flower> glances at her troubled friend, then takes her hands and shifts her gaze straight ahead. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS521
00:33:50,00 --> 00:33:57,50
SOMEONE<Lily> lifts her eyes to her laotong's calm face and twitches a tender smile. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS525
00:34:04,00 --> 00:34:08,50
Now, a door closes SOMEONE<Lily> into a room. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS528
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:22,50
SOMEONE<Lily> sinks to her knees. With an anguished look, she peers through a crack, then slumps against the thick wooden door. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS529
00:34:24,00 --> 00:34:36,50
In the present, as SOMEONE<Nina> sits asleep with her head propped against a wall, a female hand reaches out and gently brushes her long bangs from her face then taps her shoulder. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS530
00:34:34,00 --> 00:34:39,50
SOMEONE<Nina> wakes and looks up at the visitor. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS531
00:34:39,00 --> 00:34:44,50
SOMEONE's<Sophia's> aunt sits beside her on a bench in the hallway. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS532
00:34:49,00 --> 00:34:53,50
She lets out a breath. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS533
00:34:51,00 --> 00:34:56,50
SOMEONE<Nina> glances at her ashamedly. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS534
00:35:02,00 --> 00:35:07,50
She watches sympathetically as SOMEONE<Nina> hangs her head. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS536
00:35:52,00 --> 00:35:58,50
SOMEONE<Nina> lowers her gaze and stares at the floor, lost in thought. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS537
00:35:56,00 --> 00:36:04,50
Our view gently drifts toward her worried face framed by thin strands of her raven hair. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS538
00:36:06,00 --> 00:36:12,50
Now, SOMEONE sits alone at a table. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS540
00:36:10,00 --> 00:36:16,50
She dips a brush in ink, then begins to write on a fan spread open before her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS543
00:36:23,00 --> 00:36:30,50
In another room, an old man lies on his side, smoking a long-stemmed pipe. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS546
00:36:33,00 --> 00:36:39,50
SOMEONE<Flower> spies on him from a cracked open door. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS547
00:36:36,00 --> 00:36:46,50
Our view drifts from the old man's pinched, intoxicated face to the pipe in his hand and a burning opium lamp nearby. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS548
00:36:43,00 --> 00:36:48,50
SOMEONE<Flower> shuts the door. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS549
00:36:45,00 --> 00:36:54,50
The image dissolves to SOMEONE<Lily> as she opens the fan to the many columns of Chinese lettering in its folds. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS552
00:36:57,00 --> 00:37:02,50
SOMEONE gazes thoughtfully at the message, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS553
00:36:59,00 --> 00:37:05,50
then shuts the fan and touches it to her chin. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS554
00:37:04,00 --> 00:37:09,50
She dreamily closes her eyes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS556
00:37:11,00 --> 00:37:15,50
As she gently presses the fan to her cheek, the image fades to black. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS557
00:37:16,00 --> 00:37:21,50
Now, two years later. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS558
00:37:18,00 --> 00:37:24,50
Our view drifts from an open burning stove to SOMEONE, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS559
00:37:21,00 --> 00:37:27,50
who stares off thoughtfully with an infant strapped to her back. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS560
00:37:27,00 --> 00:37:35,50
She lowers her disheartened gaze, then removes a closed fan from the sleeve of her blue robe. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS561
00:37:36,00 --> 00:37:41,50
She opens it and begins to read. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS565
00:37:54,00 --> 00:37:59,50
Now, SOMEONE<Lily> stands at a window. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS567
00:38:03,00 --> 00:38:10,50
She watches two men carry a body outside, then lowers her gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS568
00:38:07,00 --> 00:38:16,50
Beyond an empty dinner table, a hysterical woman walks past an open door with a baby in her arms. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS569
00:38:13,00 --> 00:38:19,50
Bringing a tea pot to the table, SOMEONE<Lily> watches her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS570
00:38:16,00 --> 00:38:24,50
Lady SOMEONE<Lu> staggers backward into view at the doorway as her daughter-in-law prepares the tea. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS578
00:38:41,00 --> 00:38:46,50
She follows after her mother-in-law. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS580
00:38:44,00 --> 00:38:51,50
Wearing white cloth over her nose and mouth, SOMEONE<Lily> tends to Lady SOMEONE<Lu>, who lies in bed. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS583
00:38:56,00 --> 00:39:03,50
As SOMEONE<Lily> feeds the sick woman, an old man peeks in through a door. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS584
00:39:00,00 --> 00:39:06,50
Upon seeing them, he covers his mouth and steps back out. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS585
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:12,50
Now, SOMEONE<Lily> carries a tray of food through a darkened hall. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS586
00:39:09,00 --> 00:39:15,50
She sets it down, then approaches a door and peeks inside. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS587
00:39:13,00 --> 00:39:18,50
A light from within the room shines on her face. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS597
00:39:41,00 --> 00:39:46,50
SOMEONE<Lily> covers her mouth in distress. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS598
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:51,50
Now, a view through a barred upper floor window shows a man lying dead in the street below. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS599
00:39:48,00 --> 00:39:55,50
SOMEONE<Lily> peers outside with the soft daylight shining on her face. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS600
00:39:57,00 --> 00:40:08,50
Now, a woman with a cloth over her nose and mouth uses a stick to pick up an article of clothing from a pile and drop it into a small fire burning in the middle of a patio. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS601
00:40:06,00 --> 00:40:12,50
SOMEONE<Lily> steps into view with her face covered as well. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS602
00:40:09,00 --> 00:40:14,50
She watches the incineration. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS603
00:40:13,00 --> 00:40:18,50
SOMEONE<Gang> runs in through a gate. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS605
00:40:17,00 --> 00:40:21,50
She bows respectfully. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS607
00:40:21,00 --> 00:40:26,50
SOMEONE<Lily> looks toward the gate. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS608
00:40:23,00 --> 00:40:29,50
Later, a couple bows ceremoniously to her and her husband, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS609
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:31,50
who now wears a mustache and smokes a pipe. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS610
00:40:30,00 --> 00:40:35,50
Master and Lady SOMEONE<Lu> passed away. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS611
00:40:33,00 --> 00:40:37,50
They both succumbed to the plague. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS612
00:40:35,00 --> 00:40:41,50
On this day of the new year, we became Master and Lady SOMEONE<Lu>. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS613
00:40:39,00 --> 00:40:44,50
A second couple bows to them and walks off. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS614
00:40:42,00 --> 00:40:52,50
The center portion of her lips painted red, SOMEONE<Lily> wears an elegant black silk robe with a royal blue yoke and elaborate silver jewelry. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS615
00:40:50,00 --> 00:40:57,50
She maintains an emotionless expression as the villagers continue to pay their respects. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS617
00:40:56,00 --> 00:41:01,50
In present day, the identically featured SOMEONE<Nina> drives her car through the city. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS618
00:41:01,00 --> 00:41:06,50
She peers out the passenger window. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS619
00:41:03,00 --> 00:41:10,50
Passing some scaffolding and a few partly torn down buildings, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS620
00:41:07,00 --> 00:41:14,50
she spots a few distant skyscrapers and a tall crane beyond the rundown neighborhood. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS621
00:41:14,00 --> 00:41:21,50
A lone three-story house stands in the middle of a construction site. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS623
00:41:22,00 --> 00:41:28,50
Now inside, SOMEONE<Lily> cautiously approaches a door with her purse in hand. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS624
00:41:26,00 --> 00:41:29,50
She knocks. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS625
00:41:32,00 --> 00:41:37,50
She turns for the exit. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS626
00:41:36,00 --> 00:41:41,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Liao> opens the door, fixing her hair. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS627
00:41:39,00 --> 00:41:44,50
Noticing SOMEONE<Nina>, she straightens her bath robe. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS660
00:43:08,00 --> 00:43:14,50
In flashback, SOMEONE<Nina> and SOMEONE<Sophia> watch a news report. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS661
00:43:12,00 --> 00:43:19,50
Today, the stock market hit a new low due to the liquidation of Peregrine Investments. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS662
00:43:17,00 --> 00:43:22,50
In the living room, Mr. SOMEONE<Liao> paces. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS664
00:43:24,00 --> 00:43:28,50
SOMEONE<Nina> peers into the room. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS666
00:43:30,00 --> 00:43:34,50
SOMEONE<Sophia> shakes her head. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS671
00:43:53,00 --> 00:43:58,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Liao> shifts his trouble gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS672
00:43:55,00 --> 00:44:02,50
He turns and ambles across the room to a window, posts his arm on the wall, and hangs his head. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS673
00:44:02,00 --> 00:44:07,50
SOMEONE<Sophia> opens a door and peeks into the room. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS674
00:44:06,00 --> 00:44:12,50
Glancing around, she spots her father by the window. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS675
00:44:11,00 --> 00:44:19,50
She crosses to him, shuffling past a mantle adorned with framed pictures and an ornamental clock. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS676
00:44:23,00 --> 00:44:27,50
He wipes his face. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS677
00:44:24,00 --> 00:44:29,50
SOMEONE<Sophia> takes a step closer. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS678
00:44:28,00 --> 00:44:32,50
The market goes up and down. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS680
00:44:32,00 --> 00:44:36,50
She holds her father's hands. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS683
00:44:40,00 --> 00:44:45,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Liao> nods and they hug. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS684
00:44:43,00 --> 00:44:48,50
Resting her chin on his shoulder, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS685
00:44:45,00 --> 00:44:51,50
SOMEONE<Sophia> holds her father tight and gazes off thoughtfully. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS686
00:44:51,00 --> 00:44:56,50
Now holding three incense sticks, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS687
00:44:53,00 --> 00:45:04,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Liao> bows repeatedly before a small altar with a framed photograph of Mr. SOMEONE<Liao> surrounded by candles, flowers, and bowls of fruit and rice. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS688
00:45:03,00 --> 00:45:08,50
She sets the incense sticks in a dish. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS689
00:45:10,00 --> 00:45:16,50
Among other mourners, the aunt steps past her and nods. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS690
00:45:14,00 --> 00:45:21,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Liao> follows her with her eyes as she sits beside SOMEONE<Sophia> and rubs her back. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS691
00:45:18,00 --> 00:45:24,50
The bereaved daughter rests her head on SOMEONE's<Nina's> shoulder. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS692
00:45:22,00 --> 00:45:28,50
A male mourner walks across our view of the best friends. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS696
00:45:37,00 --> 00:45:41,50
She wipes her nose. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS697
00:45:41,00 --> 00:45:45,50
And to do this in his own home. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS698
00:45:43,00 --> 00:45:49,50
She shakes her head, then looks at SOMEONE<Sophia> and SOMEONE<Nina>. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS699
00:45:47,00 --> 00:45:51,50
His daughter won't speak to me. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS700
00:45:51,00 --> 00:45:56,50
She isn't even studying for the college entrance exam. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS702
00:45:59,00 --> 00:46:04,50
The teary-eyed girl shifts in her seat. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS703
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:05,50
Now at night. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS704
00:46:02,00 --> 00:46:08,50
SOMEONE<Nina> consoles her friend, who wipes her eyes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS705
00:46:05,00 --> 00:46:09,50
SOMEONE<Sophia> cries on her shoulder. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS706
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:18,50
SOMEONE's<Nina's> eyes glisten with tears and she lowers her saddened gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS707
00:46:17,00 --> 00:46:23,50
Later, she sleeps in SOMEONE's<Sophia's> bed with her arm draped over her friend. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS708
00:46:22,00 --> 00:46:29,50
Now at school, they cross the hallway with other students. SOMEONE<Sophia> grabs her friend's arm. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS709
00:46:41,00 --> 00:46:46,50
SOMEONE<Nina> watches her hurry down the hall. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS711
00:46:49,00 --> 00:46:56,50
Later, in a classroom, SOMEONE<Nina> sits amongst other students taking the test at their desks. Behind her, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS712
00:46:53,00 --> 00:46:58,50
a teacher paces an aisle. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS713
00:46:55,00 --> 00:47:02,50
SOMEONE folds back the sleeve of her flannel shirt and checks her watch, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS714
00:46:59,00 --> 00:47:03,50
then peers across the room. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS715
00:47:01,00 --> 00:47:07,50
Returning her attention to the test, she chews on the pen. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS716
00:47:07,00 --> 00:47:12,50
A heading reads "Listening Comprehension". 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS717
00:47:10,00 --> 00:47:14,50
SOMEONE<Nina> begins to write. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS720
00:47:22,00 --> 00:47:27,50
SOMEONE<Nina> shifts in her seat again and resumes her work. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS721
00:47:25,00 --> 00:47:31,50
At night, a band performs under a low arched ceiling. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS722
00:47:31,00 --> 00:47:39,50
SOMEONE<Sophia> and SOMEONE<Nina> make their way through a tightly packed crowd of fans waving their arms overhead. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS723
00:47:42,00 --> 00:47:49,50
They duck under a low archway to a side room with a tiled wall. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS724
00:48:03,00 --> 00:48:09,50
She hugs SOMEONE<Sophia>, who looks past her with a worried expression. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS725
00:48:07,00 --> 00:48:11,50
SOMEONE<Nina> steps back in front of her friend. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS726
00:48:17,00 --> 00:48:24,50
She leads her taller friend back through the frenzied crowd toward the stage. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS727
00:48:21,00 --> 00:48:28,50
Flood lights on the arched cement walls give the tunnel-like performance space a blue tint. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS728
00:48:26,00 --> 00:48:31,50
Now, in her kitchen, Mrs. Wei chops vegetables. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS731
00:48:35,00 --> 00:48:41,50
She sets down her knife, wipes her hands, then answers the door. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS734
00:48:43,00 --> 00:48:49,50
The bespectacled man produces and envelope and hands it to her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS735
00:48:49,00 --> 00:48:55,50
Mrs. Wei opens it, then removes and unfolds a letter. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS736
00:48:54,00 --> 00:49:01,50
She reads. Shanghai Education Board. Disciplinary Notice. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS737
00:49:00,00 --> 00:49:05,50
Later, she faces her pigtailed daughter. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS740
00:49:13,00 --> 00:49:16,50
SOMEONE<Nina> walks out. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS751
00:49:44,00 --> 00:49:48,50
SOMEONE<Nina> hangs her head. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS753
00:49:49,00 --> 00:49:56,50
Mrs. Wei storms off, leaving her daughter standing alone on the balcony with her head down. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS754
00:49:55,00 --> 00:50:00,50
Now, a commercial jet taxis to a gate. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS756
00:49:59,00 --> 00:50:05,50
Elsewhere at the airport, the two friends face each by a window, sharing a long gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS757
00:50:03,00 --> 00:50:07,50
SOMEONE<Nina> forces a smile. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS758
00:50:04,00 --> 00:50:13,50
SOMEONE<Sophia> turns and wheels her suitcase through a set of automatic doors underneath the sign for Terminal 1. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS759
00:50:10,00 --> 00:50:16,50
SOMEONE<Nina> takes a couple of steps to the side, watching her friend go. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS760
00:50:14,00 --> 00:50:19,50
The automatic doors slide shut behind SOMEONE<Sophia>. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS761
00:50:17,00 --> 00:50:22,50
SOMEONE<Nina> turns away and ambles off alone. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS762
00:50:55,00 --> 00:51:03,50
Now, our view rises from a customer's menu to find SOMEONE<Nina> working as a waitress in a pink uniform. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS764
00:51:02,00 --> 00:51:09,50
In the restaurant's kitchen, our view descends from a metal counter to find SOMEONE<Nina> studying while on break. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS766
00:51:09,00 --> 00:51:14,50
She brushes a strand of hair behind her ear, then jots a note on a pad over a textbook. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS767
00:51:13,00 --> 00:51:20,50
Now, SOMEONE<Nina> crosses a courtyard to a wooden mailbox on a wall. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS768
00:51:17,00 --> 00:51:24,50
She produces a key, unlocks a padlock, and opens the box to find an envelope inside. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS769
00:51:23,00 --> 00:51:28,50
Brightening, she takes it out and studies it. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS771
00:51:30,00 --> 00:51:37,50
Now dressed for an interview, SOMEONE<Nina> stands up as Sebastian walks another female applicant out of his office. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS772
00:51:43,00 --> 00:51:49,50
At night, SOMEONE<Nina> sits at a cubicle in the darkened office. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS773
00:51:58,00 --> 00:52:06,50
She sets a few file aside, picks up a document, then leans back in her chair and reads. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS776
00:52:07,00 --> 00:52:13,50
In the present, SOMEONE<Nina> sits at SOMEONE's<Sophia's> bedside reading the manuscript. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS778
00:52:13,00 --> 00:52:19,50
Finishing a page, she sets it down by her lap among several others. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS779
00:52:18,00 --> 00:52:24,50
Later, SOMEONE<Nina> crosses to a window overlooking the city. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS780
00:52:22,00 --> 00:52:27,50
She rests her hand on the sill and peers outside. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS781
00:52:25,00 --> 00:52:29,50
On the busy street below, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS782
00:52:27,00 --> 00:52:33,50
four men carry a red palanquin litter along the sidewalk. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS783
00:52:32,00 --> 00:52:36,50
SOMEONE<Nina> shifts her thoughtful gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS784
00:52:36,00 --> 00:52:42,50
The image dissolves to a  river, beyond which stands a high cliff. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS785
00:52:40,00 --> 00:52:45,50
A palanquin gets carried across the far bank. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS786
00:52:43,00 --> 00:52:48,50
SOMEONE<Lily> rides inside peering out a window. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS790
00:53:04,00 --> 00:53:09,50
Now, SOMEONE opens a wooden gate. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS791
00:53:06,00 --> 00:53:11,50
She sighs excitedly, expelling a foggy breath. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS795
00:53:18,00 --> 00:53:24,50
SOMEONE<Lily> takes her friend's hands and presses them against her heart. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS796
00:53:21,00 --> 00:53:26,50
Behind them, villagers look on. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS799
00:53:26,00 --> 00:53:30,50
SOMEONE<Lily> nods. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS800
00:53:27,00 --> 00:53:33,50
SOMEONE<Flower> leads her by the hand into a courtyard. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS801
00:53:30,00 --> 00:53:36,50
SOMEONE<Lily> observes her shabby surroundings and deflates. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS802
00:53:33,00 --> 00:53:39,50
The friends pass a single cow standing off to the side. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS803
00:53:37,00 --> 00:53:41,50
A rooster meanders. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS804
00:53:38,00 --> 00:53:46,50
Beyond a steaming wok over a fire pit, slaughtered animal carcasses hang from hooks. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS805
00:53:44,00 --> 00:53:48,50
SOMEONE<Lily> faces SOMEONE<Snow>. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS807
00:53:48,00 --> 00:53:52,50
SOMEONE<Flower> nods. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS810
00:53:59,00 --> 00:54:04,50
SOMEONE<Lily> looks sadly at her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS813
00:54:06,00 --> 00:54:12,50
SOMEONE<Lily> glances down, then looks hesitantly at SOMEONE<Snow>. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS817
00:54:22,00 --> 00:54:28,50
the two friends sit at a table working with vegetables. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS818
00:54:26,00 --> 00:54:34,50
Across the hay-strewn courtyard, SOMEONE's husband corrals a pig with a stick. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS819
00:54:31,00 --> 00:54:36,50
He kicks the animal's rear and locks it in a pen. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS820
00:54:34,00 --> 00:54:38,50
SOMEONE<Lily> watches him. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS821
00:54:37,00 --> 00:54:43,50
The burly man carries a leafy vegetable across the yard. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS822
00:54:41,00 --> 00:54:47,50
He tosses it onto the woman's table then marches off. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS823
00:54:48,00 --> 00:54:54,50
Now at a dinner table, SOMEONE feeds one of her daughters. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS824
00:54:52,00 --> 00:54:56,50
SOMEONE<Lily> sits at her other side. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS825
00:54:54,00 --> 00:55:00,50
The butcher glowers over his bowl as he shovels food into his mouth. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS826
00:54:58,00 --> 00:55:03,50
SOMEONE<Flower> musters a smile for her laotong. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS827
00:55:01,00 --> 00:55:08,50
Across the table, her husband shakes sauce off a round dumpling and bites into it. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS828
00:55:05,00 --> 00:55:11,50
SOMEONE<Lily> lowers her disapproving gaze to her bowl. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS829
00:55:08,00 --> 00:55:13,50
The butcher slurps down his tea in one gulp. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS831
00:55:14,00 --> 00:55:19,50
As he leaves the table, SOMEONE gets up and follows him to a doorway. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS834
00:55:25,00 --> 00:55:30,50
He looks past his wife to SOMEONE, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS835
00:55:27,00 --> 00:55:32,50
who lowers her unhappy gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS837
00:55:30,00 --> 00:55:35,50
Later, in the dark, the well-to-do guest lies in a humble bed, her eyes open. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS839
00:55:35,00 --> 00:55:41,50
SOMEONE<Lily> hesitantly rolls over and leans her head over the edge of the bed. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS840
00:55:39,00 --> 00:55:45,50
Light filtering between the floor boards glows on her delicate features. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS841
00:55:43,00 --> 00:55:48,50
She leans a little further to see below. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS842
00:55:45,00 --> 00:55:53,50
In the room beneath her, the shirtless butcher lies on top of SOMEONE and thrusts. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS844
00:55:52,00 --> 00:55:57,50
She clings to him tightly, her eyes closed and her lips parted. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS845
00:55:54,00 --> 00:55:58,50
SOMEONE<Lily> watches them. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS846
00:56:03,00 --> 00:56:09,50
SOMEONE's<Flower's> hand gently caresses her husband's back. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS847
00:56:07,00 --> 00:56:13,50
SOMEONE<Lily> returns to her shadowy bed and rolls over to face the ceiling. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS848
00:56:12,00 --> 00:56:18,50
Her eyes close and her chest heaves beneath the thick blanket. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS849
00:56:19,00 --> 00:56:25,50
SOMEONE lets her hand drift up to her own face, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS851
00:56:33,00 --> 00:56:38,50
Her fingertips awkwardly touching her skin, As they trail down her bare throat, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS853
00:56:40,00 --> 00:56:45,50
Her other arm crosses her chest, she gathers the blanket up close to her chin. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS855
00:56:45,00 --> 00:56:52,50
In the present day, SOMEONE's<Nina's> feet slip off a pair of black high-heeled shoes and rest on a white carpet. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS856
00:56:49,00 --> 00:56:54,50
One bare foot rubs the other ankle. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS857
00:56:52,00 --> 00:56:57,50
SOMEONE's<Nina's> hand reaches down and massages one foot. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS858
00:56:55,00 --> 00:57:00,50
She lifts it up across her knee 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS859
00:56:57,00 --> 00:57:02,50
and gently caresses the backs of her toes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS860
00:57:00,00 --> 00:57:06,50
Her soft downturned gaze remains fixed on the moment of self-care. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS863
00:57:15,00 --> 00:57:23,50
Her gaze growing distant.  

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS864
00:57:20,00 --> 00:57:25,50
In the butcher's house, her 19th century counterpart sleeps curled up in the humble bed. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS865
00:57:23,00 --> 00:57:29,50
She stirs awake and looks around.  

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS866
00:57:26,00 --> 00:57:33,50
The noblewoman sits up, her long hair loose around her shoulder. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS867
00:57:31,00 --> 00:57:38,50
She peers down toward the lower floor, then shifts her puzzled gaze and gets up. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS868
00:57:36,00 --> 00:57:42,50
Smoke, wind, and sunlight stream in from a round hole in the wall serving as a window. SOMEONE<Lily> approaches it, raising a hand over her nose and mouth as she peers out. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS869
00:57:44,00 --> 00:57:48,50
The Taiping rebels are coming. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS870
00:57:46,00 --> 00:57:52,50
A little later, she goes downstairs disheveled and confused. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS877
00:57:59,00 --> 00:58:03,50
He rushes off. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS879
00:58:01,00 --> 00:58:07,50
The butcher drags an old woman from another room. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS880
00:58:04,00 --> 00:58:08,50
SOMEONE<Lily> grabs her friend. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS888
00:58:17,00 --> 00:58:22,50
The butcher steps close. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS889
00:58:19,00 --> 00:58:23,50
He picks SOMEONE<Lily> up. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS891
00:58:23,00 --> 00:58:28,50
He carries the resistant noblewoman out. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS892
00:58:25,00 --> 00:58:33,50
Later, the butcher leads an ox-drawn cart down a narrow road packed with fleeing refugees. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS893
00:58:30,00 --> 00:58:35,50
The cart carries his family and many belongings. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS897
00:58:43,00 --> 00:58:49,50
SOMEONE<Lily> helps him gather bulging sacks. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS899
00:58:49,00 --> 00:58:57,50
A sack in each powerful arm, the butcher leads his family farther on as panicking villagers race past. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS900
00:58:55,00 --> 00:59:01,50
Now, he and a couple of small boys arrive at a refugee campsite. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS901
00:58:58,00 --> 00:59:03,50
Behind him, SOMEONE and SOMEONE aid his mother. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS904
00:59:06,00 --> 00:59:12,50
The butcher hurries back to them, takes sacks from the old woman's back, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS905
00:59:09,00 --> 00:59:13,50
and leans them against a rock. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS906
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:15,50
The younger women lead her over. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS907
00:59:14,00 --> 00:59:18,50
Lay her down here. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS908
00:59:16,00 --> 00:59:22,50
They rest the old woman on a mound of filled sacks. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS909
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:25,50
SOMEONE<Lily> lifts her up as the butcher stuffs another sack beneath her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS910
00:59:22,00 --> 00:59:30,50
He briskly caresses his mother's face, then aces SOMEONE with a grave expression. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS915
00:59:36,00 --> 00:59:40,50
The butcher picks up a boy. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS916
00:59:38,00 --> 00:59:42,50
He SOMEONE<will> take care of your mama. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS917
00:59:40,00 --> 00:59:44,50
The little boy nods. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS918
00:59:41,00 --> 00:59:47,50
The butcher gives him a hearty kiss, sets him down, and strides off. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS919
00:59:45,00 --> 00:59:50,50
SOMEONE<Flower> and SOMEONE<Lily> gaze after him. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS920
00:59:47,00 --> 00:59:52,50
At night, SOMEONE faces her laotong. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS923
00:59:55,00 --> 01:00:01,50
The noblewoman bends down and removes her ornate slipper, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS924
00:59:58,00 --> 01:00:04,50
revealing her tiny bound foot still wrapped in bandages. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS925
01:00:02,00 --> 01:00:07,50
She massages her big toe and winces. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS926
01:00:04,00 --> 01:00:09,50
As she sits up, SOMEONE strokes her hair. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS929
01:00:18,00 --> 01:00:22,50
SOMEONE<Flower> strokes her friend's shoulder. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS930
01:00:21,00 --> 01:00:27,50
Now, the refugee women sit huddled around a campfire. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS932
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:36,50
Seated close to each other, SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare into the flames with listless expressions. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS933
01:00:33,00 --> 01:00:37,50
They barely sing. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS934
01:00:39,00 --> 01:00:44,50
A couple of small white flakes drift down from above. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS935
01:00:42,00 --> 01:00:47,50
A few more dart past, carried by the wind. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS936
01:00:45,00 --> 01:00:50,50
The two friends stop singing and peer up. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS937
01:00:48,00 --> 01:00:55,50
They share a grave look, then lean over and adjust the blankets covering the children at their feet. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS938
01:01:00,00 --> 01:01:08,50
SOMEONE<Flower> observes SOMEONE's<Lily's> attention to her sons and rubs her shoulder appreciatively. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS939
01:01:05,00 --> 01:01:12,50
The two women share a tender look and SOMEONE takes her hand. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS941
01:01:11,00 --> 01:01:16,50
At dawn, the snow falls heavily on the camp. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS942
01:01:14,00 --> 01:01:22,50
SOMEONE<Sno>, SOMEONE<Flower>, and her children lie huddled together under heavy blankets near the mouth of a cave. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS943
01:01:19,00 --> 01:01:25,50
The butcher returns and tethers the cow to a tree. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS945
01:01:24,00 --> 01:01:30,50
He finds his young son on the end without his share of the covers. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS946
01:01:28,00 --> 01:01:35,50
The father dusts snow off the child's clothes and adjusts the blanket to cover him. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS947
01:01:32,00 --> 01:01:37,50
Patting the boy's hand, he pauses. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS948
01:01:34,00 --> 01:01:41,50
The father lays a hand on his son's head, then touches his face. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS949
01:01:38,00 --> 01:01:43,50
The child lies unresponsive. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS950
01:01:40,00 --> 01:01:47,50
The butcher lowers the blanket and cranes his face close to the boy's. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS951
01:01:44,00 --> 01:01:49,50
The father sits back on his knees. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS952
01:01:46,00 --> 01:01:53,50
He hefts the boy's limp body and rocks him in his arms. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS954
01:01:51,00 --> 01:01:58,50
As he gets to his feet, his son's head rolls back limply and one arm dangles from his grasp. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS955
01:01:55,00 --> 01:02:01,50
The butcher clasps his son tightly to his chest. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS956
01:02:01,00 --> 01:02:06,50
He looks down at his lost child. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS957
01:02:07,00 --> 01:02:13,50
Staggering slightly, he plods away from the others. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS958
01:02:13,00 --> 01:02:19,50
Behind him, SOMEONE wakes to see her husband grimacing skyward. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS959
01:02:22,00 --> 01:02:26,50
She rushes over. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS961
01:02:26,00 --> 01:02:31,50
She cradles the boy's lifeless face. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS962
01:02:28,00 --> 01:02:35,50
The butcher shoves her away, then grabs her by the tunic and flings her aside. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS964
01:02:39,00 --> 01:02:45,50
SOMEONE<Flower> runs after her husband. SOMEONE<Lily> follows. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS965
01:02:47,00 --> 01:02:52,50
Now awake, the rest of the family watches gravely. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS966
01:02:55,00 --> 01:03:01,50
Now, the two laotongs sit face to face in the cave mouth. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS967
01:02:59,00 --> 01:03:05,50
SOMEONE dabs gently at SOMEONE's bruised, swollen eye. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS969
01:03:05,00 --> 01:03:11,50
Beyond them, snow continues to fall on the wooded campsite. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS971
01:03:09,00 --> 01:03:15,50
SOMEONE<Lily> pauses, her fingertips trailing down her friend's soft, round cheek. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS972
01:03:15,00 --> 01:03:22,50
She tenderly brushes wisps of loose hair out of SOMEONE's face, then lowers her hand. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS973
01:03:20,00 --> 01:03:25,50
She regards her friend compassionately, her eyes glistening. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS975
01:03:27,00 --> 01:03:33,50
SOMEONE's<Flower's> eyes well up as she and her sister regard each other. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS976
01:03:34,00 --> 01:03:39,50
A tear trails down SOMEONE's cheek. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS977
01:03:40,00 --> 01:03:47,50
SOMEONE<Lily> swallows, tilts her head, and presses her brow to her sister's. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS978
01:03:45,00 --> 01:03:53,50
SOMEONE<Flower> closes her eyes and brushes her cheek against her laotong's smooth skin. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS980
01:03:56,00 --> 01:04:01,50
She bows her head, her soft features pinching in a grief-stricken frown. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS981
01:04:03,00 --> 01:04:09,50
SOMEONE reaches out, cradles her face in her hand, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS982
01:04:06,00 --> 01:04:10,50
and gently lifts her head. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS984
01:04:15,00 --> 01:04:19,50
SOMEONE<Flower> absently meets her laotong's loving gaze, then leans back. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS985
01:04:16,00 --> 01:04:21,50
Her melancholy face falling out of view. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS986
01:04:21,00 --> 01:04:25,50
SOMEONE<Lily> looks on mournfully. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS987
01:04:27,00 --> 01:04:33,50
In the present, SOMEONE lies draped over SOMEONE's hospital bed, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS988
01:04:30,00 --> 01:04:36,50
sleeping with her hand over some of the manuscript pages. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS989
01:04:34,00 --> 01:04:41,50
Daylight from the windows accentuates her pale complexion as she slumbers. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS990
01:04:38,00 --> 01:04:45,50
A few stray wisps of her black hair obscure her delicate face, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS991
01:04:42,00 --> 01:04:47,50
which rests on her own outstretched arm. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS992
01:04:44,00 --> 01:04:50,50
Her jackets hangs slung over her chair's backrest 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS993
01:04:47,00 --> 01:04:53,50
and her right hand clutches a few more pages. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS994
01:04:50,00 --> 01:04:56,50
The rest of the stack lies on SOMEONE's<Sophia's> blanketed lap. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS995
01:04:56,00 --> 01:05:00,50
SOMEONE slumbers on. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS997
01:04:59,00 --> 01:05:04,50
Nearby, a monitor tracks her friend's vitals. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS998
01:05:16,00 --> 01:05:20,50
At night, in SOMEONE's<Nina's> car. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS999
01:05:18,00 --> 01:05:25,50
Staring off, she shifts her attention to the traffic ahead and pulls her car forward. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1000
01:05:23,00 --> 01:05:29,50
Now, we gaze at a Shanghai freeway from a distance. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1001
01:05:26,00 --> 01:05:33,50
The tightly-packed headlights shine brightly beneath the night sky. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1002
01:05:30,00 --> 01:05:37,50
Beyond them, a vast mass of skyscrapers stands mostly darkened. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1003
01:05:35,00 --> 01:05:38,50
Now, in a club. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1004
01:05:36,00 --> 01:05:44,50
A girlish singer in a slinky black dress leaves the stage and flirts with patrons on the dance floor. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1005
01:05:41,00 --> 01:05:50,50
On the periphery, a ruggedly handsome man of Anglo descent sports close cropped hair and a nice suit. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1006
01:05:47,00 --> 01:05:55,50
He finds SOMEONE<Nina> on a love seat where a man with a grey beard awkwardly fails to chat with her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1007
01:05:53,00 --> 01:05:59,50
A gold-framed oil portrait hangs upside down behind them. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1008
01:05:56,00 --> 01:06:00,50
The handsome man sits. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1009
01:05:59,00 --> 01:06:05,50
The grey-bearded playboy gives a disappointed shake of the head and leaves. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1010
01:06:03,00 --> 01:06:08,50
The handsome man offers SOMEONE<Nina> a brief sad smile. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1011
01:06:10,00 --> 01:06:15,50
She lowers her mirthless gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1012
01:06:12,00 --> 01:06:16,50
SOMEONE<Arthur> leans forward, his demeanor stoic and polite. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1014
01:06:17,00 --> 01:06:23,50
She hesitantly meets his tender brown-eyed gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1015
01:06:23,00 --> 01:06:28,50
She looks away remorsefully. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1016
01:06:25,00 --> 01:06:31,50
Now, traffic passes outside Hongking hospital. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1017
01:06:29,00 --> 01:06:34,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Arthur> smirks uneasily. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1018
01:06:31,00 --> 01:06:36,50
SOMEONE<Nina> stands close by in the corridor. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1019
01:06:35,00 --> 01:06:39,50
She takes a deep breath. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1020
01:06:39,00 --> 01:06:45,50
SOMEONE<Nina> studies his expression, then bows her head demurely. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1021
01:06:43,00 --> 01:06:49,50
SOMEONE<Arthur> crosses to SOMEONE's<Sophia's> door, opens it, and passes through. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1022
01:06:47,00 --> 01:06:52,50
SOMEONE<Nina> paces in the hall, then peers after him. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1024
01:06:51,00 --> 01:06:57,50
The well-dressed man shuffles to the bed and sinks down on its edge. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1025
01:06:55,00 --> 01:07:00,50
His hands rest on his knees as he slouches, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1026
01:06:57,00 --> 01:07:02,50
looking down at the comatose woman. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1027
01:07:01,00 --> 01:07:07,50
SOMEONE<Arthur> reaches an arm across her legs and rests his hand on the other side. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1029
01:07:06,00 --> 01:07:12,50
SOMEONE<Nina> turns away, putting her back to the corridor wall, and blinks heavily. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1030
01:07:11,00 --> 01:07:17,50
Now, SOMEONE<Nina> and SOMEONE<Sophia> sit side by side munching corn on the cob. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1031
01:07:15,00 --> 01:07:20,50
They watch TV and read magazines. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1032
01:07:17,00 --> 01:07:22,50
Words appear. Six months earlier. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1038
01:07:34,00 --> 01:07:40,50
SOMEONE<Sophia> reaches for her friend's chest and tickles her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1039
01:07:37,00 --> 01:07:43,50
SOMEONE<Nina> wrenches away, then playfully smacks SOMEONE's<Sophia's> head. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1040
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:49,50
Now in business attire, SOMEONE<Nina> works at a desktop computer. Sebastian strolls in with a smile. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1041
01:08:02,00 --> 01:08:07,50
SOMEONE<Nina> lowers an amazed grin. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1042
01:08:07,00 --> 01:08:17,50
Now at a bar lit dramatically by lemony yellow light bulbs, SOMEONE<Nina> takes two shots onto the near empty dance floor and hands one to SOMEONE<Sophia>. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1043
01:08:15,00 --> 01:08:22,50
In slinky party dresses, they SOMEONE<bob> to the music and swivel their hips as they drink. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1044
01:08:20,00 --> 01:08:28,50
SOMEONE<Sophia> flips her long hair and sidles closer to her laotong, her eyes closed in sensual pout. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1045
01:08:27,00 --> 01:08:32,50
SOMEONE<Nina> tosses her hair over her shoulders and tilts her head back. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1046
01:08:30,00 --> 01:08:35,50
Later, they sip their shots. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1047
01:08:32,00 --> 01:08:40,50
Now, in a back room, SOMEONE<Sophia> sits back in a plush chair and kicks off her high heels. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1049
01:08:38,00 --> 01:08:45,50
As she settles in, SOMEONE<Nina> saunters over with a liquor bottle in one hand, a drink in the other. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1050
01:08:42,00 --> 01:08:48,50
She sets the bottle down and sits next to her best friend. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1051
01:08:50,00 --> 01:08:55,50
SOMEONE<Sophia> regards her with a smile. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1052
01:09:05,00 --> 01:09:10,50
They clink glasses and sip the clear iceless drinks. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1053
01:09:58,00 --> 01:10:04,50
SOMEONE<Nina> gently pushes her friend's head away. SOMEONE<Sophia> glares. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1054
01:10:01,00 --> 01:10:08,50
Now at a fancy dinner club, SOMEONE<Arthur> stands in the spotlight before a band. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1055
01:10:26,00 --> 01:10:32,50
Sharing a table, Sebastian and SOMEONE<Nina> applaud. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1056
01:10:43,00 --> 01:10:47,50
Dancing couples take to the floor. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1057
01:10:53,00 --> 01:11:01,50
As an amused SOMEONE<Nina> and Sebastian watch from their distant table, SOMEONE<Arthur> crosses the dance floor. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1058
01:11:12,00 --> 01:11:18,50
SOMEONE<Arthur> arrives at a table and points at its occupant. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1059
01:11:15,00 --> 01:11:22,50
Sinking down to a chair, he sits close to SOMEONE<Sophia> and sings to her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1060
01:11:19,00 --> 01:11:24,50
She adopts a sullen pout, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1061
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:27,50
then brushes her hair back and faces him with a coy hint of a smile. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1062
01:11:25,00 --> 01:11:31,50
At their table, Sebastian claps good-humoredly. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1063
01:11:28,00 --> 01:11:33,50
A stunned SOMEONE<Nina> looks on uneasily. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1064
01:11:34,00 --> 01:11:38,50
SOMEONE<Sophia> chuckles. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1065
01:11:51,00 --> 01:11:56,50
As SOMEONE<Arthur> leans in, SOMEONE<Sophia> turns away. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1066
01:11:54,00 --> 01:12:02,50
She raises her fingers to her lips, shifts her coquettish gaze, and grants him a chaste kiss. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1067
01:12:04,00 --> 01:12:12,50
SOMEONE<Arthur> sets down his mic, takes SOMEONE's<Sophia's> hand, and leads her to the dance floor where he yanks her in close. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1068
01:12:09,00 --> 01:12:18,50
As SOMEONE<Nina> stares tensely, SOMEONE<Sophia> seizes the club owner's head and pulls him into a long, sensual kiss. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1069
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:24,50
SOMEONE<Arthur> gives a showman's smile, extends his arm in a mock shrug, and melts into the embrace. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1070
01:12:21,00 --> 01:12:29,50
His hand drifts to her waist, then slips down her slinky dark pink dress. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1071
01:12:26,00 --> 01:12:31,50
He caresses her shapely bottom. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1072
01:12:28,00 --> 01:12:33,50
SOMEONE<Nina> takes a strained breath and bows her head. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1073
01:12:31,00 --> 01:12:37,50
Later, SOMEONE<Sophia> saunters down a softly-lit hallway. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1074
01:12:34,00 --> 01:12:38,50
SOMEONE<Nina> follows her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1075
01:12:40,00 --> 01:12:48,50
Now facing a mirror, SOMEONE<Sophia> dabs tinted gloss on her full lips, then smiles at herself. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1076
01:12:45,00 --> 01:12:51,50
She leaves the restroom to find SOMEONE<Nina> waiting outside. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1077
01:13:43,00 --> 01:13:48,50
SOMEONE<Nina> stares at her with disbelief, then shakes her head. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1078
01:13:51,00 --> 01:13:57,50
SOMEONE<Sophia> withdraws gently, her gaze softening. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1079
01:14:01,00 --> 01:14:08,50
SOMEONE<Nina> marches down the hallway, her head bowed. SOMEONE<Sophia> stares after her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1080
01:14:07,00 --> 01:14:11,50
She turns away. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1081
01:14:08,00 --> 01:14:14,50
Shifting her increasingly troubled gaze, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1082
01:14:11,00 --> 01:14:15,50
she sets her jaw stubbornly. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1083
01:14:13,00 --> 01:14:18,50
Back at the butcher's house in the 19th century, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1084
01:14:15,00 --> 01:14:21,50
SOMEONE opens a heavy pair of wooden doors, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1085
01:14:18,00 --> 01:14:25,50
then accompanies SOMEONE<Lily> as she shuffles out with a somber expression. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1087
01:14:24,00 --> 01:14:28,50
SOMEONE<Flower> sighs gravely, her face still bruised. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1089
01:14:30,00 --> 01:14:35,50
Her laotong stands motionless. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1090
01:14:32,00 --> 01:14:37,50
SOMEONE<Flower> faces her and takes her hand. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1092
01:14:41,00 --> 01:14:46,50
Her friend doesn't look at her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1093
01:14:43,00 --> 01:14:47,50
SOMEONE's<Lily's> eyes blink heavily. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1094
01:14:47,00 --> 01:14:52,50
So much has happened in the years we were apart. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1095
01:14:50,00 --> 01:14:57,50
SOMEONE<Flower> listens with a gentle gaze, her head tilted to one side. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1099
01:15:09,00 --> 01:15:14,50
SOMEONE gives a solemn, understanding nod, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1100
01:15:11,00 --> 01:15:16,50
then looks down at their clasped hands. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1101
01:15:14,00 --> 01:15:18,50
SOMEONE<Lily> shuffles around to face her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1104
01:15:27,00 --> 01:15:32,50
Hand in hand, they leave the doorway. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1106
01:15:34,00 --> 01:15:39,50
SOMEONE<Flower> displays a wounded scowl. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1108
01:15:41,00 --> 01:15:45,50
SOMEONE<Lily> halts, her brow knitted. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1112
01:15:58,00 --> 01:16:04,50
SOMEONE<Flower> stares at her, then timidly works her full lips. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1114
01:16:10,00 --> 01:16:15,50
SOMEONE's<Lily's> chest heaves and she lowers her gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1115
01:16:13,00 --> 01:16:18,50
She leads her laotong onward with a pinched expression. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1122
01:16:36,00 --> 01:16:41,50
Beyond the open gate, the noblewoman's servants ready her palanquin. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1124
01:16:41,00 --> 01:16:47,50
SOMEONE<Flower> affectionately strokes her friend's arm. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1125
01:16:45,00 --> 01:16:50,50
There are things about men you SOMEONE<will> never know. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1126
01:16:48,00 --> 01:16:53,50
There are matters you do not understand. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1127
01:16:51,00 --> 01:16:56,50
SOMEONE<Lily> abruptly turns away and marches through the gate. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1128
01:16:54,00 --> 01:16:58,50
SOMEONE<Flower> follows. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1131
01:17:01,00 --> 01:17:05,50
The rebels have been stopped. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1132
01:17:03,00 --> 01:17:09,50
She pauses at the threshold, gazing out over the countryside. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1135
01:17:11,00 --> 01:17:17,50
Eyes glistening, SOMEONE<Lily> faces her laotong imploringly. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1136
01:17:14,00 --> 01:17:21,50
SOMEONE<Flower> clasps hands with her and looks uncertainly toward the palanquin. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1138
01:17:22,00 --> 01:17:27,50
SOMEONE<Flower> slowly turns and looks at her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1139
01:17:26,00 --> 01:17:33,50
She takes a deep breath, then gently withdraws her hands from SOMEONE's<Lily's> trembling grasp. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1140
01:17:36,00 --> 01:17:43,50
The noblewoman's eyes glisten but she gives an accepting nod and bows her head. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1141
01:17:43,00 --> 01:17:51,50
Now, SOMEONE and three other women sit at the side of a river beating wet clothes with clubs. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1145
01:18:00,00 --> 01:18:06,50
SOMEONE<Flower> glances at her, then shakes her head. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1147
01:18:07,00 --> 01:18:12,50
She and the other woman wring out a garment. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1148
01:18:09,00 --> 01:18:14,50
SOMEONE takes another sopping wet article of 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1159
01:18:40,00 --> 01:18:47,50
She takes a deep breath as a breeze blows wisps of hair across her face. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1160
01:18:44,00 --> 01:18:50,50
She raises her club and beats the laundry stoically. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1161
01:18:47,00 --> 01:18:56,50
Now at the SOMEONE house, Yang Gong helps SOMEONE downstairs to a foyer where the woman from SOMEONE's village waits. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1164
01:19:00,00 --> 01:19:05,50
SOMEONE<Lotus> reluctantly reaches into the folds of her clothing. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1165
01:19:05,00 --> 01:19:10,50
My sister asked me to return this to you. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1166
01:19:08,00 --> 01:19:14,50
She holds the folded fan out to the noblewoman. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1167
01:19:11,00 --> 01:19:16,50
SOMEONE<Lily> takes it and studies it with a knitted brow. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1168
01:19:14,00 --> 01:19:20,50
SOMEONE<Gang> gives a troubled frown as she peers at it over her lady's shoulder. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1169
01:19:18,00 --> 01:19:23,50
SOMEONE<Lily> turns the fan in her hands, her chest heaving. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1171
01:19:22,00 --> 01:19:27,50
She looks up at SOMEONE<Lotus> with glistening eyes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1172
01:19:24,00 --> 01:19:29,50
Avoiding her imperious gaze, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1173
01:19:27,00 --> 01:19:32,50
the messenger apologetically bows her head. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1175
01:19:32,00 --> 01:19:36,50
Her features set in a dazed expression, SOMEONE<Lily> turns away. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1176
01:19:34,00 --> 01:19:42,50
SOMEONE<Gang> reaches for her, but the noblewoman wrenches her arm out of her grasp and climbs the stairs alone. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1177
01:19:40,00 --> 01:19:44,50
Now in a dark space, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1178
01:19:41,00 --> 01:19:47,50
she opens the fan in a shaft of gentle light and reads. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1182
01:19:59,00 --> 01:20:06,50
Three sworn sisters in Jintian have promised to love me as I am. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1183
01:20:06,00 --> 01:20:10,50
You need not worry about me anymore. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1184
01:20:09,00 --> 01:20:15,50
Now, steam rises from bowls of food on a table. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1185
01:20:12,00 --> 01:20:19,50
SOMEONE<Lily> steps into view, her head jutting forward and her arms at her sides. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1186
01:20:17,00 --> 01:20:22,50
She pauses by a window and gazed outward. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1188
01:20:22,00 --> 01:20:28,50
Clutching the fan in one hand, she raises it to her waist and rests it on her other palm. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1189
01:20:25,00 --> 01:20:31,50
She stares off with a dazed, stricken expression. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1190
01:20:29,00 --> 01:20:34,50
Silhouetted against a window, she swallows hard, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1191
01:20:32,00 --> 01:20:38,50
then slowly doubles over and grasps a chair at the head of the table. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1192
01:20:36,00 --> 01:20:43,50
She sinks down, turning her back to us as she rests her head against her hand. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1193
01:20:40,00 --> 01:20:45,50
The fan drops from her grasp. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1195
01:20:44,00 --> 01:20:49,50
Now in her apartment, SOMEONE<Nina> continues reading the manuscript. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1196
01:20:47,00 --> 01:20:53,50
She sets one page aside and peruses the next with glistening eyes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1197
01:20:51,00 --> 01:20:58,50
A tear rolls along the side of her nose and another streams down her cheek. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1199
01:20:57,00 --> 01:21:04,50
several fans covered in writing sit on an open bundle of plain white cloth. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1200
01:21:02,00 --> 01:21:07,50
SOMEONE<Lily> sits slouched at the table. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1201
01:21:04,00 --> 01:21:09,50
while SOMEONE stands in attendance nearby. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1202
01:21:07,00 --> 01:21:12,50
The noblewoman waves feebly at the fans. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1206
01:21:18,00 --> 01:21:23,50
She bundles up the fans and carries them away. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1207
01:21:21,00 --> 01:21:28,50
SOMEONE<Lily> sits motionless as gentle firelight glows on her listless face. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1209
01:21:30,00 --> 01:21:37,50
In a gathering room, several women sit around a table with a bright red table cloth. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1210
01:21:35,00 --> 01:21:38,50
Words appear. Six months later. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1212
01:21:37,00 --> 01:21:43,50
The gathered women sew and enjoy refreshments as they sing. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1213
01:21:41,00 --> 01:21:46,50
One nods and smiles to SOMEONE<Lily>, who sits apart. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1214
01:21:43,00 --> 01:21:50,50
The noblewoman politely returns the gesture and makes an effort to sing along. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1215
01:21:47,00 --> 01:21:52,50
SOMEONE<Gang> arrives. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1217
01:21:52,00 --> 01:21:57,50
She grimly steps away. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1218
01:21:54,00 --> 01:22:02,50
SOMEONE lifts her gaze, her eyes shining, as SOMEONE comes in with her Jintian sisters. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1222
01:22:07,00 --> 01:22:11,50
An older woman speaks. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1223
01:22:09,00 --> 01:22:15,50
Thank you for traveling all this way to celebrate our daughter's wedding. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1224
01:22:14,00 --> 01:22:19,50
SOMEONE<Flower> humbly bows her head. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1225
01:22:16,00 --> 01:22:23,50
The mother of Cousin Yan gestures to a row of chairs and the newcomers sit. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1226
01:22:21,00 --> 01:22:27,50
SOMEONE<Lily> watches her estranged laotong with shining eyes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1227
01:22:24,00 --> 01:22:30,50
SOMEONE keeps her gaze fixed slightly downward, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1228
01:22:27,00 --> 01:22:32,50
avoiding everyone else's stare. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1229
01:22:29,00 --> 01:22:34,50
SOMEONE<Lotus> resumes the song. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1230
01:22:32,00 --> 01:22:38,50
SOMEONE's<Flower's> gaze drifts cautiously in SOMEONE's<Lily's> direction. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1231
01:22:36,00 --> 01:22:42,50
Her estranged laotong stares at the floor, her jaw set tight. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1232
01:22:41,00 --> 01:22:48,50
A servant arrives with a tray of refreshments and serves the newcomers. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1233
01:22:48,00 --> 01:22:54,50
SOMEONE's<Lily's> shoulders heave slowly beneath her ornate gown. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1235
01:22:54,00 --> 01:23:00,50
Moving hesitantly, she ventures a look at SOMEONE through her glistening eyes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1236
01:23:03,00 --> 01:23:07,50
Her old friend looks down, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1237
01:23:04,00 --> 01:23:12,50
Responding to her gregarious Jintian sisters with faint smiles and nods. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1238
01:23:09,00 --> 01:23:14,50
SOMEONE<Lily> averts her wounded gaze and stands. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1239
01:23:12,00 --> 01:23:19,50
The bride, her mother, and a few other guests take notice as she shuffles past the table. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1240
01:23:17,00 --> 01:23:23,50
SOMEONE pauses, turning her face slightly in SOMEONE's direction. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1241
01:23:21,00 --> 01:23:27,50
She continues onward, leaving the party. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1242
01:23:33,00 --> 01:23:39,50
Now, SOMEONE<Nina> wanders into the 19th century gathering room. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1243
01:23:39,00 --> 01:23:43,50
She stops and turns. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1245
01:23:42,00 --> 01:23:46,50
Across the room, SOMEONE sits alone. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1246
01:23:44,00 --> 01:23:49,50
She raises her head slowly and looks at SOMEONE<Nina>. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1247
01:23:47,00 --> 01:23:52,50
The contemporary woman regards her sadly. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1249
01:23:53,00 --> 01:23:58,50
From across the room, the two women of different eras hold each other's gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1250
01:23:56,00 --> 01:24:02,50
Now, traffic proceeds down a narrow city street. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1251
01:23:59,00 --> 01:24:06,50
At the gallery, SOMEONE's<Sophia's> aunt walks SOMEONE<Nina> through the exhibit on Chinese foot binding. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1252
01:24:04,00 --> 01:24:11,50
Large square black and white photographs of bare mutilated feet cover one wall. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1253
01:24:46,00 --> 01:24:54,50
Now, a plain brown high-rise stands crowded among similar buildings beneath an overcast sky. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1255
01:24:52,00 --> 01:24:58,50
an old woman in a bath robe leads SOMEONE<Nina> up a dank stairway. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1257
01:24:59,00 --> 01:25:04,50
They proceed down a hallway with chipping paint. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1259
01:25:04,00 --> 01:25:13,50
They pass rows of frosted glass windows, then arrive at an apartment with shoddily whitewashed brick walls. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1261
01:25:15,00 --> 01:25:19,50
The landlady leaves. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1262
01:25:17,00 --> 01:25:25,50
SOMEONE<Nina> steps through the doorway into the apartment and pauses to take in her surroundings with a grave expression. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1263
01:25:23,00 --> 01:25:30,50
Heading further in, she passes a mirror dotted with stickers and photographs. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1264
01:25:27,00 --> 01:25:33,50
Exposed wiring drapes across the crumbling brick walls. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1265
01:25:31,00 --> 01:25:36,50
SOMEONE passes a half-finished painting on an easel, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1266
01:25:34,00 --> 01:25:39,50
then a low unmade bed tucked in a corner. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1267
01:25:41,00 --> 01:25:49,50
Later, she sits at a desk littered with several stacks of books, manuscripts, and documents. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1268
01:25:47,00 --> 01:25:53,50
SOMEONE<Nina> flips through the pages of a small spiral bound notebook. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1270
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:57,50
We drift closer to her and find her lips slightly pursed as she reads. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1272
01:26:01,00 --> 01:26:08,50
In the notebook, a pen and ink sketch depicts a delicate tree amidst a desolate landscape. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1274
01:26:07,00 --> 01:26:14,50
On the opposite page, an illustration shows light from an oncoming train shining brightly from a round tunnel. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1275
01:26:12,00 --> 01:26:17,50
SOMEONE turns to the next page 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1276
01:26:14,00 --> 01:26:19,50
and finds it filled with writing. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1277
01:26:17,00 --> 01:26:23,50
Near the back cover, she discovers a folded letter addressed to her. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1278
01:27:17,00 --> 01:27:23,50
We see SOMEONE<Sophia> sitting in a red tinted bathtub. she sinks down slowly under the water. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1279
01:27:20,00 --> 01:27:24,50
Back at the desk, Shutting the notebook, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1282
01:27:25,00 --> 01:27:30,50
she notices a photograph tucked beneath the scattered pages of a manuscript draft. She pulls it out. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1286
01:27:35,00 --> 01:27:42,50
It features her and SOMEONE<Sophia> as teenagers clad in their matching red track suits. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1288
01:28:41,00 --> 01:28:48,50
SOMEONE<Nina> looks up at him and nods, her chest heaving beneath her black wool coat. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1289
01:28:46,00 --> 01:28:51,50
SOMEONE<Arthur> stares at her, then averts his stricken gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1290
01:29:04,00 --> 01:29:10,50
SOMEONE<Nina> looks up at him, her eyes wide and shining. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1291
01:29:08,00 --> 01:29:13,50
SOMEONE gives a stoic nod, then turns away, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1292
01:29:10,00 --> 01:29:16,50
his handsome features set in a haggard frown. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1293
01:29:15,00 --> 01:29:19,50
He gently leads her onward. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1294
01:29:18,00 --> 01:29:26,50
Now sitting on her bed at home, SOMEONE<Nina> removes the gray men's suit jacket from the plastic bag. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1295
01:29:23,00 --> 01:29:29,50
The finely-tailored garment unfolds gracefully as she holds it up. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1296
01:29:30,00 --> 01:29:34,50
Standing, she puts it on. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1297
01:29:32,00 --> 01:29:39,50
She wraps it tightly around her slender torso and hugs it close over her chest. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1298
01:29:37,00 --> 01:29:44,50
Her head droops forward and her eyes close as she strolls over to a sunny window. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1299
01:29:43,00 --> 01:29:52,50
She sways dreamily on her feet, then lifts her head and slips her hands into the pockets with a heavy sigh. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1300
01:29:56,00 --> 01:30:03,50
Looking down, she pulls out a small brass key with a circular toggle 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1301
01:30:00,00 --> 01:30:05,50
and a small, round plastic coil. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1302
01:30:03,00 --> 01:30:08,50
SOMEONE<Nina> frowns quizzically as she turns it in her fingertips. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1303
01:30:06,00 --> 01:30:13,50
Now, a pair of wood-framed glass doors bear stenciled Chinese characters. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1304
01:30:10,00 --> 01:30:16,50
Reversed letters beneath read "Yangtze Bath". 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1305
01:30:14,00 --> 01:30:18,50
SOMEONE<then> steps through the doors. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1307
01:30:17,00 --> 01:30:23,50
She crosses a waiting area and approaches a front desk. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1309
01:30:25,00 --> 01:30:30,50
His locker number is 173. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1311
01:30:31,00 --> 01:30:37,50
The burly bathhouse attendant stops eating and listens with a lifted brow. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1312
01:30:36,00 --> 01:30:41,50
We're not open yet. They're still cleaning. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1313
01:30:42,00 --> 01:30:47,50
Leading her into a room, he turns to a worker. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1316
01:30:49,00 --> 01:30:55,50
The worker stops spreading towels over loungers and leaves. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1319
01:30:57,00 --> 01:31:02,50
SOMEONE<Nina> gives a tiny bow and the man returns the gesture. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1320
01:31:00,00 --> 01:31:04,50
She waits as he heads off. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1322
01:31:05,00 --> 01:31:13,50
She makes her way to a bank of wooden lockers and skims her gaze over their numbers. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1324
01:31:12,00 --> 01:31:18,50
she slides the key into its lock and pulls open the door. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1326
01:31:17,00 --> 01:31:23,50
she finds a modest shrine in memory of SOMEONE's<Sophia's> father. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1327
01:31:21,00 --> 01:31:26,50
A rectangular wooden plaque stands upright 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1328
01:31:23,00 --> 01:31:29,50
bearing the man's photo and a panel of Chinese writing. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1329
01:31:26,00 --> 01:31:32,50
A few blue silk roses and pieces of citrus surround it. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1330
01:31:30,00 --> 01:31:35,50
SOMEONE<Nina> lifts a folded fan of the locker's shelf. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1332
01:31:36,00 --> 01:31:42,50
She opens it, spreading its creased paper panels and finds writing on each one. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1334
01:31:41,00 --> 01:31:47,50
Flipping it over, she sees writing on only half of the back panels. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1337
01:31:51,00 --> 01:31:56,50
She blinks her sad eyes and closes the fan.  

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1338
01:31:57,00 --> 01:32:01,50
Her gaze falls on something else in the locker and she tilts her head for a better look.  

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1339
01:31:58,00 --> 01:32:03,50
On the bottom shelf, she finds a stack of typed pages. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1340
01:32:00,00 --> 01:32:06,50
Taking them out, she reads the cover page "SnowFlower And The Secret Fan. " 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1342
01:32:06,00 --> 01:32:11,50
SOMEONE flips to the next page and reads, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1343
01:32:08,00 --> 01:32:14,50
her intent eyes fixed on her friend's completed manuscript. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1344
01:32:14,00 --> 01:32:21,50
The end of this story is about things of the heart that SOMEONE<will> never change. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1346
01:32:20,00 --> 01:32:25,50
Within the story, a girl stands in the doorway of SOMEONE's<Lily's> home. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1347
01:32:22,00 --> 01:32:29,50
As SOMEONE leads SOMEONE over, the girl enters and drops to her knees. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1350
01:32:33,00 --> 01:32:38,50
My mother is very sick. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1351
01:32:38,00 --> 01:32:43,50
She calls for you in her sleep. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1352
01:32:42,00 --> 01:32:46,50
SOMEONE's<Lily's> eyes fill with tears. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1353
01:32:44,00 --> 01:32:50,50
Gazing up at her, SOMEONE's daughter grimaces woefully. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1354
01:32:48,00 --> 01:32:52,50
A tear slides down her cheek. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1355
01:32:50,00 --> 01:32:54,50
SOMEONE<Lily> kneels down to the girl. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1356
01:32:52,00 --> 01:32:56,50
But she has other sisters. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1357
01:32:54,00 --> 01:32:59,50
She has no other sisters. She misled you. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1358
01:32:59,00 --> 01:33:03,50
She never had another laotong. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1359
01:33:02,00 --> 01:33:07,50
For ten years, she was only their teacher. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1360
01:33:05,00 --> 01:33:10,50
She has only one sister of the heart. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1361
01:33:09,00 --> 01:33:16,50
The girl's face crumbles in sobs as she grabs SOMEONE's<Lily's> hands. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1363
01:33:16,00 --> 01:33:20,50
SOMEONE<Lily> averts her gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1365
01:33:20,00 --> 01:33:25,50
SOMEONE<Lily> gazes off sadly. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1367
01:33:25,00 --> 01:33:32,50
Now, in a modest bedroom, SOMEONE lies on a sleeping platform with her hands folded on her chest. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1368
01:33:30,00 --> 01:33:34,50
Three women at her bedside leave. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1369
01:33:32,00 --> 01:33:38,50
As SOMEONE enters, SOMEONE's eyes remain closed. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1370
01:33:37,00 --> 01:33:42,50
SOMEONE hobbles to the raised bed, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1371
01:33:39,00 --> 01:33:44,50
her gaze fixed on her estranged laotong. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1372
01:33:42,00 --> 01:33:47,50
She pauses by SOMEONE's feet, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1373
01:33:45,00 --> 01:33:49,50
then inches closer. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1374
01:33:46,00 --> 01:33:53,50
She lowers herself to the edge of the platform and leans over SOMEONE<Snow>. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1376
01:33:53,00 --> 01:33:58,50
Brow creased, SOMEONE<Lily> stares down at her weakened sister. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1378
01:33:57,00 --> 01:34:03,50
SOMEONE<Flower> blinks, then looks at SOMEONE<Lily> through half closed eyes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1380
01:34:03,00 --> 01:34:09,50
SOMEONE<Lily> clutches her dying sister's hand. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1381
01:34:06,00 --> 01:34:11,50
Tears spill from her eyes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1382
01:34:08,00 --> 01:34:15,50
She gently squeezes SOMEONE's fingers as she gazes at the ailing woman. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1383
01:34:13,00 --> 01:34:19,50
Now, SOMEONE lies down beside SOMEONE on the bed. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1384
01:34:17,00 --> 01:34:22,50
She stretches her arm over her friend and holds her gently. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1386
01:34:26,00 --> 01:34:33,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE's daughter stand just outside the front door. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1390
01:34:37,00 --> 01:34:42,50
SOMEONE<Lily> finds a closed fan in the basket. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1393
01:34:47,00 --> 01:34:54,50
SOMEONE<Lily> opens it, revealing the columns of hand-painted characters on its panels. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1394
01:34:51,00 --> 01:34:58,50
She flips it over and gazes at the half-filled span of back side panels. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1395
01:34:55,00 --> 01:35:01,50
SOMEONE's bearded husband sits nearby, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1396
01:34:58,00 --> 01:35:04,50
watching his wife's laotong with a gentle gaze. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1398
01:35:06,00 --> 01:35:11,50
Later, in SOMEONE's bedroom, golden light shines through the windows, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1399
01:35:08,00 --> 01:35:13,50
casting a warm glow on SOMEONE's<Lily's> face. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1400
01:35:11,00 --> 01:35:20,50
She gazes at SOMEONE, who lies peacefully by with her eyes closed and her hands folded on her stomach. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1401
01:35:19,00 --> 01:35:24,50
Now, SOMEONE leans over her sister, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1402
01:35:22,00 --> 01:35:28,50
letting her face hover just inches from SOMEONE's<Snow>. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1403
01:35:25,00 --> 01:35:32,50
She extends her trembling fingers and rests them upon her laotong's cheek. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1405
01:35:37,00 --> 01:35:44,50
Now, tears shine in SOMEONE's<Lily's> eyes as she stares off with a distant expression. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1406
01:35:45,00 --> 01:35:51,50
When SOMEONE returned home after SOMEONE's funeral, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1407
01:35:49,00 --> 01:35:56,50
she looked at the fan and could not allow things to end as they had, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1408
01:35:56,00 --> 01:36:00,50
so she opened a new panel, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1409
01:36:00,00 --> 01:36:05,50
dipped her brush, and wrote a final inscription. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1410
01:36:03,00 --> 01:36:08,50
As a tear runs down SOMEONE's cheek, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1411
01:36:05,00 --> 01:36:12,50
she calmly works a bamboo stylus on a panel of the open fan, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1412
01:36:09,00 --> 01:36:14,50
leaving several characters in black ink. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1414
01:36:13,00 --> 01:36:19,50
In the present, SOMEONE<Nina> reads the manuscript page with doleful eyes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1415
01:36:17,00 --> 01:36:22,50
Still clutching the folded fan, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1416
01:36:19,00 --> 01:36:24,50
she lowers the sheet of paper and stares off. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1418
01:36:26,00 --> 01:36:33,50
An aerial view focuses on gleaming traffic and crowded highway lanes. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1419
01:36:33,00 --> 01:36:37,50
The world is always changing. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1420
01:36:36,00 --> 01:36:40,50
Every day it's changing. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1421
01:36:39,00 --> 01:36:44,50
Everything in life is changing. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1422
01:36:41,00 --> 01:36:48,50
We have to look inside ourselves to find what stays the same. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1423
01:36:45,00 --> 01:36:52,50
A view of a bustling sidewalk shows two girls walking arm in arm. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1428
01:36:59,00 --> 01:37:04,50
In a park, elderly women sit together on a bench. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1431
01:37:08,00 --> 01:37:14,50
Shanghai skyscrapers jut into the hazy sky. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1433
01:37:13,00 --> 01:37:20,50
At home, facing a window, SOMEONE<Nina> holds the fan and traces characters with her fingertip on the glass pane. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1439
01:37:40,00 --> 01:37:47,50
SOMEONE gazes out into a balcony where she imagines SOMEONE and SOMEONE at a table doing embroidery together. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1441
01:37:46,00 --> 01:37:54,50
Their 19th century attire contrasts with Shanghai's modern skyline behind them. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1442
01:37:51,00 --> 01:37:56,50
The women smile as they stitch. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1443
01:37:54,00 --> 01:37:59,50
SOMEONE glances at her laotong, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1444
01:37:56,00 --> 01:38:01,50
then shifts her gaze to SOMEONE<Nina>. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1445
01:37:58,00 --> 01:38:02,50
She opens her mouth to speak. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1446
01:38:04,00 --> 01:38:09,50
SOMEONE<Flower> offers SOMEONE<Nina> a smile instead. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1447
01:38:07,00 --> 01:38:13,50
SOMEONE lifts her steady eyes to her modern day counterpart 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1448
01:38:10,00 --> 01:38:16,50
and holds her gaze with a plain and tranquil expression. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1449
01:38:16,00 --> 01:38:24,50
Now, SOMEONE and SOMEONE stand side by side with their faces turned to each other. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1450
01:38:22,00 --> 01:38:26,50
SOMEONE gazes at her sister, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1451
01:38:23,00 --> 01:38:28,50
whose eyes are closed. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1453
01:38:26,00 --> 01:38:32,50
SOMEONE<Flower> shifts her attention to the cityscape before them. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1454
01:38:30,00 --> 01:38:37,50
SOMEONE<Lily> turns and both women stare out at the glittering metropolis. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1455
01:38:35,00 --> 01:38:40,50
SOMEONE takes SOMEONE's hand. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1457
01:38:39,00 --> 01:38:44,50
Now, in the hospital, SOMEONE<Nina> lies beside a bandaged and bruised SOMEONE<Sophia>. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1458
01:38:42,00 --> 01:38:48,50
SOMEONE's<Nina's> eyes pool with tears. SOMEONE's<Sophia's> remain closed. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1464
01:39:00,00 --> 01:39:06,50
And we SOMEONE<will> be sisters for 10,000 years. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1465
01:39:04,00 --> 01:39:09,50
Our view looks down on the two friend's faces. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1467
01:39:08,00 --> 01:39:13,50
Closing her eyes, SOMEONE<Nina> lifts SOMEONE's<Sophia's> hand onto her stomach. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1468
01:39:11,00 --> 01:39:16,50
She places the fan in the young woman's palm, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1469
01:39:14,00 --> 01:39:18,50
then closes her fingers around it. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1470
01:39:16,00 --> 01:39:21,50
She covers SOMEONE's<Sophia's> hand with her own. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1471
01:39:19,00 --> 01:39:24,50
As SOMEONE lies shoulder to shoulder with SOMEONE, 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1472
01:39:22,00 --> 01:39:27,50
the injured woman's eyelids slowly lift. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1473
01:39:26,00 --> 01:39:30,50
SOMEONE<Sophia> stares ahead. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1476
01:39:30,00 --> 01:39:35,50
Her eyes still closed, squeezes her sister's hands. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1478
01:39:41,00 --> 01:39:46,50
Her lips spread into a sleepy smile. Staring at the ceiling, SOMEONE<Sophia> gives a weary blink. 

SNOW_FLOWER_FD_DVS1480
01:39:47,00 --> 01:39:53,50
Brilliant light washes over their faces and blanches the screen to pure white.
