SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS13
00:02:49,00 --> 00:02:55,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> opens up a glowing capsule. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS14
00:03:01,00 --> 00:03:06,50
Faces appear on it like a nesting doll. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS15
00:03:15,00 --> 00:03:20,50
His depiction wears Victorian suit. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS16
00:03:38,00 --> 00:03:46,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> hikes across the Serengeti. Later, he hands a silver-dragon figurine to village boy. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS17
00:03:47,00 --> 00:03:56,50
He presents the figurine to a young swami. The boy studies it curiously. Later, SOMEONE<Balthazar> leaves

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS19
00:04:14,00 --> 00:04:19,50
New York City, 2000. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS21
00:04:40,00 --> 00:04:54,50
SOMEONE<David> draws on his window a picture of a gorilla being attacked by three airplanes. A few rows behind him, a perky blond girl laughs with her friends. Nicolas Cage. A chubby 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS22
00:04:56,00 --> 00:05:05,50
The drawing lines up with the Empire State Building outside. The blond girl offers a smile. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS23
00:05:03,00 --> 00:05:20,50
SOMEONE<Dave> gives a smitten grin. The girl looks back to her friends. SOMEONE<Dave> turns to the chubby boy, who gives him a thumbs up. A title appears with a dragon forming an S. The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Now outside, the kids sit facing New York Harbor. SOMEONE<Jay> Baruchel. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS24
00:05:24,00 --> 00:05:29,50
Other school kids pass it along. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS25
00:05:28,00 --> 00:05:35,50
girl receives it. It reads, "Check one. I would like to be SOMEONE's<David's> friend or girl

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS26
00:05:34,00 --> 00:05:43,50
SOMEONE<Becky> knits her brow and peers at him down the row of students. He smiles meekly. SOMEONE<Becky> grins and marks the note, hiding her answer. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS28
00:05:52,00 --> 00:06:00,50
He leaves the note on a concrete planter as the class heads off. SOMEONE starts toward it. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS29
00:05:58,00 --> 00:06:02,50
The note sticks to the tire of a passing bicycle. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS30
00:06:02,00 --> 00:06:06,50
he dashes after it. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS31
00:06:12,00 --> 00:06:17,50
halts and plucks off the note. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS32
00:06:16,00 --> 00:06:21,50
SOMEONE chases it, barreling around a corner 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS34
00:06:25,00 --> 00:06:33,50
She tosses it aside. SOMEONE follows the note through a narrow alley and emerges on a street littered with hundreds of loose notes. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS37
00:07:33,00 --> 00:07:42,50
SOMEONE<Dave> rubs a dusty Arabian oil lamp, then picks it up. A tray tips over, dropping a decanter. The panicked boy jumps. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS38
00:07:44,00 --> 00:07:49,50
but SOMEONE<Balthazar> catches it. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS39
00:08:14,00 --> 00:08:22,50
The stringy-haired sorcerer slowly faces the boy, studying him, then brushes past. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS40
00:08:25,00 --> 00:08:29,50
SOMEONE's<Dave's> jaw drops. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS41
00:08:29,00 --> 00:08:35,50
Struggling to peek over his shoulder, he turns in circles. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS42
00:08:33,00 --> 00:08:49,50
He treads toward SOMEONE<Balthazar> and eyes him uncertainly, then drops his gaze to a small black box. The sorcerer opens the lid, revealing the silver-dragon figurine. He gently picks it up and sets it in the palm of his hand. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS43
00:09:05,00 --> 00:09:12,50
SOMEONE<Dave> turns away and pads toward the doors. They swing shut by themselves. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS44
00:09:10,00 --> 00:09:25,50
He returns to SOMEONE<Balthazar> and hesitantly picks up the dragon. The sorcerer watches closely. As SOMEONE<Dave> holds the tiny dragon in his palm, it comes to life, sleepily shakes its head, and flaps its metal wings. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS45
00:09:25,00 --> 00:09:29,50
It crawls to the back, 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS46
00:09:33,00 --> 00:09:39,50
A green gemstone studs its back. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS47
00:10:08,00 --> 00:10:23,50
Now, SOMEONE<Balthazar> hurries downstairs into a basement. He kneels in front of the brick supporting the stairs and waves his hands. A red veneer crumbles away, revealing ancient darker bricks beneath.  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS48
00:10:21,00 --> 00:10:38,50
SOMEONE<Dave> studies his dragon ring, turning it to catch the light. With each movement, boxes on a high shelf quake. SOMEONE<Dave> jerks his hand to one side and the boxes tumble off the shelf. As he makes a light knocking motion, a wall buckles.  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS49
00:10:35,00 --> 00:10:40,50
He does it harder and the wall shatters. The doll falls to the floor. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS51
00:10:42,00 --> 00:10:57,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> opens a door in the bricks and slides out SOMEONE's<Merlin's> ancient spell book. Upstairs, SOMEONE<Dave> picks up the nesting doll and studies the painting of SOMEONE's<Horvath's> unhappy face. The SOMEONE<Grimhold> magically unseals. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS52
00:10:59,00 --> 00:11:11,50
The boy drops it and the two halves of the outermost nesting doll open. A roach crawls out, then another. Hundreds of roaches pour out of the doll and scuttle into a heap. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS53
00:11:10,00 --> 00:11:18,50
The roaches, now numbering in the thousands, swarm into a growing tower.  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS54
00:11:20,00 --> 00:11:26,50
It takes on a man head and top hat. He takes a breath and becomes real. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS55
00:11:26,00 --> 00:11:32,50
The last roaches melt into his skin and scurry into his mouth. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS56
00:11:40,00 --> 00:11:45,50
A blue jewel topping his cane. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS57
00:11:45,00 --> 00:11:49,50
SOMEONE<his> pins him to the ceiling. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS58
00:12:01,00 --> 00:12:06,50
SOMEONE<Dave> points to it. SOMEONE<Horvath> grabs his cane and blasts him backwards.  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS59
00:12:09,00 --> 00:12:14,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> plummets. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS60
00:12:21,00 --> 00:12:24,50
SOMEONE<Dave> hides.  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS61
00:12:30,00 --> 00:12:35,50
The innermost doll now shows a man with a high forehead and long fingernail 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS62
00:12:36,00 --> 00:12:41,50
He has a bulky rings on their right index. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS64
00:12:48,00 --> 00:12:53,50
He snaps the horn off a unicorn's skull and defends 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS65
00:13:08,00 --> 00:13:13,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> topples over. A jar falls off. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS66
00:13:18,00 --> 00:13:22,50
He fires it at SOMEONE. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS68
00:13:25,00 --> 00:13:29,50
SOMEONE side with his cane, He fireballs at SOMEONE. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS69
00:13:28,00 --> 00:13:34,50
Behind SOMEONE<Horvath> falls toward the door, cradling the SOMEONE<Grimhold>. SOMEONE<Horvath> notices him. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS70
00:13:37,00 --> 00:13:41,50
he grabs SOMEONE's leg and reels into the urn,  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS71
00:13:46,00 --> 00:13:50,50
The lid shuts.  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS72
00:13:49,00 --> 00:13:57,50
SOMEONE<Dave> rushes outside and hurls the SOMEONE<Grimhold> away. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS73
00:14:04,00 --> 00:14:11,50
He follows his teacher into the store. They find everything back to normal. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS74
00:14:09,00 --> 00:14:16,50
SOMEONE<Dave> looks around and notices the SOMEONE<Han> Dynasty urn standing upright. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS75
00:14:16,00 --> 00:14:21,50
teacher steers him back outside. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS76
00:14:37,00 --> 00:15:01,50
Back in the shop, the lid sits tightly atop the urn. Beneath its tapered neck, warlike paintings adorn its bulbous body. Among the angry and fearful faces, a man with shaggy hair like SOMEONE's<Balthazar's> grips the shoulder of a goateed man holding a cane aloft. Cut to black. Words appear Ten Years Later, to the Day. An alarm clock reads, 7:00. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS77
00:14:59,00 --> 00:15:07,50
A young man fumbles to turn it off, then finds a full-grown bulldog lying on his chest. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS78
00:15:07,00 --> 00:15:11,50
turns off his wristwatch. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS79
00:15:10,00 --> 00:15:16,50
He scratches the dog's ear. Later, his roommate tosses him a gift. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS80
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:49,50
He takes socks from a bureau. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS81
00:15:50,00 --> 00:15:55,50
The dragon ring lies beneath. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS82
00:15:55,00 --> 00:16:00,50
SOMEONE<Bennet> shows a wolf calendar. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS83
00:16:27,00 --> 00:16:33,50
Now in a classroom, SOMEONE assembles his mushroom-like device. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS84
00:16:36,00 --> 00:16:44,50
He collects pages off the floor, then moves among the lecture seats, where a paper sits at a young woman's feet. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS85
00:16:42,00 --> 00:16:50,50
Agog, SOMEONE<Dave> sweeps his gaze up her stockinged legs to the blond woman's lovely face. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS86
00:16:51,00 --> 00:17:02,50
She looks away. With a nod, SOMEONE<Dave> turns to head off, then turns back and furrows his brow. The woman's blue eyes briefly meet his gaze. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS87
00:17:06,00 --> 00:17:10,50
She nods. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS88
00:17:08,00 --> 00:17:13,50
She blinks confusedly. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS89
00:17:52,00 --> 00:18:07,50
Now in a posh apartment, the SOMEONE<Han> Dynasty urn stands by a hall doorway. As a gray-haired man passes, the urn quivers. The man returns and stares at it. The urn's side depicts the fighting sorcerers. Meanwhile, 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS90
00:18:12,00 --> 00:18:17,50
he catches up to her on the sidewalk. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS92
00:18:43,00 --> 00:18:48,50
Lightning flashes, striking a metal tower on 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS93
00:18:55,00 --> 00:19:00,50
SOMEONE<Dave> draws their attention. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS94
00:19:01,00 --> 00:19:05,50
SOMEONE<Becky> gapes. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS96
00:19:11,00 --> 00:19:18,50
SOMEONE<Becky> and another guy stare blankly. SOMEONE<Dave> nods, then uses a control pad. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS97
00:19:23,00 --> 00:19:28,50
SOMEONE<Dave> pumps his fist. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS98
00:19:44,00 --> 00:19:49,50
He averts his bashful gaze. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS99
00:19:47,00 --> 00:19:57,50
SOMEONE<Dave> collects his jacket and umbrella, then glances at SOMEONE<Becky>, who gives a shrug and a smile. Looking away, SOMEONE<Dave> nods awkwardly. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS100
00:20:17,00 --> 00:20:21,50
He turns on a radio. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS101
00:20:30,00 --> 00:20:35,50
SOMEONE<Dave> stands inside a protective chamber. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS102
00:20:56,00 --> 00:21:05,50
City lights glimmer in the night. In the posh apartment, the gray-haired man glares at the trembling urn. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS103
00:21:17,00 --> 00:21:22,50
The ash cloud hovers. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS104
00:21:27,00 --> 00:21:31,50
A man appears with brows and goatee. Smoke puffs from his mouth. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS105
00:21:31,00 --> 00:21:36,50
She falls off. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS106
00:21:35,00 --> 00:21:39,50
He lifts the urn to a window. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS108
00:21:48,00 --> 00:21:53,50
As the urn plummets, another stream of ash flies from it. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS110
00:22:01,00 --> 00:22:06,50
SOMEONE steps onto a sidewalk 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS111
00:22:06,00 --> 00:22:11,50
he glances at a crowd gathered around the broken urn 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS112
00:22:09,00 --> 00:22:16,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> stops and stares at the Chrysler Building, its illuminated crown agleam in the night eagles mounted on a high. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS114
00:22:19,00 --> 00:22:24,50
He places his open hand on its back. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS115
00:22:23,00 --> 00:22:43,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Dave> enters his apartment, flips on a lamp, and sets down his belongings. As he opens the fridge and peeks inside, SOMEONE<Horvath> watches from the other room. Squinting, SOMEONE<Dave> notices a report put up on his fridge. It reads, SOMEONE<David> Stutler, Fourth Grade, B-, The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS116
00:23:24,00 --> 00:23:28,50
his hand and a knife flies into it. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS117
00:23:28,00 --> 00:23:33,50
SOMEONE<Dave> bolts for the closed door.  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS118
00:23:31,00 --> 00:23:38,50
He then stands and races outside. SOMEONE<Horvath> spots SOMEONE's<Bennet's> wolf calendar. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS119
00:23:37,00 --> 00:23:41,50
As SOMEONE races 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS120
00:23:39,00 --> 00:23:45,50
he pauses and looks at his apartment. His jaw drops as 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS121
00:23:47,00 --> 00:23:56,50
SOMEONE<Dave> rushes up some stairs, then stops on a landing, and watches the wolves advance past the man entering the apartment building. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS123
00:23:57,00 --> 00:24:03,50
subway station door, SOMEONE<Dave> swipes his card. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS124
00:24:07,00 --> 00:24:15,50
One wolf leans upright on the revolving door's bars. SOMEONE<Dave> sprints away. Now, a wolf 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS125
00:24:13,00 --> 00:24:19,50
open a door and leads the others onto a subway platform. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS126
00:24:16,00 --> 00:24:23,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> enters behind them. SOMEONE<Dave> hides on the sunken subway tracks. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS127
00:24:24,00 --> 00:24:29,50
He looks across the track and sees a wolf. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS128
00:24:37,00 --> 00:24:41,50
As the wolves leap for SOMEONE, Two puppies land on his chest. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS130
00:24:44,00 --> 00:24:51,50
As SOMEONE shifts his eyes, a giant talon knocks him 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS131
00:24:55,00 --> 00:25:00,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> looks down. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS132
00:24:58,00 --> 00:25:02,50
SOMEONE rises 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS133
00:25:10,00 --> 00:25:16,50
commands a newspaper to fly flat onto the train driver's 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS134
00:25:14,00 --> 00:25:18,50
climbs onto the eagle 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS135
00:25:25,00 --> 00:25:33,50
He quickly dives off the tracks. He stares after SOMEONE<Balthazar>. Now at the Chrysler Building, pigeons flutter off the 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS136
00:25:37,00 --> 00:25:42,50
He leans over the balcony railing. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS137
00:25:48,00 --> 00:25:54,50
The full-bodied eagle heads back to its corner on 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS138
00:25:53,00 --> 00:25:58,50
It transforms into the decorative 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS139
00:25:59,00 --> 00:26:03,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> picks up a pigeon. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS140
00:26:44,00 --> 00:26:49,50
He binds the pigeon's leg. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS141
00:26:53,00 --> 00:26:58,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> releases the bird. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS142
00:27:15,00 --> 00:27:20,50
He turns away. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS144
00:28:07,00 --> 00:28:15,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> holds SOMEONE's<Dave's> gaze. The young man shifts his eyes, then nods. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS145
00:28:13,00 --> 00:28:20,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> strides past SOMEONE<Dave>, to the decorative eagle, and climbs onto it. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS146
00:28:25,00 --> 00:28:29,50
As SOMEONE flutters 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS147
00:28:44,00 --> 00:28:49,50
at an impound garage. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS148
00:28:51,00 --> 00:28:56,50
SOMEONE<Dave> eyes SOMEONE's<Balthazar's> vintage Rolls. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS149
00:29:00,00 --> 00:29:04,50
Now, SOMEONE<Balthazar> drives the dusty Rolls. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS150
00:29:12,00 --> 00:29:16,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> swerves. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS151
00:29:59,00 --> 00:30:03,50
meter maid recoils from a burning ticket. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS152
00:30:14,00 --> 00:30:23,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Horvath> strolls from an alley to the former Arcana Cabana, its front window now aglow with neon signs. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS153
00:30:23,00 --> 00:30:27,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> closes his eyes. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS154
00:30:28,00 --> 00:30:32,50
He reviews the past. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS155
00:30:40,00 --> 00:30:44,50
SOMEONE sees SOMEONE tossing the doll. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS156
00:30:44,00 --> 00:30:55,50
SOMEONE's<Horvath's> smoky vision shows an old Chinese woman finding the SOMEONE<Grimhold>. Its outermost portrait still shows the man with long fingernails. In reality, headlight 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS157
00:31:03,00 --> 00:31:10,50
the man  got shot through his windshield. SOMEONE<Horvath> shifts his eyes. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS159
00:31:10,00 --> 00:31:16,50
Now, yellow-and-red confetti fills the air and round red lanterns hang above the street. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS160
00:31:22,00 --> 00:31:26,50
a team of puppeteers operating. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS161
00:31:31,00 --> 00:31:38,50
SOMEONE<Dave> grimaces as SOMEONE<Balthazar> heads into a building and up a flight of stairs. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS162
00:31:35,00 --> 00:31:41,50
Two spectators stare curiously at SOMEONE<Dave> and he nods at SOMEONE<Inside>. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS163
00:31:41,00 --> 00:32:07,50
Inside the building, SOMEONE<Balthazar> cautiously heads toward a door marked with Chinese writing. He pauses and waves his hand over it. As he makes his way into a shop, a butterfly flits off a table. SOMEONE<Balthazar> runs his hand over various items, then stops in front of a figurine covered in acupuncture needles. He waves his hand around it. The elderly woman from SOMEONE's<Horvath's> replay of the past steps out from behind a curtain. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS164
00:32:26,00 --> 00:32:31,50
Subtitles appear Your hair is beautiful. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS165
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:56,50
The long-finger nailed man appears. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS166
00:32:55,00 --> 00:33:00,50
Hundreds of acupuncture needles rise. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS167
00:33:09,00 --> 00:33:14,50
The bare-chested man rises. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS168
00:33:17,00 --> 00:33:22,50
SOMEONE<Dave> looks up at the window. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS169
00:33:21,00 --> 00:33:32,50
SOMEONE<Dave> bolts. SOMEONE<Sun-Lok> runs his curled nails over a dragon-shaped buckle on his belt. It starts to move. Meanwhile, the dragon puppet in the parade. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS171
00:33:52,00 --> 00:33:56,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> blows confetti over the street. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS172
00:33:56,00 --> 00:34:00,50
invisibility for everyone, including 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS173
00:33:59,00 --> 00:34:04,50
As SOMEONE races into a hair salon. SOMEONE<Dave> narrowly escapes. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS174
00:34:08,00 --> 00:34:21,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Balthazar> crosses the curio shop. As SOMEONE<Horvath> hides around a corner, the strands of a beaded curtain take the SOMEONE<Morganian> by the neck and arms. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS176
00:34:28,00 --> 00:34:34,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> leaps out the window. Meanwhile, the dragon chases SOMEONE<Dave>. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS177
00:34:45,00 --> 00:34:51,50
SOMEONE<Dave> points his ring at the sorcerer. The dragon draws closer. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS179
00:35:04,00 --> 00:35:10,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> shows a smidge with his fingers. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS180
00:35:21,00 --> 00:35:26,50
The dragon climbs up the building toward SOMEONE<Dave,>.  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS181
00:35:35,00 --> 00:35:40,50
He closes his eyes. Light glows from SOMEONE's ring. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS182
00:35:51,00 --> 00:35:55,50
He finds himself in the puppet's 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS183
00:35:59,00 --> 00:36:03,50
his hands victoriously. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS184
00:36:04,00 --> 00:36:13,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> stares down at the SOMEONE<Grimhold>. The next doll shows a Puritan girl. SOMEONE<Dave> approaches. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS185
00:36:17,00 --> 00:36:25,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> watches from the curio shop window and sees SOMEONE<Dave> wearing SOMEONE's<Merlin's> ring. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS186
00:36:23,00 --> 00:36:29,50
Two NYPD cruisers arrive on the scene. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS188
00:36:31,00 --> 00:36:38,50
As two cops approach, SOMEONE<Balthazar> and SOMEONE<Dave> are suddenly dressed as policemen. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS189
00:36:54,00 --> 00:37:01,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> lifts his brow. One of the cops stares at SOMEONE<Dave>, who tips his hat. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS190
00:37:00,00 --> 00:37:05,50
The officers head past the imposters. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS191
00:37:09,00 --> 00:37:15,50
Now, SOMEONE<Dave> joins SOMEONE<Balthazar> in his Phantom. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS192
00:37:22,00 --> 00:37:29,50
SOMEONE<Dave> eyes the ring on his finger. SOMEONE<Balthazar> watches him steadily. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS193
00:37:29,00 --> 00:37:34,50
The sorcerer gives a pleased smile. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS194
00:37:38,00 --> 00:37:42,50
SOMEONE's car pulls 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS197
00:38:01,00 --> 00:38:07,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> sets the SOMEONE<Grimhold> down and it becomes invisible. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS198
00:38:09,00 --> 00:38:15,50
He presents a matchbox-sized book. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS199
00:38:15,00 --> 00:38:19,50
He unfolds it repeatedly. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS200
00:38:18,00 --> 00:38:23,50
It doubles in size each time. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS201
00:38:26,00 --> 00:38:31,50
He gives the now-enormous tome to SOMEONE, who 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS202
00:38:31,00 --> 00:38:35,50
SOMEONE opens the big book. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS203
00:38:34,00 --> 00:38:40,50
It depicts SOMEONE<Dave> in a cowardly scream. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS205
00:38:52,00 --> 00:39:02,50
SOMEONE<Dave> obeys. Standing in the center of the turnaround-circular platform, SOMEONE<Balthazar> raises his hands. The lights dim. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS206
00:39:00,00 --> 00:39:05,50
The sorcerer flourishes his hands. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS207
00:39:07,00 --> 00:39:12,50
SOMEONE wills the flames down to the level of his wrist,  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS208
00:39:10,00 --> 00:39:16,50
then guides them with his hands.  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS209
00:39:21,00 --> 00:39:26,50
Fiery light within the larger circle. SOMEONE<Balthazar> stands

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS210
00:40:01,00 --> 00:40:09,50
Picking his way over the now ankle-high green flames, he joins SOMEONE<Balthazar> at the circle's center. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS211
00:40:37,00 --> 00:40:42,50
He tosses some to SOMEONE<Dave>. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS212
00:40:45,00 --> 00:40:51,50
He notices SOMEONE<Balthazar> wearing an identical pair. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS213
00:40:54,00 --> 00:41:08,50
Now, a neon sign over a burger stand reads, "The Corner. " A figure with a walking stick approaches as two customers leave with their order. Inside, the fry cook pauses. On the griddle, pentagrams 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS214
00:41:05,00 --> 00:41:15,50
sear themselves into the tops of two burgers. The cook looks over his shoulder at the customer window. Later, he stands with SOMEONE<Horvath>

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS215
00:41:29,00 --> 00:41:33,50
in SOMEONE's lab 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS216
00:41:38,00 --> 00:41:43,50
SOMEONE wears a catcher's mask and pad 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS218
00:42:01,00 --> 00:42:06,50
it falls to the ground. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS220
00:42:12,00 --> 00:42:18,50
The recoil from another knocks him over. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS221
00:42:20,00 --> 00:42:25,50
A bulb bounces off the padding over SOMEONE's 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS222
00:42:25,00 --> 00:42:35,50
plasma ball returns and hits him again. Now, we peer up at a gold-trimmed high rise. Inside, SOMEONE<Horvath> slips into a luxurious penthouse. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS223
00:42:48,00 --> 00:42:55,50
A poster featuring a man with spiky bleached hair gives the name, "Drake Stone. " 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS224
00:42:54,00 --> 00:43:02,50
A trophy reads, "Magician of the Year 2009. " In a parlor, a woman paints his nails black. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS225
00:43:05,00 --> 00:43:10,50
Other female attendants turn. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS226
00:43:23,00 --> 00:43:27,50
A bald man leaves with him. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS227
00:43:54,00 --> 00:43:59,50
Doffing his hat, SOMEONE<Horvath> steps forward. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS228
00:44:02,00 --> 00:44:06,50
Now, SOMEONE shoots a fire 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS229
00:44:12,00 --> 00:44:17,50
a flame in his upturned palm. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS230
00:44:14,00 --> 00:44:19,50
He blows it like a kiss 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS231
00:44:26,00 --> 00:44:31,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> nods and smiles. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS232
00:44:34,00 --> 00:44:39,50
SOMEONE<Dave>, knocking him onto his back. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS233
00:44:42,00 --> 00:44:49,50
Now on an outdoor bench, SOMEONE<Balthazar> takes several sandwiches from a paper bag. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS234
00:44:57,00 --> 00:45:03,50
SOMEONE<Dave> turns and gawks as SOMEONE<Becky> leaves a nearby building. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS235
00:45:30,00 --> 00:45:39,50
The young man shifts his rueful gaze. He eyes SOMEONE<Becky> with a furrowed brow, then springs up and hurries after her. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS236
00:45:51,00 --> 00:45:55,50
SOMEONE<Dave> and SOMEONE<Becky> enter a subway station. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS237
00:46:18,00 --> 00:46:23,50
SOMEONE<Dave> takes a deep breath and chases the mugger. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS238
00:46:27,00 --> 00:46:31,50
revolving gate. SOMEONE<Dave> locks it

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS239
00:47:05,00 --> 00:47:10,50
Now SOMEONE<Dave> rejoins SOMEONE<Becky>, passing two cops. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS240
00:47:24,00 --> 00:47:31,50
He holds up his fists. A train arrives. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS241
00:47:40,00 --> 00:47:43,50
He boards it. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS242
00:47:53,00 --> 00:47:58,50
SOMEONE<Becky> gapes. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS243
00:48:02,00 --> 00:48:13,50
SOMEONE<Dave> gazes wistfully after the departing train. As we revolve around him, we discover SOMEONE<Balthazar> glowering behind his shoulder. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS244
00:48:21,00 --> 00:48:28,50
Daytime. At the Wall Street Bull sculpture, SOMEONE<Horvath> thoughtfully takes in his surrounding

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS245
00:48:44,00 --> 00:48:49,50
He finds SOMEONE signing autographs for fans 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS246
00:48:50,00 --> 00:48:53,50
leaves them. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS247
00:49:03,00 --> 00:49:08,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> grimly touches the bull statue. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS248
00:49:07,00 --> 00:49:14,50
An NYU sticker decorates it. Now, SOMEONE<Balthazar> levitates in a chair. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS249
00:50:13,00 --> 00:50:17,50
He leaves. Now, his Rolls 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS250
00:50:17,00 --> 00:50:24,50
the stone gargoyle. From the driver's seat, SOMEONE<Balthazar> peers at his

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS251
00:50:21,00 --> 00:50:40,50
old storefront. Later, he descends the spiral stairway into the basement, which is now stocked with boxes and printing supplies. Crouching at the wall beneath the stairs, he moves a poster board aside.  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS252
00:50:38,00 --> 00:50:49,50
He arcs his hands before the bricks, exposing a hatch. Opening it, he pulls a canvas bag from compartment, reaches inside, and pulls out a roll of muslin. He gingerly unrolls it to reveal an arcane depiction of a spell being cast. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS253
00:50:50,00 --> 00:51:05,50
Now, SOMEONE<Balthazar> puts the scroll back and takes out a red-velvet bundle. He unfolds it to reveal a delicate drop-pendant necklace. Back at the lab, SOMEONE<Dave> sets up a network of cables around a metal cage in the SOMEONE<Merlin> Circle. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS254
00:51:24,00 --> 00:51:30,50
SOMEONE<Dave> enters the cage. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS255
00:51:36,00 --> 00:51:41,50
SOMEONE<Becky> joins him. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS256
00:51:44,00 --> 00:51:52,50
At the turn of a dial, the lights fade out. SOMEONE<Dave> types a command on a computer. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS257
00:51:55,00 --> 00:52:02,50
Plasma zaps the cage from all directions. SOMEONE<Becky> ducks, then stares. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS259
00:52:16,00 --> 00:52:22,50
SOMEONE<Dave> regards her tenderly, then types in a new command. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS260
00:52:22,00 --> 00:52:27,50
SOMEONE's<Becky's> jaw drops. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS261
00:52:27,00 --> 00:52:32,50
Her eyes widen and she gawks at SOMEONE<Dave>. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS263
00:53:06,00 --> 00:53:14,50
Later, a banner outside a building reads, "New York University Athletics. " SOMEONE and SOMEONE stroll up. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS265
00:53:21,00 --> 00:53:26,50
He walks her to a yoga class. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS267
00:53:51,00 --> 00:53:55,50
Later in a men's room, SOMEONE<Drake> approaches him. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS268
00:54:01,00 --> 00:54:06,50
He gives the floor a scuffing kick 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS269
00:54:16,00 --> 00:54:21,50
grabbing SOMEONE by the collar 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS270
00:54:25,00 --> 00:54:29,50
He walks away, but SOMEONE stays pinned 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS271
00:54:38,00 --> 00:54:44,50
SOMEONE<Dave> flexes his fingers, then propels his hands forward. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS272
00:54:56,00 --> 00:55:02,50
SOMEONE<Drake> obeys his arriving master. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS273
00:55:15,00 --> 00:55:19,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> corners him. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS274
00:56:07,00 --> 00:56:12,50
SOMEONE<Dave> opens his mouth to speak. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS275
00:56:10,00 --> 00:56:16,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> presses the knob of his walking stick to his lips. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS276
00:56:15,00 --> 00:56:24,50
He backs off a step and lowers the magical cane. SOMEONE<Dave> glares darkly at the evil magician. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS277
00:56:25,00 --> 00:56:31,50
The young man shakes his head and screws his mouth up. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS278
00:56:41,00 --> 00:56:45,50
fluid impresses SOMEONE 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS279
00:57:04,00 --> 00:57:09,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> propels SOMEONE<Drake> into a stall. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS280
00:57:15,00 --> 00:57:19,50
pause on their way downstairs. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS281
00:57:37,00 --> 00:57:45,50
Meanwhile, trapped in the mirror, SOMEONE<Horvath> sees a student walk by.  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS282
00:57:43,00 --> 00:57:47,50
He knocks on the surface causing it to ripple. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS283
00:57:48,00 --> 00:57:55,50
The student nods uneasily, flashes a meek smile, and faints. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS284
00:57:55,00 --> 00:58:01,50
Now, we view illustrations in the Incantus. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS285
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:24,50
He ignites the SOMEONE<Merlin> Circle. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS286
00:59:42,00 --> 00:59:48,50
SOMEONE<Dave> regards SOMEONE's<Merlin's> ring on his finger. Now at an NYU 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS287
00:59:47,00 --> 00:59:53,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> arrogantly taps a clerk's computer with his cane. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS288
01:00:04,00 --> 01:00:11,50
The clerk grows mesmerized by the glowing gemstone on his cane. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS289
01:00:15,00 --> 01:00:24,50
As SOMEONE<Horvath> irritably rolls his eyes, SOMEONE's<Drake's> grin fades. The clerk locates SOMEONE's<Dave's> record. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS290
01:00:24,00 --> 01:00:29,50
In the lab, SOMEONE<Dave> sits down. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS291
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:52,50
SOMEONE<Dave> sees his dog chewing on some cables. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS292
01:00:51,00 --> 01:00:56,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> beckons his apprentice. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS293
01:00:54,00 --> 01:00:59,50
They study the retrieved scroll. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS294
01:01:15,00 --> 01:01:21,50
They both take a look at the bulldog gnawing at one of the Tesla coils. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS295
01:01:25,00 --> 01:01:31,50
A wall clock reads, 7:45. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS296
01:01:54,00 --> 01:01:59,50
cleaning supplies from a storage cage, a push broom 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS297
01:01:58,00 --> 01:02:03,50
later, he mops up the spilled soda. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS298
01:02:03,00 --> 01:02:07,50
now reads, 7:50. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS299
01:02:06,00 --> 01:02:15,50
He eyes takeout containers and a pizza box. Tank pees on the floor. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS300
01:02:15,00 --> 01:02:29,50
His gaze lands on the Incantus. Later, the book lies open under his finger. As a circle of low red flames burns around him, SOMEONE<Dave> scoops his ring-bearing hand upward, directing the

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS301
01:02:26,00 --> 01:02:35,50
at a distant mop. The mop stands, then bobs up and down. SOMEONE<Dave> waves his hand like a conductor. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS302
01:02:38,00 --> 01:02:43,50
broom which nudges a push broom awake. Both join the mop and the mop stands alertly on three 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS304
01:02:45,00 --> 01:02:50,50
It pirouettes, disturbing Tank from 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS306
01:02:55,00 --> 01:02:59,50
A stack of dirty plates levitates over to the sink 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS308
01:03:05,00 --> 01:03:11,50
Two unsupervised mops come alive at the storage cage. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS309
01:03:28,00 --> 01:03:34,50
SOMEONE<Dave> finishes taking a shower and towels dry. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS310
01:03:33,00 --> 01:03:39,50
Wearing a plain-white shirt, he runs an electric toothbrush down his tongue. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS311
01:03:37,00 --> 01:03:44,50
Now zipping up a hooded sweatshirt and wearing SOMEONE's ring, he returns 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS312
01:03:45,00 --> 01:03:50,50
Dozens of mops slosh his Tesla equipment. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS313
01:03:51,00 --> 01:03:56,50
A hovering spray bottle sprays SOMEONE's<Dave's> face. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS316
01:04:10,00 --> 01:04:13,50
Four electrical wall outlets sink the rising water 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS317
01:04:18,00 --> 01:04:25,50
His shadow on the wall shows him swinging, but the mop head strings dodge each blow. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS318
01:04:44,00 --> 01:04:51,50
pushes on his butt. As SOMEONE<Becky> eyes him curiously, he hangs his head. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS319
01:04:59,00 --> 01:05:05,50
As he covers his face, both sneaky mops imitate him. Downstairs 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS320
01:05:24,00 --> 01:05:29,50
spreading his arms wide from the balcony. All of the enchant 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS322
01:06:22,00 --> 01:06:31,50
SOMEONE<Dave> angrily looks away, his jaw clenching in a defiant expression. SOMEONE<Balthazar> reflects. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS323
01:06:31,00 --> 01:06:35,50
SOMEONE<Dave> removes his ring. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS324
01:06:34,00 --> 01:06:41,50
He thrusts a hand in the direction of an empty chair. Nothing happens. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS325
01:06:48,00 --> 01:06:52,50
He fetches his sneakers. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS326
01:07:01,00 --> 01:07:07,50
He changes out of his pointy footwear. Now in the city. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS327
01:07:08,00 --> 01:07:15,50
SOMEONE<Dave> follows a sidewalk by himself. Later, he passes a park. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS328
01:07:15,00 --> 01:07:26,50
Farther along, he approaches a window to a coffee house marked, "Communication Cafe. " He spies SOMEONE inside, conversing cheerfully with a group of girlfriends. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS329
01:07:36,00 --> 01:07:43,50
SOMEONE<Dave> turns away sadly and leaves. SOMEONE<Becky> spots him in a mirror. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS330
01:07:40,00 --> 01:07:47,50
She turns to find him walking away, then excuses herself from her friends. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS331
01:07:49,00 --> 01:08:15,50
Now, the Chrysler Building's art deco apex gleams in the night. On the lofty observation ledge, a service light glows amber in contrast to a row of stark floodlights. SOMEONE<Dave> steps out to the handrail, smirks sadly, and removes SOMEONE's<Merlin's> ring. He joggles it in his cupped hand as he faces the breathtaking cityscape. SOMEONE<Becky> arrives behind him. As SOMEONE<Dave> winds up to throw the ring, she interjects. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS332
01:08:13,00 --> 01:08:17,50
He pockets it. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS333
01:09:03,00 --> 01:09:08,50
She lets him lead her to the railing. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS334
01:10:12,00 --> 01:10:19,50
Back at the dripping-wet lab, SOMEONE<Balthazar> dries off the Incantus. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS335
01:10:19,00 --> 01:10:24,50
SOMEONE<Dave> arrives. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS336
01:10:34,00 --> 01:10:40,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> notices his black fingernails.  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS337
01:10:39,00 --> 01:10:47,50
He moves to the opponent beats him to the punch. As SOMEONE<Balthazar> slams into the circular-coil array, copper bands fasten around

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS338
01:10:46,00 --> 01:10:52,50
binding him. SOMEONE<Dave> morphs into SOMEONE<Drake>. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS339
01:10:52,00 --> 01:10:56,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> descends a staircase. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS340
01:11:11,00 --> 01:11:17,50
He flashes SOMEONE a snide smirk, then give 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS341
01:11:17,00 --> 01:11:24,50
SOMEONE appear and SOMEONE casts them across the lab to search for the SOMEONE 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS342
01:11:23,00 --> 01:11:28,50
around his right wrist, turning them 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS343
01:11:26,00 --> 01:11:35,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> guides his magical smoke across an equipment table. The gray gases reveal the contours of the SOMEONE<Grimhold>. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS344
01:11:35,00 --> 01:11:42,50
As SOMEONE<Drake> reaches for it, SOMEONE<Horvath> magically snatches it away. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS345
01:12:19,00 --> 01:12:23,50
Now, SOMEONE<Horvath> magically propels four throwing knives at SOMEONE<Balthazar>. The knives stop inches his face.  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS346
01:12:22,00 --> 01:12:28,50
SOMEONE<Dave> stands on the catwalk, using SOMEONE's<Merlin's> ring. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS350
01:12:55,00 --> 01:13:00,50
On SUV, SOMEONE glances back over his shoulder 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS351
01:13:23,00 --> 01:13:28,50
He shakes his ring. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS352
01:13:59,00 --> 01:14:03,50
Ferrari picks up speeds. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS353
01:14:05,00 --> 01:14:10,50
They pass Do Not Enter signs. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS354
01:14:20,00 --> 01:14:25,50
Struggling to see through the fog, 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS356
01:14:29,00 --> 01:14:37,50
the smoke clears a bit as the vehicles emerge from the tunnel and speed down the city streets. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS358
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:27,50
plummets and they off. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS360
01:16:29,00 --> 01:16:34,50
He climbs out of the Pinto. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS361
01:16:33,00 --> 01:16:40,50
Finding the garbage truck empty, SOMEONE<Balthazar> approaches a crowd of onlookers. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS362
01:16:42,00 --> 01:16:50,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> glances over his shoulder as he strides casually down the sidewalk. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS363
01:16:48,00 --> 01:16:58,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> touches a plain-faced woman, giving her SOMEONE's<Veronica's> likeness. SOMEONE<Balthazar> halts and their eyes meet. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS364
01:16:56,00 --> 01:17:03,50
As he stops her, she instantly changes back to the middle-aged New Yorker. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS365
01:17:06,00 --> 01:17:12,50
As she walks away, SOMEONE<Dave> approaches with Tank. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS366
01:17:21,00 --> 01:17:28,50
Later, SOMEONE<Balthazar> shows SOMEONE<Dave> more illustrations in the Incantus. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS368
01:17:44,00 --> 01:17:50,50
In the Middle Ages, SOMEONE<Veronica> lowers her cloak's hood. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS369
01:17:54,00 --> 01:17:59,50
She admires a necklace in a market. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS370
01:18:02,00 --> 01:18:07,50
SOMEONE<Dave> gawks, taking in SOMEONE's<Balthazar's> words. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS371
01:18:16,00 --> 01:18:23,50
He shows SOMEONE<Dave> the jewel-drop-pendant necklace from the market. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS372
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:27,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> steps away, leaving the Incantus open on SOMEONE's<Dave's> lap. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS373
01:18:53,00 --> 01:18:58,50
The apprentice shakes his head. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS374
01:19:03,00 --> 01:19:10,50
In SOMEONE's<Drake's> penthouse, the two SOMEONE<Morganians> eye the SOMEONE<Grimhold> on a glass desk. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS375
01:19:14,00 --> 01:19:18,50
It shows the Puritan girl. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS376
01:19:57,00 --> 01:20:01,50
He touches his walking stick to his neck. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS377
01:20:05,00 --> 01:20:19,50
He slides SOMEONE's<Drake's> ring onto his cane and touches the jewel knob to the SOMEONE<Grimhold>. A searing line slices the doll around the middle and Abigail's portrait burns. Now, SOMEONE<Becky> deejays at the radio station. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS378
01:20:24,00 --> 01:20:33,50
visitor glowers at her through a window. As SOMEONE<Becky> swivels in her chair, the girl suddenly appears beside her in Puritan attire. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS379
01:20:34,00 --> 01:20:39,50
Her eyes glow red and she smirks. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS380
01:20:49,00 --> 01:20:54,50
SOMEONE<Dave> gives him an earnest look. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS381
01:21:03,00 --> 01:21:09,50
He holds out his right fist, which bears SOMEONE's<Merlin's> ring. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS382
01:21:07,00 --> 01:21:12,50
They bump knuckles.  

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS383
01:21:15,00 --> 01:21:19,50
Meanwhile, he stalks toward her. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS384
01:21:19,00 --> 01:21:24,50
As they move out of view, light flashes. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS385
01:21:26,00 --> 01:21:33,50
Abigail is dead. He grabs her pentagram necklace. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS386
01:21:33,00 --> 01:21:38,50
Now, one of the double doors. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS388
01:21:39,00 --> 01:21:46,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> past a painting of SOMEONE<Drake> on a throne, attended by a panther and a gorgeous worshipful woman. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS389
01:21:48,00 --> 01:22:06,50
They split up. SOMEONE<Balthazar> peers through a doorway. We hover behind SOMEONE's<Drake's> glass desk as we watch him step into the opulent private office. He sees a map spread out on the desk, with a SOMEONE<Merlin> Circle drawn around one section labeled, Forbidden Domain. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS390
01:22:06,00 --> 01:22:10,50
As he crosses a black Persian carpet. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS391
01:22:10,00 --> 01:22:14,50
It grows thick and viscous. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS392
01:22:19,00 --> 01:22:25,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Dave> eyes two brass sculptures flanking a fireplace. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS393
01:22:23,00 --> 01:22:34,50
Looking around, he notices the SOMEONE<Grimhold> sitting on a small pedestal in front of the hearth. With a shrug, he crouches to it and reaches out, then hesitates. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS394
01:22:37,00 --> 01:22:46,50
He wags his finger shrewdly, then rubs his face. He abruptly grabs the SOMEONE<Grimhold> and looks around warily. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS395
01:22:46,00 --> 01:22:52,50
He sees a faded rendering of a female on its black surface. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS396
01:22:50,00 --> 01:22:57,50
He turns it around to find the likeness of SOMEONE's<Balthazar's> beloved. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS398
01:23:05,00 --> 01:23:08,50
SOMEONE gulps back 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS399
01:23:51,00 --> 01:24:02,50
a winch reels in the chain, pulling him free. Back in the foyer, SOMEONE<Dave> holds out SOMEONE's<Merlin's> ring and SOMEONE<Horvath> magically snatches it. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS400
01:24:02,00 --> 01:24:07,50
He offers up the SOMEONE<Grimhold>. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS401
01:24:05,00 --> 01:24:10,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> draws it to himself. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS402
01:24:09,00 --> 01:24:14,50
He releases SOMEONE<Becky>. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS404
01:24:30,00 --> 01:24:36,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> arrives and looks around. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS405
01:24:35,00 --> 01:24:41,50
He takes in SOMEONE's<Dave's> sorry expression, then shuts his eyes. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS406
01:24:51,00 --> 01:24:57,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> walks out to the terrace. His apprentice follows. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS407
01:25:14,00 --> 01:25:18,50
He hops up on the ledge. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS408
01:25:18,00 --> 01:25:24,50
The sorcerer turns, facing SOMEONE<Dave> and SOMEONE<Becky>. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS409
01:25:30,00 --> 01:25:37,50
He shuts his eyes, spreads his arms wide, and falls backward. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS410
01:25:40,00 --> 01:25:45,50
confronts SOMEONE<Dave> inside SOMEONE's<Drake's> penthouse. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS411
01:26:35,00 --> 01:26:40,50
Now, SOMEONE<Bennet> makes out with a young woman. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS412
01:26:46,00 --> 01:26:52,50
As his girlfriend steps out, he answers his cell. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS413
01:27:50,00 --> 01:27:54,50
Now in the lab, SOMEONE<Bennet> brings a box. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS414
01:27:57,00 --> 01:28:02,50
He hands SOMEONE<Dave> a wrapped cloth. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS415
01:28:00,00 --> 01:28:05,50
SOMEONE<Dave> reads an attached note. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS416
01:28:04,00 --> 01:28:12,50
He glances at SOMEONE<Becky>, then holds up the drop-pendant necklace and anxiously knits his brow. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS417
01:28:31,00 --> 01:28:43,50
Meanwhile, in Battery Park, SOMEONE<Horvath> mounts the steps to a tiered platform-like fountain. The spouting water ceases and he places the SOMEONE<Grimhold> on the highest tier. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS418
01:28:41,00 --> 01:28:47,50
He steps back, the gem on his cane glowing. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS419
01:28:49,00 --> 01:28:54,50
The nesting doll wavers. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS421
01:29:16,00 --> 01:29:22,50
She opens her exotic eyes to reveal glowing pupils. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS422
01:29:30,00 --> 01:29:35,50
SOMEONE<Horvath> picks up the empty SOMEONE<Grimhold>. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS423
01:29:36,00 --> 01:29:43,50
She closes her dark-lashed eyes and raises both arms. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS424
01:29:47,00 --> 01:29:51,50
SOMEONE creeps 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS425
01:30:18,00 --> 01:30:25,50
of energy streak off a dish atop a high rise as the car comes to a stop below portal. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS431
01:32:12,00 --> 01:32:16,50
On a rooftop. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS432
01:32:14,00 --> 01:32:23,50
SOMEONE<Becky> stares up at a tall antenna. A dish hangs near the top. Back at the park. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS433
01:32:39,00 --> 01:32:44,50
It chases the fleeing sorcerer. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS434
01:32:47,00 --> 01:32:51,50
it snorts, fogging the glass. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS435
01:32:50,00 --> 01:32:55,50
into the van and flings it aside. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS436
01:33:08,00 --> 01:33:16,50
SOMEONE<Becky> climbs toward the top of its framework and feebly kicks at the dish. Back at the park, 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS437
01:33:34,00 --> 01:33:38,50
gram containing arcane rune 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS438
01:33:47,00 --> 01:33:53,50
In an overgrown cemetery, two of the smoke trails meet and electrocutes the evil magician. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS441
01:34:26,00 --> 01:34:31,50
Now, clouds of black darken the sky above. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS442
01:34:29,00 --> 01:34:35,50
Smoke shoots into an ancient ossuary piled with human 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS443
01:34:38,00 --> 01:34:43,50
SOMEONE's<Veronica's> form presides over the flaming fountain. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS446
01:34:58,00 --> 01:35:03,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> rushes forward and cradles her fallen form. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS447
01:35:07,00 --> 01:35:25,50
As he tenderly touches SOMEONE's<Veronica's> forehead, his ring glows green. He then moves his fingers to his own forehead. As he goes back and forth between the two, streaks of light fly out of SOMEONE's<Veronica's> face and into his own. He kisses her, sucking a fine cloud of dust into his nose and SOMEONE's<Morgana's> face, briefly appears in the particle stream. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS449
01:35:27,00 --> 01:35:32,50
She become alive as the last of it gets absorbed. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS450
01:35:29,00 --> 01:35:36,50
SOMEONE's<Veronica's> eyelids flutter open. She gazes up at her wincing lover. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS451
01:35:40,00 --> 01:35:47,50
He staggers to his feet and tosses the SOMEONE<Grimhold> to SOMEONE<Dave>. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS452
01:35:53,00 --> 01:35:58,50
His eyes transform. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS453
01:35:56,00 --> 01:36:04,50
His face seizes and he crumples to his knees. As his head tips back, the 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS454
01:36:06,00 --> 01:36:11,50
SOMEONE<Balthazar> collapses onto the ground. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS455
01:36:11,00 --> 01:36:15,50
materializes from the smoky cloud. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS456
01:36:44,00 --> 01:36:50,50
knocks him off his feet and sends him tumbling. SOMEONE<Dave> stares at him worriedly, then faces

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS457
01:36:55,00 --> 01:37:01,50
As he fires them, the shoot past SOMEONE<Morgana> and hit a power shed. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS458
01:37:11,00 --> 01:37:15,50
The bolts pass through 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS459
01:37:19,00 --> 01:37:24,50
She melds herself back together. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS460
01:37:29,00 --> 01:37:33,50
SOMEONE cowers as their burst impacts push him backward. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS462
01:37:52,00 --> 01:37:56,50
One cable reaches a lamppost.

cable twines up a lamp. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS464
01:38:20,00 --> 01:38:28,50
It arcs off the lamppost like Tesla coils and strikes SOMEONE<Morgana>. An aerial view shows plasma flick. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS465
01:38:27,00 --> 01:38:34,50
SOMEONE<Dave> shoots lightning from his hands. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS467
01:38:53,00 --> 01:39:02,50
it vanishes in a puff. SOMEONE<Dave> slumps weakly as the wind blows away the last bits of dust. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS468
01:39:04,00 --> 01:39:15,50
He finds SOMEONE<Veronica> hunched over the fallen sorcerer. She soberly looks up at the apprentice, her raven-black hair whipping in the wind. SOMEONE<Dave> shakes his head. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS469
01:39:16,00 --> 01:39:21,50
He tearfully clenches his jaw. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS470
01:39:36,00 --> 01:39:57,50
Taking a seat on one of the steps to the fountain, he thoughtfully raises his hands, then lets them flop back down. SOMEONE<Veronica> leans close to SOMEONE<Balthazar>, her face hovering inches from his, and tenderly strokes his cheek. Our view rises about the grieving Merlinians. SOMEONE<Dave> resolutely tightens his lips. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS471
01:39:55,00 --> 01:40:00,50
He strides forward. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS472
01:40:06,00 --> 01:40:12,50
As he throws up his hands, a ring of fire suddenly appears around SOMEONE. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS473
01:40:10,00 --> 01:40:15,50
SOMEONE<Veronica> smiles. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS476
01:40:30,00 --> 01:40:44,50
He defeatedly hangs his head. One of his hands clenches into a fist, while the other remains on SOMEONE's<Balthazar's> chest. The ring of fire flickers feebly around them. SOMEONE<Veronica> looks on in anguish as SOMEONE<Dave> shakes his head. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS477
01:40:47,00 --> 01:40:53,50
She clutches her hands to her mouth. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS478
01:41:04,00 --> 01:41:11,50
SOMEONE<Dave> wraps the necklace around SOMEONE's<Balthazar's> hand and squeezes his fist. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS479
01:41:12,00 --> 01:41:38,50
SOMEONE<Veronica> hurries into the circle and helps her lover to his feet. SOMEONE<Dave> steps away as they embrace and share a tender kiss. SOMEONE<Veronica> cups the back of SOMEONE's<Balthazar's> head in her hand. As he raises the necklace, she sweeps her hair out of the way, allowing him to fasten it around her neck. SOMEONE<Dave> ambles to the park gate and finds SOMEONE's<Horvath's> hat lying on the sidewalk. He picks it up. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS480
01:41:37,00 --> 01:41:43,50
SOMEONE<Becky> sprints around a corner and seizes him in a hug. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS481
01:41:53,00 --> 01:42:00,50
They lock lips in a breathless kiss. SOMEONE<Becky> pulls away with a smile. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS482
01:42:02,00 --> 01:42:07,50
SOMEONE<Dave> kisses her again. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS483
01:42:11,00 --> 01:42:15,50
The steel eagle lands on the ground. 

SORCERERS_APPRENTICE_DVS484
01:42:21,00 --> 01:42:28,50
eagle soars among the tops of skyscrapers, with SOMEONE<Dave> and SOMEONE<Becky> riding on its back.
