SUPER_8_DVS102
00:17:23,00 --> 00:17:31,50

00:17:29,00 --> 00:17:35,50
The speeding train bucks and twists as cars detach and crash. 

SUPER_8_DVS104
00:17:32,00 --> 00:17:39,50
As the rear of the train comes apart, SOMEONE<Joe>, SOMEONE<Charles>, and SOMEONE<Cary> turn back. SOMEONE<Alice> stands rooted.

One train car slams into the back of a tanker car launching the cylindrical tank into the sky. 

SUPER_8_DVS113
00:18:15,00 --> 00:18:21,50

SUPER_8_DVS125
00:19:18,00 --> 00:19:23,50
Lying on its side the camera continues to run.

SUPER_8_DVS130
00:19:50,00 --> 00:19:55,50
Holding one hand over his heart Preston turns. 

SUPER_8_DVS131
00:19:55,00 --> 00:20:00,50
SOMEONE<Martin> gives a thumbs up as he vomits.

SUPER_8_DVS204
00:35:33,00 --> 00:35:39,50
Inside, the young clerk reads while listening through headphones to a portable cassette player. 

SUPER_8_DVS205
00:35:40,00 --> 00:35:46,50

SUPER_8_DVS209
00:36:03,00 --> 00:36:09,50
At the pump, he leans against his car as he fills it with gas. 

SUPER_8_DVS210
00:36:10,00 --> 00:36:17,50
The sheriff lifts his head and gazes around himself then takes a few steps toward the road. 

SUPER_8_DVS211
00:36:21,00 --> 00:36:27,50
A pack of about a half a dozen dogs of mixed breeds races past the sheriff. 

SUPER_8_DVS212
00:36:28,00 --> 00:36:33,50
He places his hands on his hips as glances back into the darkness. 

SUPER_8_DVS213
00:36:37,00 --> 00:36:44,50
The sheriff leaps as the lights on his cruiser flash. He reaches into the car and turns off the power. 

SUPER_8_DVS214
00:36:48,00 --> 00:36:55,50
The sheriff turns toward a dumpster standing beside the gas station. Placing one hand on his gun he creeps toward it. 

SUPER_8_DVS216
00:37:02,00 --> 00:37:11,50
He draws his weapon as the dumpster slides across the parking lot. Inside, SOMEONE<Breen> bobs his head as he listens through his headphones.

SUPER_8_DVS233
00:39:50,00 --> 00:39:54,50
SOMEONE<Joe> stares at her as she creeps toward him. 

SUPER_8_DVS234
00:40:01,00 --> 00:40:06,50
Jerking, she holds up her hands and steps closer. 

SUPER_8_DVS236

SUPER_8_DVS489
01:24:01,00 --> 01:24:07,50
Inside the bus, SOMEONE<Nelec> fires at the creature as it approaches. 

SUPER_8_DVS491
01:24:09,00 --> 01:24:17,50
SOMEONE<Nelec> backs up toward the holding cell door, he shakes the rifle as it runs out of ammunition. 

SUPER_8_DVS492
01:24:14,00 --> 01:24:20,50
SOMEONE<Nelec> tosses the gun aside and smiles briefly as the creature pauses. 

SUPER_8_DVS493
01:24:18,00 --> 01:24:24,50
The creature lunges toward SOMEONE<Nelec> pressing him against the cell door. 

SUPER_8_DVS494
01:24:23,00 --> 01:24:29,50
Outside, the boys watches the creature climbs out of the bus and runs off.

01:24:43,00 --> 01:24:47,50
SOMEONE<Jack> leads Mr. SOMEONE<Dainard> away. 

SUPER_8_DVS497
01:24:49,00 --> 01:24:56,50
Kneeling on the road near the bus SOMEONE<Joe> pulls the locket necklace from SOMEONE's<Overmyer's> jacket pocket.

SUPER_8_DVS502
01:25:29,00 --> 01:25:33,50

01:25:44,00 --> 01:25:52,50
Ahead, an armored tank fires at the car SOMEONE<Joe> swerves into a driveway as the tank passes behind them. 

SUPER_8_DVS505
01:26:01,00 --> 01:26:10,50
More tanks drive down the street and fire their guns. Leaving SOMEONE<Donny> in the car the boys jump out and run through a yard and down a path. 

SUPER_8_DVS506
01:26:15,00 --> 01:26:21,50
On the street, a helmeted soldier talks into a transceiver. 

SUPER_8_DVS507
01:26:26,00 --> 01:26:33,50
A missile explodes nearby. A few blocks away, the boys run past houses and across more lawns. 

SUPER_8_DVS509
01:26:33,00 --> 01:26:38,50
They jumped over a chain fence and into a backyard. 

SUPER_8_DVS510
01:26:38,00 --> 01:26:45,50
As they run through a back gate they stop as an exploding tank tumbles across the ground toward them. 

SUPER_8_DVS511
01:26:45,00 --> 01:26:53,50

SUPER_8_DVS524
01:28:26,00 --> 01:28:34,50
Across town, they run into the cemetery and over to the caretaker's shed which has several sets of doors. 

SUPER_8_DVS525
01:28:40,00 --> 01:28:45,50
They pull up on one door which doesn't budge. 

SUPER_8_DVS526
01:28:43,00 --> 01:28:47,50
They move to another door. 

SUPER_8_DVS527
01:28:47,00 --> 01:28:53,50

SUPER_8_DVS528
01:29:01,00 --> 01:29:06,50
They bust the doors open revealing a huge hole in the ground. 

SUPER_8_DVS529
01:29:05,00 --> 01:29:11,50
They gaze into the hole which leads straight down.

SUPER_8_DVS540
01:30:32,00 --> 01:30:38,50
SOMEONE<Joe> lights another sparkler and glances around at several tunnels. 

SUPER_8_DVS541
01:30:43,00 --> 01:30:47,50
SOMEONE<Joe> turns. 

SUPER_8_DVS542
01:30:48,00 --> 01:30:56,50
SOMEONE<Cary> follows SOMEONE<Joe> through a tunnel they pass underneath another huge hole on the floor of a house where a lamp flickers. 

SUPER_8_DVS543
01:30:58,00 --> 01:31:04,50
SOMEONE<Joe> and SOMEONE<Cary> approach the opening to a huge underground chamber. 

SUPER_8_DVS544
01:31:13,00 --> 01:31:20,50
They gaze into the chamber which is filled to electric wiring, other equipment and batteries. 

SUPER_8_DVS545
01:31:32,00 --> 01:31:40,50
As they move closer SOMEONE<Cary> turns and finds himself face-to-face with Sheriff Pruit who hangs upside down. 

SUPER_8_DVS546
01:31:41,00 --> 01:31:47,50
SOMEONE<Joe> clamps his hand over SOMEONE's<Cary's> mouth and pulls him behind a rock. 

SUPER_8_DVS547
01:31:47,00 --> 01:31:52,50
Dozens of bodies hang upside down in the chamber. 

SUPER_8_DVS548
01:31:55,00 --> 01:32:00,50
SOMEONE<Joe> studies the bodies' faces. 

SUPER_8_DVS549
01:32:08,00 --> 01:32:13,50
SOMEONE's<Joe's> eyes widened, SOMEONE's<Cary's> jaw drops. 

SUPER_8_DVS550
01:32:13,00 --> 01:32:20,50
Inside the chamber, the creature works on a machine while eating a human leg. 

SUPER_8_DVS551
01:32:22,00 --> 01:32:27,50

SUPER_8_DVS554
01:33:04,00 --> 01:33:10,50

SUPER_8_DVS555
01:33:08,00 --> 01:33:14,50
He glances up as the creature pulls down a woman wearing hair rollers. 

SUPER_8_DVS556
01:33:12,00 --> 01:33:18,50

SOMEONE<Cary> takes out a cigarette lighter and tries to ignite it. 

SUPER_8_DVS558
01:33:22,00 --> 01:33:29,50
From across the chamber, SOMEONE<Joe> keeps an eye on SOMEONE<Cary> who continues to strike the lighter.

01:33:32,00 --> 01:33:36,50
The creature pulls SOMEONE<Alice> down. 

SUPER_8_DVS560
01:33:42,00 --> 01:33:46,50
SOMEONE<Cary> ignites the lighter. 

SUPER_8_DVS561
01:33:45,00 --> 01:33:52,50
He lights the fuse on a chain of fireworks, grabs his backpack, and runs off. 

SUPER_8_DVS564
01:33:59,00 --> 01:34:05,50
The creature leaves SOMEONE<Alice> on the ground and investigates. 

SUPER_8_DVS565

SOMEONE<Alice> opens her eyes. 

SUPER_8_DVS568
01:34:31,00 --> 01:34:35,50
She sits up. 

SUPER_8_DVS569
01:34:39,00 --> 01:34:44,50

SUPER_8_DVS573
01:35:18,00 --> 01:35:25,50
Elsewhere, the creature moves through a tunnel as the light from fireworks flickers on the walls. 

SUPER_8_DVS574
01:35:22,00 --> 01:35:28,50
SOMEONE<Cary> darts through the tunnel and glances back at the creature. 

SUPER_8_DVS575
01:35:25,00 --> 01:35:31,50
Back in the large chamber, Sheriff SOMEONE<Pruit> shines a flashlight.

01:35:33,00 --> 01:35:42,50
SOMEONE<Joe>, SOMEONE<Alice>, and Tina the woman wearing rollers followed the sheriff past the creatures collection of wires and other equipment then into a tunnel.

SUPER_8_DVS581
01:36:03,00 --> 01:36:07,50
SOMEONE<Cary> turns and runs. 

SUPER_8_DVS582
01:36:04,00 --> 01:36:10,50
SOMEONE<Joe> and SOMEONE<Alice> follow close to SOMEONE<Cary> while Tina lags behind. 

SUPER_8_DVS583
01:36:07,00 --> 01:36:14,50
The creature chases them through the tunnel, grabs Tina, and throws her aside. 

SUPER_8_DVS584
01:36:15,00 --> 01:36:20,50
Reaching a dead end they turn and gazed down the empty tunnel. 

SUPER_8_DVS585
01:36:20,00 --> 01:36:24,50
The creature appears around the corner. 

SUPER_8_DVS586
01:36:25,00 --> 01:36:30,50
SOMEONE<Cary> and SOMEONE<Alice> clammer against the tunnel wall. 

SUPER_8_DVS587
01:36:27,00 --> 01:36:32,50
SOMEONE<Joe> stands still and stares at the creature. 

SUPER_8_DVS588
01:36:34,00 --> 01:36:40,50
The creature lurches closer and closer toward the three children. 

SUPER_8_DVS589
01:36:42,00 --> 01:36:50,50
Cowering beside SOMEONE<Cary>, SOMEONE<Alice> frowns as she glances from the creature to SOMEONE<Joe> who marches toward the creature. 

SUPER_8_DVS590
01:36:47,00 --> 01:36:51,50
SOMEONE<Cary> turns to SOMEONE<Alice>. 

SUPER_8_DVS591
01:36:52,00 --> 01:36:57,50
SOMEONE<Joe> gazes up at the creature. 

SUPER_8_DVS592
01:36:58,00 --> 01:37:02,50
The creature picks up SOMEONE<Joe>. 

SUPER_8_DVS593
01:37:04,00 --> 01:37:10,50
The creature lifts SOMEONE<Joe> close to its own face and studies him. 

SUPER_8_DVS594
01:37:32,00 --> 01:37:37,50
SOMEONE's<Joe's> hair moves as the creature breathes on him. 

SUPER_8_DVS595
01:37:34,00 --> 01:37:40,50
A covering on the creatures eyes slides upward. 

SUPER_8_DVS596
01:37:40,00 --> 01:37:44,50
The creature stares at SOMEONE<Joe>. 

SUPER_8_DVS597
01:37:45,00 --> 01:37:50,50
Behind the creature a machine in the chamber switches on. 

SUPER_8_DVS598
01:37:54,00 --> 01:37:59,50
The creature glances away then turns back to SOMEONE<Joe>. 

SUPER_8_DVS599
01:38:05,00 --> 01:38:12,50
The creature lowers SOMEONE<Joe> to the ground, glances at the children, then speeds back to the chamber. 

SUPER_8_DVS600
01:38:12,00 --> 01:38:16,50
SOMEONE<Cary> steps toward SOMEONE<Joe>. 

SUPER_8_DVS601
01:38:18,00 --> 01:38:25,50
Later above ground, the children run along a street into the center of town. 

SUPER_8_DVS602
01:38:24,00 --> 01:38:30,50
On a corner, a metal trash can shakes then flies off toward the water tower. 

SUPER_8_DVS603
01:38:30,00 --> 01:38:39,50
The children walk past armed soldiers who stare skyward as various metal objects - large and small - fly toward the tower. 

SUPER_8_DVS604
01:38:42,00 --> 01:38:49,50
The windows of the camera shop shatter as cameras and other metal objects fly out. 

SUPER_8_DVS605
01:38:48,00 --> 01:38:53,50
A soldier's dog tag rips of his neck. 

SUPER_8_DVS606
01:38:51,00 --> 01:38:58,50
Sliding along the street as if ice skating, another soldier clings to his rifle as it flies toward the tower. 

SUPER_8_DVS607
01:38:56,00 --> 01:39:02,50
The soldier rises then let's go of his gun and falls to the ground. 

SUPER_8_DVS608
01:38:59,00 --> 01:39:07,50
In the car lot, car headlights flashed. The doors on a cargo truck containing containers of cubes burst open. 

SUPER_8_DVS609
01:39:08,00 --> 01:39:13,50
The cubes fly out and sail into the sky. 

SUPER_8_DVS610
01:39:14,00 --> 01:39:22,50
Lying on the ground, SOMEONE<Joe>, SOMEONE<Alice>, and SOMEONE<Cary> watch as the cubes assemble in the sky. 

SUPER_8_DVS611
01:39:29,00 --> 01:39:37,50
Everyone stands and stares into the sky as the cubes come together forming parts of the creature's ship. 

SUPER_8_DVS612
01:39:42,00 --> 01:39:47,50
The ship's spotlights shine down on the street. 

SUPER_8_DVS613
01:39:50,00 --> 01:39:57,50
The ship nears completion as cubes rise from different trucks throughout town. 

SUPER_8_DVS614
01:39:59,00 --> 01:40:05,50
SOMEONE<Joe> watches as SOMEONE<Jack> gets out and peers up at the forming ship. 

SUPER_8_DVS615
01:40:07,00 --> 01:40:14,50
SOMEONE<Jack> and SOMEONE<Dainard> walk together toward SOMEONE<Joe> and SOMEONE<Alice> who exchange glances. 

SUPER_8_DVS616
01:40:20,00 --> 01:40:27,50
SOMEONE hurries up to SOMEONE, places his hands on the sides of his son's face. 

SUPER_8_DVS618
01:40:39,00 --> 01:40:44,50
He hugs him, SOMEONE shuckles over to SOMEONE. 

SUPER_8_DVS619
01:40:48,00 --> 01:40:53,50
Her eyes filled with tears as she hugs her father. 

SUPER_8_DVS620
01:40:54,00 --> 01:41:00,50
Still hugging his own father SOMEONE<Joe> gazes up at the ship. 

SUPER_8_DVS621
01:41:00,00 --> 01:41:06,50
The soldiers watch the fully formed ship as it prepares to fly away. 

SUPER_8_DVS622
01:41:08,00 --> 01:41:14,50
SOMEONE<Joe> closes his eyes as he and SOMEONE<Jack> embrace. 

SUPER_8_DVS623
01:41:14,00 --> 01:41:19,50
SOMEONE<Joe> opens his eyes and steps back. 

SUPER_8_DVS624
01:41:17,00 --> 01:41:22,50
The locket necklace rises from his pocket. 

SUPER_8_DVS625
01:41:19,00 --> 01:41:25,50
SOMEONE<Joe> grips the necklace chain as the locket moves toward the ship. 

SUPER_8_DVS626
01:41:32,00 --> 01:41:40,50
SOMEONE<Joe> stares at the locket which opens revealing a photograph of SOMEONE's<Joe's> brunette mother holding SOMEONE<Joe> as a baby. 

SUPER_8_DVS627
01:41:42,00 --> 01:41:47,50
SOMEONE<Joe> cries as he studies the picture. 

SUPER_8_DVS628
01:41:45,00 --> 01:41:50,50
SOMEONE<Jack> places one hand on SOMEONE's<Joe's> shoulder. 

SUPER_8_DVS629
01:41:48,00 --> 01:41:53,50
SOMEONE lets go of the chain, 

SUPER_8_DVS630
01:41:50,00 --> 01:41:55,50
The locket sails up toward the tower. 

SUPER_8_DVS631
01:42:01,00 --> 01:42:05,50
Loaded with metallic objects 

SUPER_8_DVS632
01:42:03,00 --> 01:42:07,50
the water tower implodes. 

SUPER_8_DVS633
01:42:05,00 --> 01:42:10,50
Water showers down on the people in the street. 

SUPER_8_DVS634
01:42:11,00 --> 01:42:17,50
Parts of the water tower's metal frame fall to the street. 

SUPER_8_DVS635
01:42:29,00 --> 01:42:35,50
The creature climbs up the tower and into the ship which flies away. 

SUPER_8_DVS636
01:42:41,00 --> 01:42:48,50
On a sidewalk, SOMEONE<Martin> hobbles along and holds onto SOMEONE<Charles> as they gaze up at the ship. 

SUPER_8_DVS637
01:42:46,00 --> 01:42:50,50
In his car, SOMEONE<Donny> stirs. 

SUPER_8_DVS638
01:42:52,00 --> 01:42:58,50
SOMEONE<Joe> and SOMEONE<Alice> stand side by side and watch the ship fly off.
