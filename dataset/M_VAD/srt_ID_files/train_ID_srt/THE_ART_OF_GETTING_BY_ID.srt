THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS18
00:02:56,00 --> 00:03:05,50
In a classroom the teenage boy draws in his textbook, sketching a mustached man with a worried face. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS19
00:03:03,00 --> 00:03:11,50
As a matronly teacher makes her way down an aisle other students hand her their assignments. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS20
00:03:10,00 --> 00:03:18,50
The young artist sits concentrating, shading a shirt collar under the worried face. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS21
00:03:59,00 --> 00:04:19,50
SOMEONE<George> collects his things and heads out. Now outside, he cuts across a grove of leafless trees beside a river. He stops and gazes ahead. He stands alone in his dark coat before a backdrop of buildings and a stonewall. Now he enters the school office where an assistant does paperwork. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS22
00:04:26,00 --> 00:04:32,50
A man behind a window beckons SOMEONE<George> sternly. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS23
00:04:30,00 --> 00:04:37,50
In the Principal's office the young man slings his backpack to the floor. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS24
00:05:17,00 --> 00:05:22,50
SOMEONE<George> drops his gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS25
00:05:51,00 --> 00:05:57,50
SOMEONE<Bill> gazes a scant at the departing student. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS26
00:05:55,00 --> 00:06:14,50
Collecting his book bag, SOMEONE<George> heads off. Now he emerges from a stairwell unto the school roof. With parted lips he stares through the chain linked fence toward a highway and a distant bridge spanning the nearby river. Glancing over his shoulder, he spots an onlooker across the rooftop. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS27
00:06:12,00 --> 00:06:21,50
One of the three students from the lunchroom, a blond girl, exhales smoke and meets his gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS28
00:06:20,00 --> 00:06:27,50
As SOMEONE<George> faintly smiles, the stairwell door opens. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS29
00:06:24,00 --> 00:06:30,50
The blond tosses her cigarette through the fence. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS30
00:06:28,00 --> 00:06:33,50
SOMEONE<George> quickly takes out a cigarette. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS31
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:37,50
A dark haired faculty member arrives. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS32
00:06:42,00 --> 00:06:48,50
The blond mouths thank you as she leaves. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS33
00:06:47,00 --> 00:07:07,50
Later. Entering a stylish apartment, SOMEONE<George> walks a hall to a spacious living room with a comfy sitting area and a baby grand piano. In the kitchen he pours a bowl of cereal. A middle-aged woman enters and sets a briefcase on the table. SOMEONE<George> averts his gaze from hers as he gets milk from the fridge. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS34
00:07:54,00 --> 00:08:05,50
He takes his leave. Now seated at a white canvas in school he draws in pencil. Charcoal portraits decorate the walls. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS35
00:08:04,00 --> 00:08:11,50
A gray haired bearded instructor approaches glowering. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS36
00:08:15,00 --> 00:08:23,50
His drawing shows a fist punching the teeth out of the bearded teacher's grotesque caricature. SOMEONE<Harris> punches him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS38
00:08:50,00 --> 00:09:02,50
Other art students glance up from their work. Now, SOMEONE<George> exits the building. As the blond girl tries to walk abreast of him, SOMEONE<George> ignores her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS39
00:09:02,00 --> 00:09:07,50
She catches up on the sidewalk. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS40
00:09:28,00 --> 00:09:34,50
On a nearby court boys shoot baskets. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS41
00:10:13,00 --> 00:10:19,50
SOMEONE<Sally> bites her lip thoughtfully. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS42
00:10:27,00 --> 00:10:31,50
SOMEONE glares as she spots 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS43
00:10:28,00 --> 00:10:34,50
a couple canoodling on a brown stone stairway. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS44
00:10:34,00 --> 00:10:46,50
SOMEONE<Clad> in a negligee and robe, the woman kisses a younger man, then flirtatiously touches his coat lapel. Her gaze follows as he makes his way past SOMEONE<Sally> and SOMEONE<George>. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS45
00:10:46,00 --> 00:10:53,50
SOMEONE's<Sally's> mother heads indoors. SOMEONE<George> stares, transfixed. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS46
00:10:52,00 --> 00:11:00,50
The kids enter a well-appointed dining area where SOMEONE's<Sally's> mom holds a drink. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS47
00:11:16,00 --> 00:11:21,50
Now, the three share drinks on a patio. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS48
00:11:35,00 --> 00:11:42,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Howe> touches SOMEONE's<George’s> leg. He jolts spilling his beer. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS49
00:11:39,00 --> 00:11:44,50
SOMEONE<Sally> rolls her eyes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS50
00:11:50,00 --> 00:11:55,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Howe> steps away. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS51
00:12:34,00 --> 00:12:40,50
SOMEONE<George> grins, his eyes darting. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS52
00:12:47,00 --> 00:12:54,50
SOMEONE<George> rises, smiling. SOMEONE's<Sally's> gaze meet his expectantly

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS53
00:12:51,00 --> 00:12:58,50
and she offers a demure smile. SOMEONE<George> returns a winsome shrug. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS54
00:12:59,00 --> 00:13:04,50
He lingers a moment then heads inside. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS55
00:13:03,00 --> 00:13:09,50
SOMEONE<Sally> leans forward, resting her head on her hand. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS56
00:13:09,00 --> 00:13:17,50
Now, leafless trees silhouette the dusky horizon where SOMEONE<George> stops and gazes off. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS57
00:13:18,00 --> 00:13:26,50
He opens the door to his dimly lit apartment. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS58
00:13:23,00 --> 00:13:33,50
He flicks a light switch, then another with no effect. Candles illuminate the living room and dining area.  

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS59
00:13:53,00 --> 00:13:58,50
At the table, SOMEONE's<George's> mother shares a meal with a middle aged man. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS61
00:14:15,00 --> 00:14:22,50
Later on a balcony, he gazes toward the twinkling Manhattan skyline. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS62
00:14:20,00 --> 00:14:27,50
At school a pretty teacher in bookish glasses leads a class. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS63
00:14:24,00 --> 00:14:30,50
SOMEONE<George> glances at SOMEONE<Sally> in the desk to his right. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS64
00:14:33,00 --> 00:14:39,50
SOMEONE<George> adds detail to a doodle die ball. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS65
00:14:42,00 --> 00:14:47,50
He looks up. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS66
00:14:57,00 --> 00:15:03,50
SOMEONE<George> absent-mindedly thumbs the pages of a book. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS67
00:15:02,00 --> 00:15:07,50
SOMEONE<Sally> grins. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS68
00:15:36,00 --> 00:15:42,50
Under the teacher's beaming gaze he fidgets. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS69
00:15:42,00 --> 00:15:56,50
He shoots a glance at SOMEONE<Sally>. Now he crosses the lunchroom where SOMEONE<Sally> sits with her two friends, a dark haired girl and a preppy guy. SOMEONE<Sally> catches his eye as SOMEONE<George> starts to take a seat at an empty table. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS70
00:15:55,00 --> 00:16:00,50
He approaches, tray in hand. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS71
00:16:27,00 --> 00:16:31,50
SOMEONE<George> hands him a textbook. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS72
00:16:28,00 --> 00:16:39,50
SOMEONE<Will> scans the pages revealing severe black and white renderings of faces, eyes and mouths. Some punctuated with red. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS73
00:16:54,00 --> 00:16:59,50
SOMEONE<George> nods tentatively. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS74
00:16:59,00 --> 00:17:12,50
Now in his bedroom, SOMEONE<George> sits at a desk. He leans over a sketchbook with a pen and adds to a drawing which includes a horned Cyclops wearing a party hat. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS75
00:17:11,00 --> 00:17:17,50
SOMEONE<George> covers his sketch with homework as SOMEONE<Jack> enters. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS76
00:17:24,00 --> 00:17:39,50
As SOMEONE<George> pretends to resume his homework, a pleased SOMEONE<Jack> steps out. The teen sticks the assignment into a textbook, then returns to his drawing. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS77
00:17:37,00 --> 00:17:46,50
He adds shoulders to a grimacing demon within a starburst design. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS78
00:17:44,00 --> 00:17:49,50
The next day he arrives at school and opens the doors which have been decorated with paper snowflakes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS79
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:05,50
At lunch. His drawing shows the demon punching through the page. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS80
00:18:10,00 --> 00:18:20,50
He cracks a smile. Now Asian lettering adorns shops in Chinatown. SOMEONE<George> and SOMEONE<Sally> walk up from a Subway station. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS81
00:18:43,00 --> 00:18:53,50
Later they eat from takeout containers. Now a film shows a man and boy descending a spiral staircase on the Eiffel Tower. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS82
00:18:51,00 --> 00:19:01,50
Subtitles. Tell me why aren't you married? I haven't found my dream girl. In the movie theater, SOMEONE<George> glances at SOMEONE<Sally> who wears glasses. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS83
00:18:59,00 --> 00:19:07,50
Do you like me? Of course not. A Marquee reads Zazie Dans le Metro. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS84
00:19:28,00 --> 00:19:33,50
Across the street SOMEONE<Jack> walks alone. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS86
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:37,50
SOMEONE<George> and SOMEONE<Sally> round a corner and spy on him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS87
00:19:48,00 --> 00:20:02,50
Wearing his trench coat SOMEONE<Jack> slowly ambles along with a briefcase in hand. SOMEONE<George> and SOMEONE<Sally> peer around the nose of a truck and watch him enter a coffee shop called, The Cup & Saucer. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS88
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:06,50
SOMEONE<Jack> takes a seat at a window. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS89
00:20:08,00 --> 00:20:13,50
SOMEONE<George> watches his stepfather do paperwork. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS90
00:20:11,00 --> 00:20:19,50
Now at school, as the teen heads up a stairwell the Principal blocks his path. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS91
00:20:48,00 --> 00:20:53,50
He sips from a mug. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS92
00:21:21,00 --> 00:21:34,50
The principal heads off. Now a banner hangs over the school entrance, Career Fair. SOMEONE<George> steps outside with his shirt tucked in and a nametag on his chest. He looks around. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS93
00:21:33,00 --> 00:21:46,50
He spots a scruffy looking guy standing across the street then heads in his direction. With his back turned to the approaching student the unshaven man hunches over to light a cigarette. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS95
00:22:28,00 --> 00:22:33,50
A monitor shows an abstract painting. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS96
00:22:57,00 --> 00:23:02,50
Later, SOMEONE<Dustin> and SOMEONE<George> sit on a boulder. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS97
00:23:12,00 --> 00:23:19,50
SOMEONE<George> musses up his own hair. SOMEONE<Dustin> sits back and folds his arms. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS98
00:23:33,00 --> 00:23:40,50
Holding a coffee with both hands, SOMEONE<George> stares at him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS99
00:23:56,00 --> 00:24:04,50
SOMEONE<George> glances at his coffee. Now, he and SOMEONE<Sally> stroll along a sidewalk. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS100
00:24:18,00 --> 00:24:25,50
SOMEONE<Sally> smirks, then shakes her head and continues on alone. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS101
00:24:23,00 --> 00:24:32,50
Watching her go, SOMEONE<George> smiles to himself. About 50 yards away SOMEONE<Sally> glances back. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS102
00:24:29,00 --> 00:24:46,50
Now traffic passes several evergreens adorned with lights. The image dissolves to the trees at night as more traffic crawls by. On another day, a taxi drives over the Manhattan Bridge. Riding in the back seat, SOMEONE<George> looks at SOMEONE<Sally> who sits beside him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS103
00:24:43,00 --> 00:24:48,50
She glances out his window. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS104
00:24:48,00 --> 00:24:56,50
SOMEONE<George> sits up following her gaze past a railing to a cluster of industrial brick buildings. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS105
00:24:54,00 --> 00:25:03,50
An American flag waves atop a pillar on the distant Brooklyn Bridge. SOMEONE<George> smiles to himself. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS106
00:25:00,00 --> 00:25:05,50
Now he presses a doorbell. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS107
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:11,50
The teens wait outside a blue building. SOMEONE<Dustin> shoves the door open. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS108
00:25:09,00 --> 00:25:14,50
Seeing SOMEONE<Sally> with SOMEONE<George>, he giggles. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS109
00:25:17,00 --> 00:25:22,50
He gestures inside. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS110
00:25:19,00 --> 00:25:26,50
SOMEONE<Sally> and SOMEONE<George> enter. SOMEONE<Dustin> yanks the door shut behind them. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS111
00:25:24,00 --> 00:25:30,50
Inside his studio they look over various paintings. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS112
00:25:36,00 --> 00:25:40,50
He points to one. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS113
00:25:39,00 --> 00:25:44,50
SOMEONE<George> wanders off alone. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS114
00:26:02,00 --> 00:26:08,50
Later, SOMEONE<Dustin> looks over SOMEONE's<George's> sketchbook. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS115
00:26:38,00 --> 00:26:44,50
He glances at SOMEONE<Sally> who sits in the next room. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS116
00:26:48,00 --> 00:26:53,50
SOMEONE<George> looks at her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS117
00:26:51,00 --> 00:26:56,50
He peers out the window. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS118
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:24,50
He returns his attention to the sketchbook. SOMEONE<George> shifts his gaze. That night he and SOMEONE<Sally> ride back in a cab. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS119
00:27:44,00 --> 00:27:56,50
SOMEONE<Sally> rolls her eyes curiously then folds her legs. She and SOMEONE<George> each look out their windows. Traffic drives past the median lined with Christmas trees. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS120
00:27:53,00 --> 00:27:57,50
Now at dinner. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS121
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:04,50
SOMEONE<George> text messages. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS122
00:28:05,00 --> 00:28:18,50
Later in his room, he lies on his bed with an art book. He flips back several pages and studies a red hued painting of a figure standing under bare trees before a distant building. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS123
00:28:20,00 --> 00:28:28,50
Turning to the next page he studies an oil painting of a woman in a ruffled dress facing a mirror. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS124
00:28:29,00 --> 00:28:40,50
He turns the page again and studies a portrait of a sickly somber faced boy. The transfixed teen focuses on the boy's dark eyes, 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS125
00:28:37,00 --> 00:28:44,50
which seem to stair back at him. Shades of peach represent the subject's 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS126
00:28:41,00 --> 00:28:48,50
fair skin. Now in a gallery, patrons gather around SOMEONE<George>. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS127
00:28:56,00 --> 00:29:03,50
He notices SOMEONE<Sally> approaching. A photographer snaps a picture. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS128
00:29:00,00 --> 00:29:05,50
SOMEONE<Sally> stares past SOMEONE<George> and frowns. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS129
00:29:05,00 --> 00:29:12,50
He turns around and sees only blank canvases adorning the walls. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS130
00:29:12,00 --> 00:29:18,50
Now he awakes in bed. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS131
00:29:27,00 --> 00:29:38,50
On a busy city street, traffic lights turn from green to red. In the kitchen SOMEONE<George> fills a bowl with cereal, then glances around. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS132
00:29:37,00 --> 00:29:43,50
He pours in the last few drops of milk from a carton. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS133
00:29:44,00 --> 00:29:52,50
Stepping into a doorway, he sees SOMEONE<Jack> hunched over paperwork in an office across the hall. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS134
00:29:55,00 --> 00:30:03,50
SOMEONE<George> watches his frustrated stepfather set one page aside and grab another. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS135
00:30:02,00 --> 00:30:16,50
The teen takes out his cellphone and reads a text message from SOMEONE<Sally>, Happy New Year. Meet me at SOMEONE's<Zoe's>. 6 SOMEONE<Columbus> Circle. 20th floor. SOMEONE<George> walks off. Now he knocks on a door. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS136
00:30:14,00 --> 00:30:20,50
SOMEONE<Sally> answers it wearing a shiny Lamé dress. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS137
00:30:18,00 --> 00:30:23,50
SOMEONE<George> gawks at her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS138
00:30:26,00 --> 00:30:31,50
He follows her inside. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS139
00:30:34,00 --> 00:30:41,50
She leads him downstairs to a chic living room where they join SOMEONE<Zoe> and a girlfriend. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS140
00:30:57,00 --> 00:31:03,50
A blond guy sits across from them. His friend sits beside SOMEONE<George>. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS141
00:31:23,00 --> 00:31:27,50
SOMEONE<Will> arrives. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS142
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:37,50
SOMEONE<George> picks up a card reading, New Year's Eve Party. Then flips it over to find his drawing. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS143
00:31:35,00 --> 00:31:40,50
He smiles at his work. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS144
00:31:43,00 --> 00:31:50,50
Later on a quiet street SOMEONE<George> and SOMEONE<Sally> walk together following the others. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS145
00:31:48,00 --> 00:31:54,50
Now in a trendy nightclub, she leads him through the crowd. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS146
00:32:03,00 --> 00:32:08,50
She leads him across the dance floor. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS147
00:32:11,00 --> 00:32:24,50
SOMEONE<Will> hands him a bottle of champagne. SOMEONE<Sally> leads SOMEONE<George> to the middle of the dance floor. A strobe light flashes on the anxious teen. Facing him, SOMEONE<Sally> brushes back her hair. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS148
00:32:22,00 --> 00:32:29,50
SOMEONE<George> tries to dance, awkwardly swaying to the music. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS149
00:32:26,00 --> 00:32:31,50
SOMEONE<Sally> grins as she watches him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS150
00:32:31,00 --> 00:32:38,50
SOMEONE<George> smiles and watches her dance ecstatically with her eyes closed. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS151
00:32:39,00 --> 00:32:46,50
SOMEONE<Nick> and SOMEONE<Sally> hug. As he dances close to her she looks at SOMEONE<George>. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS152
00:32:45,00 --> 00:32:53,50
He pleasantly raises his bottle of champagne then backs away disappearing within the crowd. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS153
00:32:53,00 --> 00:33:01,50
SOMEONE<Sally> watches him go, then turns her attention back to SOMEONE<Nick> as she dances with him joyfully. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS154
00:33:01,00 --> 00:33:07,50
Now, SOMEONE<George> walks through the crowd. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS155
00:33:05,00 --> 00:33:13,50
He approaches SOMEONE's<Sally's> friends at the bar. SOMEONE<Zoe> turns to him, holding a shot. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS156
00:33:10,00 --> 00:33:15,50
They all raise shots. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS157
00:33:15,00 --> 00:33:20,50
SOMEONE<Zoe> studies SOMEONE<George>. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS158
00:33:35,00 --> 00:33:41,50
A blond girl whispers in SOMEONE's<Zoe's> ear then leads her off. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS159
00:33:41,00 --> 00:33:46,50
SOMEONE<George> watches her go. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS161
00:33:45,00 --> 00:33:56,50
Wandering through the crowded dance floor SOMEONE<George> glimpses SOMEONE<Sally> still dancing with SOMEONE<Nick>. As SOMEONE<George> moves on someone hands him a shot. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS162
00:33:56,00 --> 00:34:01,50
He toasts with the group. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS163
00:34:00,00 --> 00:34:12,50
A brilliant disco lights swings by overhead as he shifts his dull gaze. Strobe-like flashes of the tightly packed club goers go in and out of focus. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS164
00:34:11,00 --> 00:34:17,50
SOMEONE<George> stumbles through the crowd. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS165
00:34:14,00 --> 00:34:23,50
Outside, he shuffles across the street and vomits, catching the attention of two bystanders. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS166
00:34:24,00 --> 00:34:29,50
He sits back against a wall. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS167
00:34:27,00 --> 00:34:31,50
He spits. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS168
00:34:30,00 --> 00:34:37,50
A string of saliva falls from his mouth as he sits up and catches his breath. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS169
00:34:35,00 --> 00:34:45,50
He undoes a button of his shirt, then hangs his head with his eyes half closed. Down the block, a group of pedestrians walks by. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS170
00:34:46,00 --> 00:34:53,50
Later, SOMEONE<George> lies alone, passed out against the wall. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS171
00:34:50,00 --> 00:34:58,50
Crossing the street, SOMEONE<Sally> picks up her pace as she finds her lost friend. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS172
00:34:58,00 --> 00:35:06,50
She crouches at SOMEONE's<George's> side and helps him sit up against the graffitied wall. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS173
00:35:05,00 --> 00:35:16,50
Now, with SOMEONE's<George's> arm draped over her shoulders, SOMEONE<Sally> helps him into her bedroom. Leaning him against the door jam, she doffs her coat. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS174
00:35:23,00 --> 00:35:29,50
She rolls out the lower level of a trundle bed. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS175
00:35:29,00 --> 00:35:34,50
She grabs a pillow and a comforter. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS176
00:35:43,00 --> 00:35:49,50
She twitches a smile then straightens SOMEONE's<George's> overcoat. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS177
00:35:51,00 --> 00:35:56,50
SOMEONE<Sally> blinks over her smile and averts her gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS178
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:05,50
With a kind look she reaches for him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS179
00:36:04,00 --> 00:36:19,50
She slides his coat off then steadies him as he staggers to the bed. Holding his side, she guides him to the lower bed beside her own. He flops back on it, then watches as she spreads the comforter over him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS180
00:36:16,00 --> 00:36:23,50
SOMEONE<Sally> turns her back to him and switches off a lamp on a dresser. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS181
00:36:20,00 --> 00:36:28,50
As SOMEONE's<George's> eyelids open and close between wakefulness and sleep, he glimpses her intermittently. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS182
00:36:26,00 --> 00:36:32,50
With her back to him, SOMEONE<Sally> slides out a dresser drawer. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS183
00:36:30,00 --> 00:36:37,50
She pulls her dress up over her head, revealing her bra. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS184
00:36:35,00 --> 00:36:40,50
She puts on a three quarter sleeve baseball T. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS185
00:36:38,00 --> 00:36:45,50
As she dons pajama pants, she glances over her shoulder at SOMEONE<George>. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS186
00:36:42,00 --> 00:36:48,50
He sees her just before his eyes fall shut. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS187
00:36:45,00 --> 00:36:52,50
One last glimpse shows the dresser without SOMEONE<Sally> in front of it. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS188
00:36:50,00 --> 00:36:57,50
Now, pale light glows on SOMEONE's<George's> sleeping face. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS189
00:36:54,00 --> 00:36:59,50
His eyelids flutter and he wakes up. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS190
00:36:56,00 --> 00:37:04,50
Shifting his head on the pillow, he turns to SOMEONE<Sally> and watches her sleep. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS191
00:37:07,00 --> 00:37:17,50
He props himself up on his elbows and sweeps his gaze up SOMEONE's face, taking in her rosy lips, smooth cheeks, and closed eyes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS193
00:37:16,00 --> 00:37:22,50
Still studying her beauty, he lies back. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS194
00:37:22,00 --> 00:37:30,50
With his thoughtful gaze fixed on the sleeping girl, SOMEONE<George> lets his eyelids shut. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS195
00:37:30,00 --> 00:37:46,50
Morning. Propped on one elbow, SOMEONE<Sally> sits awake in bed, her eyes darting to the lower regions of SOMEONE's<George's> blanket. She presses her lips together to stifle a smile, then shifts her gaze to SOMEONE<George> who blinks awake and looks up at her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS196
00:37:48,00 --> 00:37:58,50
He smiles. Following SOMEONE's<Sally's> gaze, he sees his morning wood jetting up under the blanket. He rolls off the bed. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS197
00:37:55,00 --> 00:38:01,50
He glances at SOMEONE<Sally>, then drops his head. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS198
00:37:58,00 --> 00:38:08,50
Later in the dining room, Mrs. SOMEONE<Howe> brings SOMEONE<George> a Bloody SOMEONE<Mary> garnished with a celery stalk and bendy straw. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS199
00:38:15,00 --> 00:38:23,50
Sitting kitty corner to SOMEONE's<Sally's> mom SOMEONE<George> nods, then sips the drink. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS200
00:38:22,00 --> 00:38:27,50
He shoots her an alarmed look. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS201
00:38:36,00 --> 00:38:44,50
She pushes her chair out and strides away. Her mother glances after her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS202
00:38:43,00 --> 00:38:47,50
SOMEONE<George> smiles. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS203
00:38:45,00 --> 00:39:04,50
He lifts the straw to his lips and drinks. Now he follows SOMEONE<Jack> down a sidewalk. Slowing his pace, he watches his stepfather grab a newspaper off the top of a trash can then cross the street. With his eyes fixed on the man, SOMEONE<George> remains on the opposite sidewalk. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS204
00:39:01,00 --> 00:39:08,50
He pauses behind a pair of pay phones then takes a few steps and sees 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS205
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:11,50
SOMEONE<Jack> sitting on a bench in a crowded bus shelter. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS206
00:39:08,00 --> 00:39:14,50
The people waiting around him stir as a bus pulls up. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS207
00:39:11,00 --> 00:39:18,50
The bus glides away to reveal SOMEONE<Jack> alone on the shelter bench. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS208
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:37,50
He reads the newspaper. Later SOMEONE<George> exits an elevator in an office building. He walks down a barren corridor and stops in front of a door. His jaw drops as he spots an eviction notice taped to it. The door's shiny nameplate reads, SOMEONE<John> Sargent. Marketing Research Incorporated. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS209
00:39:35,00 --> 00:39:45,50
Nighttime. Wearing dark framed glasses, SOMEONE<Sally> sits on her bed and reads. Her mother joins her as she folds her daughter's clothes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS210
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:40,50
SOMEONE<Sally> gives her mother a pointed look. With a faint smile, Charlotte glances away. Now in a gallery at the Whitney Museum, SOMEONE<George> and SOMEONE<Dustin> face a gray canvas covered with chalky scribbles. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS211
00:40:58,00 --> 00:41:07,50
Wearing a coiled white scarf, SOMEONE<Dustin> moves to a painting of two red rectangles below a white one. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS212
00:41:09,00 --> 00:41:14,50
SOMEONE<George> nods uncertainly. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS213
00:41:23,00 --> 00:41:29,50
He glances at SOMEONE<George> then returns his gaze to the paintings. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS214
00:41:26,00 --> 00:41:34,50
SOMEONE<George> shrugs, then moves to another painting. SOMEONE<Dustin> joins him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS215
00:41:53,00 --> 00:41:59,50
SOMEONE<Dustin> gazes at the piece of art. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS216
00:42:00,00 --> 00:42:07,50
SOMEONE<George> eyes him thoughtfully, then steps in front of the next piece. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS217
00:42:04,00 --> 00:42:14,50
The sharp perspective canvas shows six rows of plates each holding a slice of cake or pie identical to the others in its row. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS219
00:42:17,00 --> 00:42:21,50
He gives an embarrassed shrug. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS220
00:42:20,00 --> 00:42:25,50
SOMEONE<Dustin> eyes the plates. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS221
00:42:27,00 --> 00:42:34,50
With a knowing smile, SOMEONE<Dustin> leaves SOMEONE<George> staring at the image. SOMEONE<Dustin> leaves. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS222
00:42:33,00 --> 00:42:39,50
Now SOMEONE<Sally> sits across from SOMEONE<George> at a restaurant. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS223
00:42:36,00 --> 00:42:43,50
A plastic table stand between them reads, Valentine's Day menu. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS224
00:42:55,00 --> 00:43:00,50
SOMEONE<George> nods and smiles. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS225
00:43:21,00 --> 00:43:26,50
Nodding, SOMEONE<Sally> stares down at the table. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS226
00:43:41,00 --> 00:43:46,50
He folds his hands on the table. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS228
00:44:34,00 --> 00:44:38,50
Staring at SOMEONE<Sally>, he gives a faint sad smile. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS229
00:44:38,00 --> 00:44:45,50
SOMEONE<Sally> shoots him a thoughtful look, then lowers her eyes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS230
00:44:46,00 --> 00:44:50,50
She meets his gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS231
00:44:51,00 --> 00:44:57,50
Starring into SOMEONE's<Sally's> eyes, SOMEONE<George> gives a tiny nod. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS232
00:44:54,00 --> 00:45:00,50
She twitches a smile then brushes hair away from her face. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS233
00:45:14,00 --> 00:45:20,50
He grins. SOMEONE<Sally> rumples her lips. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS234
00:45:30,00 --> 00:45:35,50
SOMEONE<George> stares at her with hard eyes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS235
00:45:37,00 --> 00:45:44,50
SOMEONE<George> presses his lips into a tight line. He averts his gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS236
00:46:02,00 --> 00:46:10,50
As she peers directly at SOMEONE<George> his eyes widen. His lips part fumbling. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS237
00:46:08,00 --> 00:46:12,50
SOMEONE<Sally> bows her head. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS238
00:46:20,00 --> 00:46:27,50
She averts her gaze as SOMEONE<George> stares crestfallen, SOMEONE<Sally> leans toward him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS239
00:46:29,00 --> 00:46:35,50
As she sits back and sips her drink SOMEONE<George> lowers his gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS240
00:46:34,00 --> 00:46:44,50
Later, heading down a sidewalk with SOMEONE<Sally>, SOMEONE<George> stares straight ahead. His hands in his pockets and his face sullen. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS241
00:46:43,00 --> 00:46:48,50
SOMEONE<Sally> glances at him but he avoids her gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS242
00:46:49,00 --> 00:46:54,50
He looks down thoughtfully. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS243
00:46:53,00 --> 00:46:57,50
He stops walking. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS244
00:47:04,00 --> 00:47:11,50
SOMEONE<Sally> blinks her confused eyes. SOMEONE<George> stares back angrily. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS245
00:47:11,00 --> 00:47:16,50
He turns on his heels and strides away. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS246
00:47:15,00 --> 00:47:23,50
Staring after him she shakes her head then storms off in the opposite direction. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS247
00:47:20,00 --> 00:47:29,50
Now, SOMEONE<George> lies on his bed with his hands folded under his head. His iPod plays beside him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS248
00:47:28,00 --> 00:47:39,50
His phone display flashes. SOMEONE<Sally> calling. With a sour look, he rejects the calls then smooths the front of his shirt and folds his hands behind his head. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS249
00:47:45,00 --> 00:47:53,50
SOMEONE<George> shoots his cell a brooding glance, then reaches for his iPod and hits play. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS250
00:47:53,00 --> 00:48:01,50
Now he wears a different but similar outfit as he lies on his bed with his eyes closed. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS251
00:48:02,00 --> 00:48:08,50
His mother raps on the door. She opens it and looks in. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS252
00:48:27,00 --> 00:48:33,50
His mother stares at him, her brow creased. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS253
00:48:31,00 --> 00:48:41,50
Slack jawed, she closes the door as she leaves. SOMEONE<George> lies with his arms folded over his stomach and his eyes shut. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS254
00:48:43,00 --> 00:48:49,50
He presses play on his iPod and lies back. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS255
00:48:49,00 --> 00:49:04,50
Now at school SOMEONE<Sally> sits in the lunchroom with SOMEONE<Will> and SOMEONE<Zoe>. She glances back at SOMEONE<George> reading alone one table away. SOMEONE<Will> scrutinizes him curiously, and SOMEONE<Zoe> wears a wounded expression. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS256
00:49:01,00 --> 00:49:10,50
Later, SOMEONE<George> lies on his bed gazing dourly at the ceiling. SOMEONE<Jack> opens the door and gawks. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS257
00:49:22,00 --> 00:49:26,50
SOMEONE<George> stares at him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS258
00:49:26,00 --> 00:49:37,50
Rolling his eyes, SOMEONE<George> returns his gaze to the ceiling. SOMEONE<Jack> stares at him for a moment then backs out of the room and closes the door. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS259
00:49:38,00 --> 00:49:45,50
SOMEONE<George> shuts his eyes. Meanwhile SOMEONE<Sally> listens on her phone. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS260
00:49:43,00 --> 00:49:49,50
She ends the call then hits redial. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS261
00:49:51,00 --> 00:50:20,50
With a frustrated look she hangs up. Striding down a waterfront walkway she pauses as she notices someone up ahead. She smiles faintly then heads over to SOMEONE<Dustin> who sits on a low stonewall sketching on a pad. Later, SOMEONE<Sally> strides down a sidewalk. SOMEONE<George> approaches from the opposite direction. His hands in his coat pockets and his gaze fixed on the ground. The two teens walk right past each other offering no sign of acknowledgment. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS262
00:50:19,00 --> 00:50:27,50
Evening. Pale sunlight gleams off cars parked on both sides of a city. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS263
00:50:25,00 --> 00:50:40,50
White letters on a red sign outside of a bar read, SOMEONE's<Lou’s>. Sitting alone inside SOMEONE<Sally> brushes her bangs out of her face, then glances at the door as it opens. SOMEONE<Dustin> joins her at the bar. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS264
00:51:10,00 --> 00:51:16,50
Shifting uneasily, SOMEONE<Dustin> tucks some hair behind one ear. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS265
00:51:22,00 --> 00:51:34,50
One elbow on the bar, SOMEONE<Dustin> runs a hand through his wavy hair. He props his head on it and gazes at SOMEONE<Sally> with wistful eyes. He offers a restrained smile. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS266
00:51:39,00 --> 00:51:44,50
She gives him an annoyed look. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS267
00:51:43,00 --> 00:51:50,50
As she gently sways back and forth in her seat, SOMEONE<Dustin> turns away. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS268
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:54,50
SOMEONE<Sally> slides out of her chair. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS269
00:51:51,00 --> 00:51:56,50
She offers her hand. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS270
00:51:54,00 --> 00:52:08,50
SOMEONE<Dustin> accepts, then rises from his chair. Gazing into his eyes, she lifts his hand and spins under his arm. As she pulls him in and starts to dance he sits again. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS271
00:52:11,00 --> 00:52:20,50
SOMEONE<Sally> nods then breaks into a flirtatious smile. Closing her eyes, she begins to dance in front of SOMEONE<Dustin>. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS272
00:52:18,00 --> 00:52:31,50
She sways sensually and the artist gives a longing look. Daytime. In class, SOMEONE<George> stares out a window at a neighboring building. A bird flies past. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS273
00:52:28,00 --> 00:52:36,50
As his English teacher collects the students’ papers, she stops at his desk and touches his shoulder. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS274
00:52:34,00 --> 00:52:39,50
She notes his distant expression. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS275
00:52:54,00 --> 00:52:59,50
His teacher frowns. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS276
00:52:58,00 --> 00:53:02,50
SOMEONE averts his head. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS277
00:53:03,00 --> 00:53:08,50
Now, SOMEONE<George> arrives at the school office. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS278
00:53:06,00 --> 00:53:16,50
The assistant sheepishly meets his gaze. SOMEONE<George> proceeds to the Principal's office. Later he sits wringing his hands. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS279
00:53:34,00 --> 00:53:40,50
Three of SOMEONE's<George's> teachers sit in the room. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS280
00:54:21,00 --> 00:54:26,50
The English teacher purses her lip. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS281
00:54:23,00 --> 00:54:30,50
With glistening eyes, SOMEONE<George> looks up at SOMEONE<Harris> who avoids his gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS282
00:54:42,00 --> 00:54:47,50
The math teacher gives him a harsh look. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS283
00:54:45,00 --> 00:54:50,50
He rubs tears from his eyes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS284
00:55:07,00 --> 00:55:16,50
The sober faced teachers stay put as SOMEONE<George> gets up from the couch and exits. He turns back at the open door. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS285
00:55:20,00 --> 00:55:26,50
He continues out with a numb expression. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS286
00:55:23,00 --> 00:55:29,50
Now Vivian and SOMEONE<Jack> sit waiting for him at home. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS287
00:55:27,00 --> 00:55:34,50
The distraught mother dabs at the corners of her eyes with her pinkie. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS288
00:55:33,00 --> 00:55:38,50
SOMEONE<George> steps into the room. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS289
00:56:38,00 --> 00:56:44,50
SOMEONE<Jack> grabs him roughly and they wrestle to the floor. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS290
00:56:42,00 --> 00:56:49,50
As SOMEONE<George> gets back up his stepfather restrains him from behind. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS291
00:56:47,00 --> 00:56:55,50
He backs SOMEONE<Jack> into the doorframe and the older man slumps to the floor clutching his shoulder. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS292
00:56:53,00 --> 00:56:58,50
The troubled teen runs out. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS293
00:56:55,00 --> 00:57:02,50
Later, our view chases after him as he races through the park. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS294
00:57:01,00 --> 00:57:08,50
Night falls as he bolts down SOMEONE's<Sally's> street and into her apartment building. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS295
00:57:13,00 --> 00:57:18,50
He catches his breath as she answers. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS296
00:57:17,00 --> 00:57:22,50
She slips out shutting the door behind her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS297
00:57:25,00 --> 00:57:30,50
He presses her up against the door and kisses her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS298
00:57:32,00 --> 00:57:38,50
She pushes him back and frowns uncomfortably. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS299
00:57:37,00 --> 00:57:43,50
With a heavy blink, she lifts her brown eyes to meet his. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS300
00:57:42,00 --> 00:57:51,50
SOMEONE<Sally> twists the doorknob behind her back. She pushes the door open a crack and SOMEONE<George> takes a look inside. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS301
00:57:48,00 --> 00:57:56,50
Charlotte sits on the sofa near SOMEONE<Dustin> who guiltily leans forward in an armchair. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS302
00:57:53,00 --> 00:57:59,50
Later, SOMEONE<George> marches away from the apartment building. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS303
00:57:58,00 --> 00:58:03,50
SOMEONE<Dustin> runs out after him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS304
00:58:04,00 --> 00:58:10,50
The boy turns around with a wounded glare. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS305
00:58:09,00 --> 00:58:14,50
SOMEONE<George> pouts, his eyes glistening. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS306
00:58:53,00 --> 00:58:58,50
Tears stream down SOMEONE's<George's> cheek. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS307
00:58:58,00 --> 00:59:02,50
The boy dries his face 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS308
00:58:59,00 --> 00:59:04,50
with his sleeve, then glances off pensively. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS309
00:59:03,00 --> 00:59:08,50
He flashes a wry dimpled smile. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS310
00:59:07,00 --> 00:59:13,50
Dusting contritely shifts his arms at his sides. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS311
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:18,50
SOMEONE's<George's> chin furrows sadly as he stares at his mentor. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS312
00:59:15,00 --> 00:59:20,50
SOMEONE<Dustin> returns a solemn, remorseful look. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS313
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:31,50
SOMEONE<George> turns around and mopes off down the block of brown stone buildings. Later he sulks at a bar while SOMEONE<Zoe>, SOMEONE<Will> and others have a good time all around him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS314
00:59:28,00 --> 00:59:35,50
Someone passes in front of our view as the picture fades to black. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS315
00:59:36,00 --> 00:59:44,50
In the early morning under a gray sky SOMEONE<George> walks down the middle of a street. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS316
00:59:41,00 --> 00:59:53,50
Later he strolls through a park on a pathway between tall leafy trees and approaches Vivian sitting on a bench. His shoulders sag as he lets out a sigh. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS317
00:59:51,00 --> 00:59:57,50
His mother smiles at him and lifts her eyebrows. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS318
01:00:24,00 --> 01:00:36,50
SOMEONE<George> tightens his lips and takes a seat beside her on the bench. He folds his overcoat closed as a strong breeze blows through some trees and bushes at a wall behind them. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS319
01:01:22,00 --> 01:01:28,50
Smiling gently she closes her eyes and lets out a breath. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS320
01:01:39,00 --> 01:01:48,50
She closes her hands over her nose and mouth as she sobs. SOMEONE<George> puts his arm around her and kisses her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS321
01:01:48,00 --> 01:01:54,50
He rests his cheek against her honey blond hair. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS322
01:01:53,00 --> 01:01:59,50
Later, SOMEONE<George> strides into the Principal's office. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS323
01:02:17,00 --> 01:02:22,50
SOMEONE<George> hurries out. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS324
01:02:19,00 --> 01:02:24,50
Now in the art room. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS325
01:03:23,00 --> 01:03:30,50
Later, SOMEONE<George> leaves the school with a tall stack of assignments. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS326
01:03:28,00 --> 01:03:33,50
SOMEONE<Sally> falls into step with him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS327
01:03:48,00 --> 01:03:53,50
SOMEONE<George> stops and faces her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS328
01:03:55,00 --> 01:04:02,50
SOMEONE's<Sally's> mouth creases as she stares at him remorsefully. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS329
01:04:06,00 --> 01:04:11,50
He walks off leaving her behind. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS330
01:04:10,00 --> 01:04:14,50
Later at home. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS332
01:04:23,00 --> 01:04:45,50
As he heads off, Vivian watches him fondly. In his bedroom SOMEONE<George> plops the thick stack of assignments down on his desk. He removes his coat. Rolling up his sleeves he takes a seat at his desk and straightens the pile of homework. He stares at the daunting stack of folders and assignment books for a moment then turns on a lamp and opens up his laptop. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS333
01:04:42,00 --> 01:04:50,50
On another day, our view travels across his bedroom to find him hard at work at his desk. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS334
01:05:01,00 --> 01:05:08,50
He works out a trigonometry equation. Vivian shows in another couple. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS335
01:05:17,00 --> 01:05:29,50
Later, SOMEONE<George> sets up a blank canvas on an easel and stares at it. In the kitchen Vivian wraps up pieces of pottery in newspaper and boxes them. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS336
01:05:36,00 --> 01:05:42,50
SOMEONE<George> writes an essay on ruled notebook paper. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS337
01:05:43,00 --> 01:05:50,50
He now takes a brush to his canvas and starts his painting. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS338
01:05:48,00 --> 01:06:19,50
He mixes shades of emerald and white to form a pale green. Later on the canvas, he uses thick brush strokes to apply streaks of white over the green. He paints a purple vertical line, then shadows it in burnt sienna. Now at school he writes an essay for his English final. Later he uses a calculator to work out a problem for his trig final. Back at home, he solves another long equation, types on his laptop and fills in answers on some French homework. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS339
01:06:17,00 --> 01:06:53,50
He types up a paper citing the Thoreau's Civil Disobedience. Taking an essay test he begins an answer with a mention of SOMEONE<Francis> Bacon and SOMEONE<David> Hockney. For a multiple-choice question he circles the answer, Renaissance. Back at home he rubs his eye then places a completed assignment atop a stack and grabs the next piece of homework. Now in his loft, SOMEONE<Dustin> works on a painting as dawn breaks outside his windows. SOMEONE<Sally> wakes up in his bed and watches him deliberately stub out a lit cigarette near the bottom corner of the canvas. Her eyes lower pensively. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS340
01:06:55,00 --> 01:07:02,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<George> works on his own painting in a white T-shirt. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS341
01:07:03,00 --> 01:07:11,50
Vivian smiles in his doorway drying her hands on a towel. SOMEONE<George> grins. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS342
01:07:09,00 --> 01:07:14,50
Vivian looks around the bare walls. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS343
01:07:14,00 --> 01:07:20,50
He eyes his canvas. Later. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS344
01:08:06,00 --> 01:08:12,50
Vivian admires her son as she shakes her head. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS345
01:08:09,00 --> 01:08:17,50
Later, SOMEONE<George> strolls into his room where only his twin size bed remains. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS346
01:08:22,00 --> 01:08:28,50
He gets a text from SOMEONE<Sally>, I need to see you. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS347
01:08:28,00 --> 01:08:41,50
Now an illuminated awning over an entry way reads, Lou's. Inside the softly lit bar, SOMEONE<George> and SOMEONE<Sally> share a booth, each with a bottle of beer on the table. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS348
01:08:40,00 --> 01:08:45,50
Her friend musters a tight smile. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS349
01:08:54,00 --> 01:09:00,50
SOMEONE<George> responds with a forgiving nod. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS350
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:08,50
SOMEONE's<George's> eyes glisten and he presses his lip. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS351
01:10:14,00 --> 01:10:21,50
SOMEONE<Sally> gives him a grave nod. He bravely looks her in the eye. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS352
01:10:22,00 --> 01:10:27,50
SOMEONE<Sally> lowers her gaze. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS353
01:10:24,00 --> 01:10:32,50
She rubs her neck then rests her head in her hand and allows a brief sad smile. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS354
01:10:49,00 --> 01:10:54,50
SOMEONE<Sally> looks down and bites her lips. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS355
01:10:54,00 --> 01:11:02,50
With a faint smile, she reaches out and takes his hand in hers stroking his fingers with her thumb. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS356
01:11:01,00 --> 01:11:11,50
Later as they follow the sidewalk, the young beauty casually bumps against SOMEONE<George>, then tucks her hair behind her ear. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS357
01:11:08,00 --> 01:11:14,50
Their interlocked hands sway gently with their 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS358
01:11:11,00 --> 01:11:17,50
Now they arrive at her deserted apartment. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS359
01:11:15,00 --> 01:11:23,50
They sit before laced curtained windows filled with soft golden light and kiss tenderly. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS360
01:11:22,00 --> 01:11:27,50
Pulling back SOMEONE<Sally> beams at SOMEONE<George>. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS361
01:11:25,00 --> 01:11:31,50
He invitingly brushes the tip of her nose with his. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS362
01:11:28,00 --> 01:11:35,50
Her smile grows and she brings her lips to his again. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS363
01:11:33,00 --> 01:11:42,50
As they share a series of soft gentle kisses, her hand moves up to his shoulder. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS364
01:11:41,00 --> 01:11:52,50
Now in the soft predawn light, street lamps twinkle beyond a weathered wooden bench. SOMEONE<George> strolls into view and takes a seat. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS365
01:11:51,00 --> 01:11:57,50
He stares off, his lips pursed in a thoughtful pout. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS366
01:11:55,00 --> 01:12:03,50
Back in Charlotte's empty apartment SOMEONE<Sally> pulls away abruptly and looks up at SOMEONE<George>. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS367
01:12:13,00 --> 01:12:18,50
SOMEONE<George> gives her an eager kiss. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS368
01:12:22,00 --> 01:12:28,50
SOMEONE<Sally> kisses him and drapes her arms around his shoulders. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS369
01:12:26,00 --> 01:12:31,50
He smiles down at her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS370
01:12:38,00 --> 01:12:44,50
On the bench SOMEONE<George> gives a hopeful smile. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS371
01:12:42,00 --> 01:12:47,50
He lowers his gaze and licks his lips 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS372
01:12:46,00 --> 01:12:54,50
Now, verdant tree branches dapple our view of a bright blue sky patched 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS373
01:12:51,00 --> 01:12:55,50
with wispy clouds. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS375
01:12:57,00 --> 01:13:02,50
She sets a heavy backpack at her feet. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS376
01:12:59,00 --> 01:13:06,50
Then slips her hands in her pockets and cranes her neck for a view up the street. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS377
01:13:04,00 --> 01:13:18,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE<George> leaves his building with his now draped canvas tucked under one arm. His other arm curls around the massive stack of completed homework assignments as he heads down the sidewalk at a brisk pace. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS378
01:13:16,00 --> 01:13:23,50
Now, cars line up outside an international terminal at an airport. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS379
01:13:20,00 --> 01:13:29,50
A black luxury car with tinted windows pulls into view and parks at the curb. SOMEONE<Sally> and SOMEONE<Dustin> get out. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS380
01:13:26,00 --> 01:13:42,50
The trunk pops open and they reach in for their bags. In the Principal's office SOMEONE's<George's> hands set the massive stack of assignments down on the desk. Working facing the wall, the administrator turns and looks up at SOMEONE<George>. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS381
01:13:41,00 --> 01:13:46,50
He eyes the stack. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS382
01:13:52,00 --> 01:14:01,50
At the airport, SOMEONE<Sally> and SOMEONE<Dustin> arrive at the boarding area where other passengers file through a gate. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS383
01:13:58,00 --> 01:14:07,50
The teen girl hesitates and looks around. In the art room, SOMEONE<Harris> sets SOMEONE's<George's> canvas on an easel. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS384
01:14:04,00 --> 01:14:14,50
He steps back, his hands on his hips and regards it shrewdly as his troubled student stands nearby. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS385
01:14:11,00 --> 01:14:17,50
The art teacher faces SOMEONE<George> with a cocked eyebrow. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS386
01:14:14,00 --> 01:14:31,50
He shoves the boy, then envelops him in a proud embrace. The teen gives a dimpled smile as he returns the hug, then faces his work with gleaming eyes. SOMEONE<Harris> puts an arm around his shoulder and looks at the painting with an appreciative scowl. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS387
01:14:32,00 --> 01:14:43,50
At the boarding gate, SOMEONE<Sally> lingers by a window. Now a banner over the school entrance reads, Morgan. Congratulations, Seniors. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS388
01:14:42,00 --> 01:14:47,50
SOMEONE<Zoe> sits by SOMEONE<George>. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS389
01:14:45,00 --> 01:14:50,50
He shakes his head. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS390
01:14:55,00 --> 01:15:03,50
On her other side SOMEONE<Will> stands, goes to the stage and shakes the Principal's hand. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS391
01:15:03,00 --> 01:15:09,50
The teen takes his diploma and executes a groovy spin. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS392
01:15:07,00 --> 01:15:20,50
SOMEONE<George> chuckles fondly and SOMEONE<Zoe> laughs into her hand. They briefly share a smile. At the boarding gate, SOMEONE<Dustin> checks with a ticket agent then joins SOMEONE<Sally> at the sun lit window. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS393
01:15:33,00 --> 01:15:42,50
With a fond smirk SOMEONE<Dustin> steps closer, cradles her head in his hands and gives her a tender kiss. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS394
01:15:39,00 --> 01:15:58,50
SOMEONE<Sally> briefly averts her gaze then flashes a wan smile. SOMEONE<Dustin> kisses her again. At graduation, SOMEONE's<George's> expression grows pensive. At the airport SOMEONE<Sally> lowers her gaze then smiles at SOMEONE<Dustin> again. At school, SOMEONE<Zoe> notices SOMEONE's<George's> tense demeanor. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS395
01:16:07,00 --> 01:16:13,50
SOMEONE<Zoe> beams warmly at him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS396
01:16:13,00 --> 01:16:40,50
The principal leans over the podium looking straight at him. SOMEONE<George> lifts his gaze, his hazel eyes gleaming. In slow motion he stands and makes his way to the stage. SOMEONE<Zoe> and SOMEONE<Will> grin after him. His mother beams happily. As he reaches the stage SOMEONE<Cynthia> winks at him. SOMEONE<Harris> regards him proudly.

01:16:47,00 --> 01:16:59,50
He holds out SOMEONE's<George's> diploma. As the teen accepts it the Principal pats him on the arm and steps away. SOMEONE<George> smiles after him appreciatively.

01:16:56,00 --> 01:17:21,50
As he faces the audience, sunlight flares in brightly through a window behind him. His mother beams proudly, her eyes glistening. The teen scans the room. Elsewhere SOMEONE<Sally> turns, her surroundings washed out by sunlight. At graduation, SOMEONE's<George's> eyes shine as he lingers on the stage. Outside, tree branches bordering the streets sway gently in a breeze.

01:17:19,00 --> 01:17:27,50
At the school a teen girl comes outside in her cap and gown and joins two fellow graduates.

01:17:30,00 --> 01:17:41,50
In the art room, SOMEONE<George> stands with his graduation robe slung over one arm. On the easel, his painting offers a portrait of SOMEONE<Sally> in

01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:42,50
tints of green and purple. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS403
01:17:39,00 --> 01:17:52,50
The subject gazes off with a stoic expression hinting at wisdom beyond her years. Turning away, SOMEONE<George> sets his diploma and graduation robes on a chair.

01:17:49,00 --> 01:18:02,50
As he turns back he halts and stares. In the doorway SOMEONE<Sally> stands with her hands clasped before her. She offers a little smile and he regards her with shining eyes. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS405
01:17:59,00 --> 01:18:08,50
The teen girl enters the room holding SOMEONE<George> in a solemn gaze. SOMEONE's<George's> eyes follow her. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS406
01:18:05,00 --> 01:18:13,50
As she passes obliviously behind her own portrait, moving with slow deliberate steps, 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS407
01:18:10,00 --> 01:18:14,50
she keeps her gaze on him. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS408
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:30,50
Approaching the young artist, she regards the portrait appraisingly then tilts her head and smiles. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS409
01:18:27,00 --> 01:18:34,50
SOMEONE<George> glances at the painting then eyes SOMEONE<Sally> anxiously. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS411
01:18:37,00 --> 01:18:47,50
SOMEONE's<Sally's> gaze cools and his smile vanishes. She joins him at his side then faces the portrait again. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS412
01:18:48,00 --> 01:18:55,50
She looks up at him with a teasing smirk. SOMEONE<George> beams understandingly. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS413
01:18:53,00 --> 01:18:58,50
His hand reaches out taking a gentle hold of SOMEONE<Sally>. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS414
01:18:56,00 --> 01:19:03,50
As they linger facing the painting together she glances at him fondly. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS415
01:19:06,00 --> 01:19:15,50
SOMEONE<Sally> heaves a grave sigh. She faces SOMEONE<George> intently then looks back at the painting. 

THE_ART_OF_GETTING_BY_DVS416
01:19:13,00 --> 01:19:26,50
The two teens hesitantly met each other's gaze. SOMEONE<Sally> yields a coy smile and turns toward the painting. SOMEONE<George> follows her example with a hopeful gaze.
