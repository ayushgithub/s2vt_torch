THE_CALL_DVS51
00:02:57,00 --> 00:03:05,50
In the high-ceilinged modern facility, a slender woman with short, curly hair swivels in her chair. 

THE_CALL_DVS68
00:03:53,00 --> 00:04:00,50
She raises her arms as a message flashes on her screen. Call disconnected. 

THE_CALL_DVS69
00:03:57,00 --> 00:04:04,50
The 911 operator locks her hands behind her head and leans back in her chair. 

THE_CALL_DVS70
00:04:01,00 --> 00:04:08,50
Looking at her computer, she exhales deeply and sets her arms down. 

THE_CALL_DVS71
00:04:05,00 --> 00:04:13,50
She types Unit on scene 13:48 hours, then answers an incoming call. 

THE_CALL_DVS72
00:04:14,00 --> 00:04:19,50
She tilts her head and smiles. 

THE_CALL_DVS73
00:04:36,00 --> 00:04:41,50
She trades a smile with an older woman. 

THE_CALL_DVS74
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:05,50
A cop enters and gives the operator a kiss. 

THE_CALL_DVS75
00:05:34,00 --> 00:05:38,50
She leaves with the policeman. 

THE_CALL_DVS76
00:05:35,00 --> 00:05:42,50
Now outside, he sits on a table and she stands between his knees in an embrace. 

THE_CALL_DVS77
00:05:59,00 --> 00:06:04,50
Her arms around his neck, she shrugs coyly. 

THE_CALL_DVS78
00:06:03,00 --> 00:06:07,50
He gives her a sly smile. 

THE_CALL_DVS83
00:06:26,00 --> 00:06:31,50
Now, the woman returns to her desk. 

THE_CALL_DVS84
00:06:54,00 --> 00:07:00,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> smiles and accepts an incoming call. 

THE_CALL_DVS93
00:07:43,00 --> 00:07:51,50
A man reaches into the broken window as SOMEONE<Leah> goes to the stairs. SOMEONE<Jordan> rapidly types on her computer. 

THE_CALL_DVS109
00:08:20,00 --> 00:08:32,50
The intruder walks down the upstairs hall and opens one of the doors. As it swings shut behind him, the dark ominous figure stands frozen in a vestibule with an arched entry. 

THE_CALL_DVS110
00:08:34,00 --> 00:08:41,50
He goes to the archway and briefly surveys the room before kneeling at the foot of the bed. 

THE_CALL_DVS112
00:08:47,00 --> 00:08:52,50
Catching sight of his reflection in a mirror, 

THE_CALL_DVS113
00:08:50,00 --> 00:08:55,50
the prowler walks up to an open closet door. 

THE_CALL_DVS114
00:08:55,00 --> 00:09:01,50
He slowly pulls it closed as he checks behind it. 

THE_CALL_DVS116
00:09:00,00 --> 00:09:09,50
His face obscured by a ball cap, the menacing man turns. He heads toward a beaded curtain and parts it. 

THE_CALL_DVS117
00:09:09,00 --> 00:09:15,50
He returns to the vestibule and closes the door to the hall. 

THE_CALL_DVS118
00:09:12,00 --> 00:09:17,50
Pausing, he slowly goes back into the room. 

THE_CALL_DVS119
00:09:15,00 --> 00:09:21,50
From the archway, he spies a French window that stands ajar. 

THE_CALL_DVS120
00:09:18,00 --> 00:09:24,50
The intruder rushes to it and steps onto a small balcony. 

THE_CALL_DVS121
00:09:22,00 --> 00:09:27,50
A pair of flip flops lies on the ground below. 

THE_CALL_DVS122
00:09:25,00 --> 00:09:33,50
He rushes inside and leaves the bedroom as our view shifts to SOMEONE<Leah>, who lies under the bed behind a large box. 

THE_CALL_DVS123
00:09:45,00 --> 00:09:49,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> exhales deeply. 

THE_CALL_DVS124
00:09:50,00 --> 00:09:55,50
The phone disconnects. 

THE_CALL_DVS125
00:09:53,00 --> 00:09:57,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> hits the redial button. 

THE_CALL_DVS127
00:10:02,00 --> 00:10:07,50
He looks up toward the second floor. 

THE_CALL_DVS128
00:10:11,00 --> 00:10:15,50
SOMEONE<Leah> lies still under the bed. 

THE_CALL_DVS129
00:10:21,00 --> 00:10:25,50
SOMEONE's<Jordan's> eyes widen. 

THE_CALL_DVS130
00:10:23,00 --> 00:10:30,50
In the bedroom, SOMEONE<Leah> holds the phone to her ear and quivers in the darkness. 

THE_CALL_DVS135
00:11:01,00 --> 00:11:07,50
SOMEONE's<Jordan's> glistening eyes dart. She brings a hand to her headset. 

THE_CALL_DVS136
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:18,50
SOMEONE's<Jordan's> boss watches her from across the room. 

THE_CALL_DVS137
00:11:17,00 --> 00:11:24,50
At the house, the man holds SOMEONE<Leah> down with a latex-gloved hand. 

THE_CALL_DVS140
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:35,50
SOMEONE's<Jordan's> eyes dart about frantically. She turns to her coworker. 

THE_CALL_DVS141
00:11:34,00 --> 00:11:39,50
A message on her screen flashes. Call disconnected. 

THE_CALL_DVS142
00:11:37,00 --> 00:11:41,50
She rises and rushes out. 

THE_CALL_DVS144
00:11:40,00 --> 00:11:47,50
She opens a door marked Quiet Room and bursts in on a lounging coworker. 

THE_CALL_DVS145
00:11:44,00 --> 00:11:50,50
Blurry-eyed, she puts a hand on her temple and looks away from him. 

THE_CALL_DVS146
00:11:50,00 --> 00:11:57,50
The man leaves and shuts the door. SOMEONE<Jordan> grips her head with both hands, pacing. 

THE_CALL_DVS147
00:11:54,00 --> 00:12:00,50
Her boss enters the room and she turns to face her. 

THE_CALL_DVS148
00:12:08,00 --> 00:12:13,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> shrugs and shakes her head. 

THE_CALL_DVS149
00:12:24,00 --> 00:12:29,50
She steps past her boss and leaves the room. 

THE_CALL_DVS150
00:12:27,00 --> 00:12:33,50
The stern-faced woman stares at the door and takes a heavy breath. 

THE_CALL_DVS151
00:12:30,00 --> 00:12:38,50
Now, SOMEONE<Leah> lies on her back. A bare hand caresses a lock of hair pressed against her neck. 

THE_CALL_DVS152
00:12:36,00 --> 00:12:41,50
The hand grips her chin and a finger passes over her mouth. 

THE_CALL_DVS153
00:12:39,00 --> 00:12:45,50
A bloody mouth fills our view. 

THE_CALL_DVS154
00:12:44,00 --> 00:12:48,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> wakes with a start. 

THE_CALL_DVS155
00:12:46,00 --> 00:12:52,50
A shadowy figure stands at a window in her door. 

THE_CALL_DVS156
00:12:56,00 --> 00:13:00,50
She puts her face in her hands. 

THE_CALL_DVS157
00:12:58,00 --> 00:13:02,50
SOMEONE<Phillips> stands outside. 

THE_CALL_DVS158
00:13:02,00 --> 00:13:07,50
She slowly gets out of bed. 

THE_CALL_DVS159
00:13:11,00 --> 00:13:16,50
She passes a framed photo of a police officer. 

THE_CALL_DVS163
00:13:21,00 --> 00:13:25,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> drives. 

THE_CALL_DVS164
00:13:30,00 --> 00:13:34,50
She reaches for the radio dial. 

THE_CALL_DVS165
00:13:32,00 --> 00:13:40,50
Now on the main floor of the call center, SOMEONE's<Jordan's> boss stands behind a bank of monitors with her hands on her hips. 

THE_CALL_DVS166
00:13:38,00 --> 00:13:44,50
The young operator walks by SOMEONE<Marco>, who looks up from his desk. 

THE_CALL_DVS167
00:13:41,00 --> 00:13:49,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> gazes listlessly around the busy room and makes her way to her workstation. 

THE_CALL_DVS168
00:13:46,00 --> 00:13:54,50
Her chest heaves as she looks over the cluster of monitors, keyboard, and audio controls before her. 

THE_CALL_DVS169
00:13:51,00 --> 00:13:57,50
She slowly sits and rests a hand next to her keyboard. 

THE_CALL_DVS171
00:13:57,00 --> 00:14:02,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> turns to her coworker. 

THE_CALL_DVS172
00:13:59,00 --> 00:14:05,50
She nods to her friend and they both face their terminals. 

THE_CALL_DVS174
00:14:06,00 --> 00:14:16,50
Facing the screens, she relaxes her shoulders. She stares at the main display and the green Ready icon in the center of the interface. 

THE_CALL_DVS175
00:14:18,00 --> 00:14:23,50
The green icon changes color. 

THE_CALL_DVS176
00:14:21,00 --> 00:14:26,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> stares at the now red Not Ready icon. 

THE_CALL_DVS177
00:14:24,00 --> 00:14:29,50
Her hand hovers over the space bar on her keyboard. 

THE_CALL_DVS178
00:14:26,00 --> 00:14:30,50
She looks down at it. 

THE_CALL_DVS184
00:14:56,00 --> 00:15:01,50
The icon turns green. 

THE_CALL_DVS185
00:14:59,00 --> 00:15:03,50
She shuts her eyes. 

THE_CALL_DVS186
00:15:02,00 --> 00:15:06,50
She opens them and exhales. 

THE_CALL_DVS187
00:15:05,00 --> 00:15:10,50
Another call comes in and she hits the space bar. 

THE_CALL_DVS188
00:15:17,00 --> 00:15:21,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> looks back. 

THE_CALL_DVS189
00:15:18,00 --> 00:15:24,50
Her coworker stands and stares with her gaze fixed ahead. 

THE_CALL_DVS190
00:15:22,00 --> 00:15:27,50
The young operator bolts out of her chair. 

THE_CALL_DVS191
00:15:24,00 --> 00:15:32,50
On a large monitor, she watches aerial news footage of investigators unearthing a corpse. 

THE_CALL_DVS193
00:15:31,00 --> 00:15:37,50
Kidnap victim's body found in Lancaster. 

THE_CALL_DVS194
00:15:34,00 --> 00:15:40,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> looks at the pixelated form lying on a black tarp. 

THE_CALL_DVS195
00:15:39,00 --> 00:15:44,50
Now on the sunlit roof of the call center. 

THE_CALL_DVS196
00:15:41,00 --> 00:15:46,50
She leans on a cement ledge. 

THE_CALL_DVS197
00:15:43,00 --> 00:15:48,50
Officer SOMEONE<Phillips> goes to her. 

THE_CALL_DVS198
00:15:48,00 --> 00:15:54,50
He joins her at the edge of the building and looks at her tenderly. 

THE_CALL_DVS199
00:15:58,00 --> 00:16:05,50
Resting her chin in her hand and keeping her eyes on the city, she nods. 

THE_CALL_DVS200
00:16:32,00 --> 00:16:38,50
She tilts her head toward her boyfriend and looks at him with glistening eyes. 

THE_CALL_DVS203
00:16:48,00 --> 00:16:52,50
She nods. 

THE_CALL_DVS204
00:16:49,00 --> 00:16:56,50
SOMEONE<Phillips> looks into her eyes, then steps back and leaves SOMEONE<Jordan> by the edge of the roof. 

THE_CALL_DVS205
00:16:53,00 --> 00:16:59,50
She rubs her face and sets her chin between her hands. 

THE_CALL_DVS211
00:17:17,00 --> 00:17:21,50
Words appear. Six months later. 

THE_CALL_DVS213
00:17:20,00 --> 00:17:27,50
Now, patrons ride an escalator in the center of an indoor sunlit mall. 

THE_CALL_DVS214
00:17:26,00 --> 00:17:34,50
On the lower level, children ride a miniature train around a display of oversized lollipops. 

THE_CALL_DVS215
00:17:31,00 --> 00:17:37,50
Amid the shoppers, two teenage girls ride up the escalator. 

THE_CALL_DVS216
00:18:03,00 --> 00:18:08,50
Autumn pulls out a second phone. 

THE_CALL_DVS217
00:18:24,00 --> 00:18:29,50
Smiling, Autumn's blond friend shakes her head. 

THE_CALL_DVS218
00:18:32,00 --> 00:18:39,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Jordan> dumps a prescription pill into her hand by a running bathroom faucet. 

THE_CALL_DVS219
00:18:36,00 --> 00:18:43,50
She sips water from a clear plastic cup and thrusts back her head as she swallows. 

THE_CALL_DVS220
00:18:41,00 --> 00:18:46,50
With her eyes closed, she leans on the sink. 

THE_CALL_DVS221
00:18:43,00 --> 00:18:49,50
The words Training Unit stand out on her button up shirt. 

THE_CALL_DVS223
00:18:48,00 --> 00:18:52,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> gazes at herself. 

THE_CALL_DVS224
00:18:49,00 --> 00:18:56,50
Later, she places the pill bottle beside several others at a locker. 

THE_CALL_DVS225
00:18:53,00 --> 00:19:00,50
She eyes a newspaper clipping for Leah Templeton's memorial taped inside the door. 

THE_CALL_DVS226
00:18:59,00 --> 00:19:05,50
Now in a conference room, SOMEONE<Jordan> faces a table of trainees. 

THE_CALL_DVS228
00:19:34,00 --> 00:19:40,50
Now, she leads them through the facility. 

THE_CALL_DVS241
00:20:09,00 --> 00:20:14,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> stops and turns. 

THE_CALL_DVS252
00:20:56,00 --> 00:21:01,50
They gaze down at the bustling main floor. 

THE_CALL_DVS255
00:21:39,00 --> 00:21:44,50
Stopping, Autumn points at her friend. 

THE_CALL_DVS256
00:21:44,00 --> 00:21:49,50
She smiles and shakes her head as Autumn hurries off. 

THE_CALL_DVS257
00:21:49,00 --> 00:21:56,50
Sitting alone, the young blond sips her fountain drink and gazes across the court. 

THE_CALL_DVS259
00:21:56,00 --> 00:22:02,50
From behind a pillar, we watch her put her purse on her shoulder and collect a few shopping bags. 

THE_CALL_DVS260
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:07,50
The blond sips her drink, then finds Autumn's prepaid track phone on the table. 

THE_CALL_DVS261
00:22:06,00 --> 00:22:11,50
She grabs the phone and stands, looking after Autumn. 

THE_CALL_DVS262
00:22:12,00 --> 00:22:19,50
Smiling, the blond shakes her head and slides the phone into her back pocket. 

THE_CALL_DVS263
00:22:17,00 --> 00:22:23,50
Now she strolls through a quiet parking garage. 

THE_CALL_DVS264
00:22:35,00 --> 00:22:41,50
She keeps her eyes on the phone. A sedan almost backs into her. 

THE_CALL_DVS270
00:22:59,00 --> 00:23:04,50
Her body falls limp and he drags her to the sedan. 

THE_CALL_DVS271
00:23:02,00 --> 00:23:09,50
In the hive, SOMEONE<Jordan> leads her trainees to a young woman's workstation. 

THE_CALL_DVS272
00:23:35,00 --> 00:23:40,50
SOMEONE<Josh> glances at his trainer. 

THE_CALL_DVS273
00:24:02,00 --> 00:24:06,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> stares at SOMEONE<Josh>. 

THE_CALL_DVS275
00:24:15,00 --> 00:24:22,50
Now, a bit of light sneaks through a round car speaker and lands on the blonde's face. 

THE_CALL_DVS276
00:24:19,00 --> 00:24:25,50
Her closed eyelids quiver as her head slightly jolts about. 

THE_CALL_DVS277
00:24:26,00 --> 00:24:33,50
Opening her eyes, the dazed teen faces the interior of a car's trunk. 

THE_CALL_DVS278
00:24:30,00 --> 00:24:34,50
Her eyes shift about. 

THE_CALL_DVS279
00:24:32,00 --> 00:24:37,50
Slowly blinking, the blond rolls her head to the side. 

THE_CALL_DVS280
00:24:34,00 --> 00:24:40,50
A soft red light glows on her cheek from one of the tail lights. 

THE_CALL_DVS281
00:24:41,00 --> 00:24:46,50
The young blond quickly glances around. 

THE_CALL_DVS282
00:24:44,00 --> 00:24:49,50
Realizing her location, she presses her hands to the roof, 

THE_CALL_DVS288
00:24:54,00 --> 00:25:00,50
then frantically bangs on the pulsating speaker. 

THE_CALL_DVS291
00:25:05,00 --> 00:25:12,50
The kidnapper casually taps the wheel as he drives. 

THE_CALL_DVS295
00:25:17,00 --> 00:25:26,50
As she hits a button, light shines on her face. She sees a new voice mail from Raul and immediately dials 911. 

THE_CALL_DVS299
00:25:30,00 --> 00:25:35,50
In the hive, SOMEONE<Jordan> faces her trainees. 

THE_CALL_DVS302
00:25:46,00 --> 00:25:51,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> stops her trainees behind Brooke's station. 

THE_CALL_DVS303
00:25:55,00 --> 00:26:00,50
The trainees observe as SOMEONE<Jordan> puts on a headset. 

THE_CALL_DVS308
00:26:36,00 --> 00:26:42,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> searches the room for her boss and spots her on a phone call. 

THE_CALL_DVS316
00:26:56,00 --> 00:27:02,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> waves Brooke up and takes her place, putting on the headset. 

THE_CALL_DVS323
00:27:50,00 --> 00:27:54,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> looks to her boss. 

THE_CALL_DVS326
00:28:18,00 --> 00:28:22,50
The boss faces Brooke. 

THE_CALL_DVS371
00:30:09,00 --> 00:30:13,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> shifts her gaze. 

THE_CALL_DVS384
00:30:43,00 --> 00:30:54,50
On a mountain, a red and white cell tower overlooks the sprawling valley. Congested traffic flows along a wide freeway below. 

THE_CALL_DVS385
00:30:54,00 --> 00:31:02,50
The maroon sedan speeds beneath an overpass, moving easily with other cars in light traffic. 

THE_CALL_DVS401
00:31:31,00 --> 00:31:36,50
SOMEONE's<Jordan's> boss approaches. 

THE_CALL_DVS407
00:31:50,00 --> 00:32:08,50
From overhead, the maroon sedan speeds along the freeway. The kidnapper reaches for the radio. He cranks the volume as SOMEONE<Casey> struggles in the trunk. She pries off the tail light's back cover, then grabs a short-handled paint roller. 

THE_CALL_DVS426
00:33:12,00 --> 00:33:17,50
Now, a call comes in to SOMEONE's<Marco's> station. 

THE_CALL_DVS433
00:33:33,00 --> 00:33:38,50
SOMEONE<Marco> enters the plate in their system. 

THE_CALL_DVS463
00:34:50,00 --> 00:34:55,50
Moving a tarp, her eyes widen. 

THE_CALL_DVS465
00:35:30,00 --> 00:35:36,50
Slowly closing her eyes, the scared teen presses her lips tight. 

THE_CALL_DVS466
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:14,50
An industrial rail yard full of motionless freight trains rests beside the large boulevard. The kidnapper drives along as SOMEONE<Casey> pries open a paint can with a screw driver. 

THE_CALL_DVS478
00:36:43,00 --> 00:36:51,50
A search chopper soars overhead. 

THE_CALL_DVS479
00:36:53,00 --> 00:37:04,50
Approaching a large intersection, the kidnapper slows to a stop in the left turn lane. A thick patch of white paint beneath the right tail light hole drips onto the street. 

THE_CALL_DVS480
00:37:06,00 --> 00:37:10,50
The kidnapper stretches his neck. 

THE_CALL_DVS481
00:37:08,00 --> 00:37:13,50
The man stopped next to him lowers his window. 

THE_CALL_DVS482
00:37:14,00 --> 00:37:23,50
With his shaggy hair slicked back, the suited driver points toward the rear tail light. The kidnapper rolls down his passenger window. 

THE_CALL_DVS484
00:37:25,00 --> 00:37:31,50
The kidnapper stares at the driver, then glances back. 

THE_CALL_DVS485
00:37:29,00 --> 00:37:36,50
He peers into the side mirror, then gives the good Samaritan a thumbs up. 

THE_CALL_DVS487
00:37:41,00 --> 00:37:50,50
Facing forward, the kidnapper's jaw trembles. His teeth clink together as he fixates on the red stop light. 

THE_CALL_DVS490
00:37:51,00 --> 00:37:59,50
His large sunglasses rest on the center of his nose, exposing his dark, narrow eyes. 

THE_CALL_DVS491
00:37:56,00 --> 00:38:02,50
SOMEONE<Casey> uncaps the other paint can and moves it to the hole. 

THE_CALL_DVS492
00:38:00,00 --> 00:38:05,50
She carefully tilts the can with both hands. 

THE_CALL_DVS493
00:38:02,00 --> 00:38:09,50
Glancing over, the suited driver watches the mysterious man as the light turns. 

THE_CALL_DVS500
00:38:21,00 --> 00:38:56,50
She desperately wipes the phone. The kidnapper screeches to a halt in an empty parking lot and marches to the trunk. He glares down at the busted tail light and patch of white paint. SOMEONE's<Casey's> mouth hangs open as she eyes the hole. Lowering the phone, she slips it into her back pocket. The kidnapper chuckles. The frightened teen arms herself with the screw driver. 

THE_CALL_DVS508
00:39:10,00 --> 00:39:17,50
He aims the screw driver at her eye then runs his fingers along her paint-stained hair. 

THE_CALL_DVS509
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:24,50
Clenching his teeth, the kidnapper slams the trunk. 

THE_CALL_DVS518
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:52,50
Turning, he sees the suited driver beside his town car and tucks the bottle into his back pocket. 

THE_CALL_DVS519
00:40:07,00 --> 00:40:12,50
He presses the screw driver to SOMEONE's<Casey's> cheek. 

THE_CALL_DVS520
00:40:16,00 --> 00:40:22,50
Leaning over the trunk, the kidnapper smiles at the driver. 

THE_CALL_DVS521
00:40:19,00 --> 00:40:24,50
A tear slides down SOMEONE's<Casey's> cheek. 

THE_CALL_DVS522
00:40:25,00 --> 00:40:30,50
Turning, the driver heads to his car. 

THE_CALL_DVS523
00:40:28,00 --> 00:40:35,50
He stops and glances back, then continues forward as the kidnapper looks up from the trunk. 

THE_CALL_DVS524
00:40:33,00 --> 00:40:37,50
He gives the driver a friendly wave. 

THE_CALL_DVS525
00:40:39,00 --> 00:40:44,50
The driver puts his hands on the wheel and turns his head. 

THE_CALL_DVS526
00:40:42,00 --> 00:40:49,50
Adjusting the side mirror, he watches the kidnapper aggressively dig at something in the trunk. 

THE_CALL_DVS527
00:40:48,00 --> 00:40:54,50
With his brow tensed, the suited driver retrieves his cellphone. 

THE_CALL_DVS528
00:40:51,00 --> 00:40:57,50
He dials 911, keeping his gaze straight ahead. 

THE_CALL_DVS529
00:40:59,00 --> 00:41:05,50
The kidnapper shatters the window with a shovel. 

THE_CALL_DVS533
00:41:21,00 --> 00:41:27,50
The kidnapper bashes the driver's head and stands glaring at the motionless body. 

THE_CALL_DVS535
00:41:27,00 --> 00:41:33,50
The enraged man starts off, then turns as the helpless driver crawls away. 

THE_CALL_DVS539
00:41:39,00 --> 00:41:44,50
Backing away, he drops the shovel and turns. 

THE_CALL_DVS541
00:41:45,00 --> 00:41:51,50
The kidnapper removes a handful of glass shards from his back pocket. 

THE_CALL_DVS542
00:41:49,00 --> 00:41:53,50
They fall from his trembling hand. 

THE_CALL_DVS543
00:41:51,00 --> 00:41:56,50
He shifts an anxious gaze between his trunk and the body. 

THE_CALL_DVS546
00:42:04,00 --> 00:42:11,50
Ripping off his blood-stained shirt, he wipes blood from his undershirt and tosses it down. 

THE_CALL_DVS547
00:42:09,00 --> 00:42:14,50
The killer faces the sedan with his mouth hanging open. 

THE_CALL_DVS548
00:42:11,00 --> 00:42:17,50
The terrified teen keeps her eyes on the roof. 

THE_CALL_DVS549
00:42:14,00 --> 00:42:20,50
Frozen in place, his frenzied gaze softens on the trunk. 

THE_CALL_DVS555
00:42:32,00 --> 00:42:40,50
Holding her headset, SOMEONE<Jordan> shifts her wide, frantic eyes to the GPS locator screen. 

THE_CALL_DVS558
00:42:41,00 --> 00:42:46,50
From overhead, we narrow in on the parking lot. 

THE_CALL_DVS560
00:42:49,00 --> 00:42:58,50
Now, two squad cars speed toward the abandoned sedan and screech to a halt. 

THE_CALL_DVS562
00:42:59,00 --> 00:43:05,50
With their guns aimed, the officers rush toward the sedan. 

THE_CALL_DVS564
00:43:04,00 --> 00:43:10,50
Moving to the trunk, SOMEONE<Phillips> nods to SOMEONE<Jake> and he swings it open. 

THE_CALL_DVS565
00:43:07,00 --> 00:43:12,50
Only paint supplies remain. 

THE_CALL_DVS567
00:43:21,00 --> 00:43:27,50
Phillips' eyes shift from the glass shards to a large blood stain. 

THE_CALL_DVS571
00:43:49,00 --> 00:43:54,50
The kidnapper's face calms as he stares straight ahead. 

THE_CALL_DVS572
00:43:52,00 --> 00:43:58,50
SOMEONE<Casey> lies inside the trunk with the driver's body pressed against her back. 

THE_CALL_DVS573
00:43:56,00 --> 00:44:05,50
Turning her head, she pushes his face off her shoulder and moves an arm from her torso then quickly retrieves the phone. 

THE_CALL_DVS580
00:45:08,00 --> 00:45:13,50
The driver ignites a lighter. 

THE_CALL_DVS588
00:45:41,00 --> 00:45:49,50
With his mouth hanging open, the killer lowers the body onto SOMEONE<Casey> and leans over the trunk. 

THE_CALL_DVS590
00:45:48,00 --> 00:45:55,50
He places a hand on the driver's face and yanks the screw driver from his flesh. 

THE_CALL_DVS591
00:45:53,00 --> 00:46:00,50
Clenching his jaw, the killer rips off the release lever and grabs the frightened teen. 

THE_CALL_DVS595
00:46:11,00 --> 00:46:16,50
SOMEONE's<Jordan's> eyes widen. 

THE_CALL_DVS599
00:46:24,00 --> 00:46:30,50
A female agent dusts for prints. 

THE_CALL_DVS602
00:46:34,00 --> 00:46:42,50
SOMEONE<Phillips> shares a look with his partner. Nodding, he turns away and notices something on the ground. 

THE_CALL_DVS603
00:46:40,00 --> 00:46:46,50
The officer removes his sunglasses and takes a few steps forward. 

THE_CALL_DVS605
00:46:44,00 --> 00:46:49,50
Crouching down, SOMEONE<Phillips> eyes the broken chloroform bottle. 

THE_CALL_DVS609
00:46:52,00 --> 00:46:59,50
From overhead, cars move along a curvy freeway cutting through mountains. 

THE_CALL_DVS610
00:46:56,00 --> 00:47:03,50
The kidnapper speeds down the adjacent two-lane surface street. 

THE_CALL_DVS611
00:47:01,00 --> 00:47:10,50
In the hive, SOMEONE<Jordan> stares at the GPS locator screen with no coordinates found. SOMEONE<Maddy> approaches. 

THE_CALL_DVS615
00:48:44,00 --> 00:48:48,50
SOMEONE's<Jordan's> eyes glisten. 

THE_CALL_DVS633
00:49:46,00 --> 00:49:51,50
She reaches into his breast pocket and removes a wallet. 

THE_CALL_DVS652
00:50:38,00 --> 00:50:44,50
Now, the kidnapper pulls into an empty gas station with old style pumps. 

THE_CALL_DVS653
00:50:42,00 --> 00:50:48,50
Hopping out, he approaches a chubby service attendant with some cash in hand. 

THE_CALL_DVS654
00:50:51,00 --> 00:50:56,50
He rushes back around the car and opens the gas cap. 

THE_CALL_DVS655
00:50:53,00 --> 00:50:59,50
Large sweat stains SOMEONE<mark> his chest and back. 

THE_CALL_DVS656
00:51:14,00 --> 00:51:19,50
The cell battery flashes red. 

THE_CALL_DVS657
00:51:21,00 --> 00:51:27,50
She aims the phone's light around the trunk and spots something. 

THE_CALL_DVS658
00:51:30,00 --> 00:51:35,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> shifts her anxious gaze. 

THE_CALL_DVS660
00:51:39,00 --> 00:51:48,50
The attendant shrugs and moves away. Sliding the phone into her pocket, SOMEONE<Casey> peels back a velcro flap. 

THE_CALL_DVS661
00:51:45,00 --> 00:51:51,50
The kidnapper anxiously eyes the pump's counters. 

THE_CALL_DVS664
00:51:53,00 --> 00:51:59,50
In the back seat, the center arm rest flops down. 

THE_CALL_DVS665
00:51:56,00 --> 00:52:03,50
Sticking her arms out first, SOMEONE<Casey> crawls through the small opening. 

THE_CALL_DVS666
00:52:00,00 --> 00:52:06,50
She squeezes her shoulders through and sees the kidnapper with his back turned. 

THE_CALL_DVS667
00:52:04,00 --> 00:52:11,50
To the right of the hood, the attendant opens boxes of motor oil with a box cutter. 

THE_CALL_DVS671
00:52:14,00 --> 00:52:21,50
The kidnapper keeps his eyes on the pump as SOMEONE<Casey> spots the man and desperately waves her arms. 

THE_CALL_DVS673
00:52:21,00 --> 00:52:26,50
Turning around, the murderer leans on the roof. 

THE_CALL_DVS674
00:52:23,00 --> 00:52:30,50
SOMEONE<Casey> grips the front seats and tries pulling her hips through the opening. 

THE_CALL_DVS676
00:52:34,00 --> 00:52:42,50
It cuts to the picture of SOMEONE<Casey> with descriptive features and details of the abduction. 

THE_CALL_DVS678
00:52:41,00 --> 00:52:45,50
The kidnapper's mouth falls open. 

THE_CALL_DVS687
00:53:01,00 --> 00:53:08,50
Glancing between them, the attendant whips out the box cutter. 

THE_CALL_DVS692
00:53:18,00 --> 00:53:27,50
The kidnapper glares through the window. SOMEONE<Casey> glances between them as the attendant reaches for the handle. 

THE_CALL_DVS697
00:53:42,00 --> 00:53:47,50
Flames instantly consume the attendant. 

THE_CALL_DVS698
00:53:44,00 --> 00:53:52,50
The kidnapper watches as the burning man flails about. Breaking his stare, the killer rushes to the trunk. 

THE_CALL_DVS707
00:54:10,00 --> 00:54:16,50
With her jaw trembling, SOMEONE<Jordan> shifts her desperate eyes. 

THE_CALL_DVS708
00:54:14,00 --> 00:54:21,50
Elsewhere, the police database finds a match for the kidnapper's print. 

THE_CALL_DVS712
00:54:26,00 --> 00:54:31,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> receives the call. 

THE_CALL_DVS715
00:54:38,00 --> 00:54:45,50
Her database searches briefly, then loads a smiling photo of the kidnapper. 

THE_CALL_DVS716
00:54:42,00 --> 00:54:47,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> glares at the image. 

THE_CALL_DVS721
00:54:56,00 --> 00:55:06,50
Three squad cars arrive at the target home. SOMEONE<Phillips> and his fellow officer hop out with their side arms drawn, rushing past toys in the front lawn. 

THE_CALL_DVS722
00:55:05,00 --> 00:55:12,50
SOMEONE<Phillips> goes in the front door. SOMEONE<Jake> finds SOMEONE's<Foster's> wife and kids in the kitchen. 

THE_CALL_DVS733
00:55:34,00 --> 00:55:38,50
He follows an officer. 

THE_CALL_DVS734
00:55:37,00 --> 00:55:41,50
SOMEONE<Jake> eyes the young children. 

THE_CALL_DVS735
00:55:42,00 --> 00:55:45,50
At the hive. 

THE_CALL_DVS740
00:55:54,00 --> 00:56:00,50
At SOMEONE's<Foster's> house, the officer leads SOMEONE<Phillips> upstairs. 

THE_CALL_DVS742
00:56:01,00 --> 00:56:06,50
He points to a wall of framed photos. 

THE_CALL_DVS744
00:56:05,00 --> 00:56:14,50
SOMEONE<Phillips> eyes photos of a beautiful, lively, blond teen. Several depict her and a smiling young boy. 

THE_CALL_DVS745
00:56:11,00 --> 00:56:19,50
In a glass display case, a light illuminates a portrait of the blond. He spots a poem titled My Sister. 

THE_CALL_DVS750
00:56:38,00 --> 00:56:45,50
SOMEONE<Phillips> closely examines a twirling ballerina inside a pink jewelry box. 

THE_CALL_DVS751
00:56:43,00 --> 00:56:49,50
On a secluded road, the town car rolls through a field. 

THE_CALL_DVS752
00:56:49,00 --> 00:56:56,50
From the other side of a grimy window lined with figurines, we watch the car slow to a stop. 

THE_CALL_DVS753
00:56:56,00 --> 00:57:04,50
SOMEONE<Foster> emerges from the car and pops the trunk. Through the window, we watch the killer pull SOMEONE<Casey> out. 

THE_CALL_DVS754
00:57:10,00 --> 00:57:17,50
Hefting her over one shoulder, SOMEONE<Foster> notices the cellphone in her back pocket. 

THE_CALL_DVS755
00:57:15,00 --> 00:57:20,50
He sees it's been connected for an hour and 28 minutes. 

THE_CALL_DVS756
00:57:22,00 --> 00:57:28,50
He lowers her to the ground, covers her mouth, and puts the phone to his ear. 

THE_CALL_DVS757
00:57:28,00 --> 00:57:33,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> stares wide-eyed at her computer screen. 

THE_CALL_DVS758
00:57:30,00 --> 00:57:36,50
SOMEONE's<Foster's> smiling DMV photo stares back. 

THE_CALL_DVS759
00:57:34,00 --> 00:57:40,50
Behind the car, he crouches over his victim with his mouth ajar. 

THE_CALL_DVS761
00:57:39,00 --> 00:57:44,50
SOMEONE's<Jordan's> mouth tenses and she wets her lips. 

THE_CALL_DVS766
00:57:59,00 --> 00:58:06,50
At the hive, SOMEONE<Maddy> listens to another phone and watches SOMEONE<Jordan>. 

THE_CALL_DVS771
00:58:15,00 --> 00:58:19,50
The trembling killer stares at the ground. 

THE_CALL_DVS772
00:58:22,00 --> 00:58:29,50
SOMEONE's<Jordan's> GPS locator still reads No location information. 

THE_CALL_DVS776
00:58:43,00 --> 00:58:48,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> remembers SOMEONE's<Leah's> phone call. 

THE_CALL_DVS778
00:58:46,00 --> 00:58:56,50
The call disconnects as a flashback shows SOMEONE<Foster> bringing a fist down toward SOMEONE<Leah>. 

THE_CALL_DVS779
00:58:53,00 --> 00:58:59,50
The GPS graphic disappears from SOMEONE's<Jordan's> screen. 

THE_CALL_DVS780
00:58:56,00 --> 00:59:02,50
She blinks her glistening eyes and takes a few ragged breaths. 

THE_CALL_DVS781
00:59:00,00 --> 00:59:06,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> tears off her headset, catching the attention of her coworker. 

THE_CALL_DVS783
00:59:17,00 --> 00:59:28,50
At SOMEONE's<Foster's> home, SOMEONE<Phillips> looks over a collection of photos on the wall. In one, a young SOMEONE<Foster> poses with his sister in front of a truck outside a house. 

THE_CALL_DVS784
00:59:33,00 --> 00:59:38,50
SOMEONE<Phillips> removes the photo from the wall. 

THE_CALL_DVS785
00:59:35,00 --> 00:59:40,50
In the kitchen, SOMEONE<Jake> interviews SOMEONE's<Foster's> wife. 

THE_CALL_DVS795
01:00:25,00 --> 01:00:30,50
She keeps her hand over her mouth. 

THE_CALL_DVS796
01:00:27,00 --> 01:00:32,50
SOMEONE<Phillips> reaches for his walkie. 

THE_CALL_DVS797
01:00:34,00 --> 01:00:38,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> runs a search. 

THE_CALL_DVS798
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:51,50
An officer approaches SOMEONE<Phillips> as he leaves with SOMEONE<Jake>. 

THE_CALL_DVS806
01:01:13,00 --> 01:01:19,50
With a concerned gaze, he stares off and lowers his walkie. 

THE_CALL_DVS808
01:01:17,00 --> 01:01:22,50
At the hive, SOMEONE<Jordan> reads articles on the SOMEONE<Leah> Templeton murder. 

THE_CALL_DVS809
01:01:20,00 --> 01:01:27,50
An aerial photo shows the blond teen's body stripped down in the desert with blood around her head. 

THE_CALL_DVS813
01:01:31,00 --> 01:01:37,50
A pair of lights illuminate the doorway of SOMEONE's<Foster's> childhood cottage. 

THE_CALL_DVS814
01:01:34,00 --> 01:01:42,50
One behind the other, several groups of officers stealthily approach from all sides, weapons drawn. 

THE_CALL_DVS815
01:01:40,00 --> 01:01:47,50
A SWAT team takes the lead and smashes the front door in with a battering ram. 

THE_CALL_DVS818
01:01:47,00 --> 01:01:57,50
In the hive, SOMEONE<Jordan> and her coworkers listen as the office ers move through the dark cottage. 

THE_CALL_DVS824
01:02:20,00 --> 01:02:26,50
As SOMEONE<Jordan> leaves her workstation, SOMEONE<Maddy> watches her go. 

THE_CALL_DVS825
01:02:23,00 --> 01:02:30,50
The frustrated operator walks into the break room with a hand on her forehead. 

THE_CALL_DVS826
01:02:27,00 --> 01:02:31,50
SOMEONE<Maddy> enters. 

THE_CALL_DVS827
01:03:03,00 --> 01:03:09,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> rolls her head, then gives SOMEONE<Maddy> a look and leaves. 

THE_CALL_DVS828
01:03:08,00 --> 01:03:12,50
Now darkness obscures our view. 

THE_CALL_DVS829
01:03:15,00 --> 01:03:23,50
Now, four wheels, the front two large and the back two tiny, roll across a dingy concrete floor. 

THE_CALL_DVS830
01:03:21,00 --> 01:03:27,50
SOMEONE<Casey> sits upright in a wheelchair, her left eye nearly swollen shut. 

THE_CALL_DVS831
01:03:25,00 --> 01:03:31,50
Her right eye shifts as SOMEONE<Foster> lowers the high chair back, creating a gurney. 

THE_CALL_DVS832
01:03:29,00 --> 01:03:34,50
He fills an old white sink with water, 

THE_CALL_DVS833
01:03:31,00 --> 01:03:38,50
then aligns a pair of metal scissors on a tray beside two combs. 

THE_CALL_DVS834
01:03:35,00 --> 01:03:40,50
SOMEONE<Foster> turns on a tank of nitric oxide. 

THE_CALL_DVS837
01:03:45,00 --> 01:03:49,50
Gripping the top of her head, he roughly keeps the mask in place. 

THE_CALL_DVS839
01:03:50,00 --> 01:03:54,50
Her resistance subsides. 

THE_CALL_DVS840
01:03:51,00 --> 01:04:05,50
Now, SOMEONE<Foster> cuts off her shirt, stripping her down to her bra. He removes her sandals and grips her ankles as she pulls away. Now, SOMEONE<Foster> lowers her head back over the lip of the sink and sprays down her hair. 

THE_CALL_DVS841
01:04:02,00 --> 01:04:09,50
As he massages her scalp with shampoo, he keeps his face close to hers. 

THE_CALL_DVS842
01:04:07,00 --> 01:04:12,50
Later, he holds his hand over her mouth, 

THE_CALL_DVS843
01:04:09,00 --> 01:04:14,50
then replaces it with a gas mask. 

THE_CALL_DVS844
01:04:11,00 --> 01:04:17,50
SOMEONE<Foster> presses it against her until she calms. 

THE_CALL_DVS845
01:04:17,00 --> 01:04:24,50
Now, the killer slides a cassette tape into an old boom box. 

THE_CALL_DVS846
01:04:28,00 --> 01:04:35,50
SOMEONE<Foster> springs SOMEONE's<Casey's> chair into the upright position and circles her with his hand on her head. 

THE_CALL_DVS849
01:04:36,00 --> 01:04:41,50
Sitting beside her, she looks away as he takes a comb off the tray. 

THE_CALL_DVS850
01:04:39,00 --> 01:04:45,50
The disturbed man gently combs her hair in front of her face. 

THE_CALL_DVS851
01:04:42,00 --> 01:04:50,50
SOMEONE<Casey> tries squeezing her left hand out from the thick restraint strap as SOMEONE<Foster> trims a little of her hair. 

THE_CALL_DVS852
01:04:48,00 --> 01:04:55,50
Her hair still in her face, SOMEONE<Casey> cringes as SOMEONE<Foster> strokes her cheeks. 

THE_CALL_DVS853
01:04:52,00 --> 01:04:57,50
He brushes the hair away from her right eye. 

THE_CALL_DVS854
01:05:03,00 --> 01:05:10,50
SOMEONE<Foster> flashes a tight smile as SOMEONE<Casey> stares with a horrified gaze. 

THE_CALL_DVS856
01:05:08,00 --> 01:05:14,50
The killer turns away and SOMEONE<Casey> squeezes her left hand free from the wrist restraint. 

THE_CALL_DVS859
01:05:18,00 --> 01:05:24,50
He falls back and she frees her other hand. 

THE_CALL_DVS860
01:05:21,00 --> 01:05:26,50
The teen hurries into a narrow dark hallway. 

THE_CALL_DVS862
01:05:28,00 --> 01:05:34,50
In the hall, SOMEONE<Casey> reaches a dead end and backtracks. 

THE_CALL_DVS865
01:05:43,00 --> 01:05:50,50
She turns the lock and rests her head, then spots something across the room. 

THE_CALL_DVS866
01:05:47,00 --> 01:05:52,50
SOMEONE<Foster> trudges toward the door. 

THE_CALL_DVS867
01:05:51,00 --> 01:05:56,50
She steps forward, her jaw hanging slack. 

THE_CALL_DVS869
01:05:56,00 --> 01:06:02,50
SOMEONE<Foster> breaks through the door and grabs her, covering her mouth. 

THE_CALL_DVS872
01:06:06,00 --> 01:06:15,50
Now, an officer patrols the hive as several workstations lie quiet and vacant. 

THE_CALL_DVS873
01:06:12,00 --> 01:06:18,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> sits at her desk working a recorder's controls. 

THE_CALL_DVS875
01:06:50,00 --> 01:06:55,50
She lifts her head from her hand and her eyes widen. 

THE_CALL_DVS876
01:06:59,00 --> 01:07:04,50
She rewinds the recording. 

THE_CALL_DVS877
01:07:11,00 --> 01:07:18,50
She stops the track and adjusts the audio levels, then replays the recording with her eyes closed. 

THE_CALL_DVS878
01:07:37,00 --> 01:07:45,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> tosses off her headset and covers her eyes. At a road block, SOMEONE<Phillips> instructs officers. 

THE_CALL_DVS880
01:07:57,00 --> 01:08:01,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> looks around the hive. 

THE_CALL_DVS882
01:08:24,00 --> 01:08:29,50
He hangs up and approaches a line of cars. 

THE_CALL_DVS883
01:08:29,00 --> 01:08:36,50
At her desk, SOMEONE<Jordan> removes her cell from her ear and lowers her thoughtful gaze. 

THE_CALL_DVS884
01:08:34,00 --> 01:08:38,50
Holding the phone against her chin, 

THE_CALL_DVS885
01:08:36,00 --> 01:08:42,50
she chews her fingertip and looks at a map of the Santa Clarita hills. 

THE_CALL_DVS886
01:08:39,00 --> 01:08:45,50
She glances over her shoulder.  

THE_CALL_DVS887
01:08:46,00 --> 01:08:52,50
She looks down at her watch. SOMEONE<Jordan> taps her thumbnail against the watch face. 

THE_CALL_DVS888
01:08:49,00 --> 01:08:57,50
Glancing back up to her monitor, she finds SOMEONE's<Casey's> profile with a smiling photo. 

THE_CALL_DVS889
01:08:54,00 --> 01:08:59,50
Her eyes dart and she rises from her chair. 

THE_CALL_DVS891
01:09:02,00 --> 01:09:07,50
A single car's headlights cut through the darkness. 

THE_CALL_DVS892
01:09:05,00 --> 01:09:09,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> drives. 

THE_CALL_DVS893
01:09:09,00 --> 01:09:14,50
A police cruiser passes in the opposite direction. 

THE_CALL_DVS894
01:09:11,00 --> 01:09:17,50
Another follows, coming down the mountain road. 

THE_CALL_DVS897
01:09:20,00 --> 01:09:25,50
Later, she parks her car on a dirt road. 

THE_CALL_DVS898
01:09:28,00 --> 01:09:34,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> shuts off her car and stays seated. 

THE_CALL_DVS899
01:09:31,00 --> 01:09:36,50
The car faces SOMEONE's<Foster's> childhood cottage. 

THE_CALL_DVS900
01:09:34,00 --> 01:09:39,50
Three porch lights illuminate the exterior. 

THE_CALL_DVS901
01:09:36,00 --> 01:09:43,50
Now, SOMEONE<Jordan> slowly pushes the front door open and shines a flashlight inside. 

THE_CALL_DVS902
01:09:43,00 --> 01:09:47,50
She hits a light switch, which turns on a single lamp that barely sheds light on the room. 

THE_CALL_DVS904
01:09:47,00 --> 01:09:53,50
Our view spies on her through an inner door opened a crack. 

THE_CALL_DVS905
01:09:50,00 --> 01:09:58,50
SOMEONE's<Jordan's> flashlight beam finds a couch and settles briefly on a big wheel tricycle. 

THE_CALL_DVS907
01:09:57,00 --> 01:10:01,50
On the fireplace mantle, she finds family photographs, including ones of SOMEONE<Foster> and his kids. 

THE_CALL_DVS910
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:08,50
From behind the door, we watch as she moves the flashlight across the mantle. 

THE_CALL_DVS911
01:10:05,00 --> 01:10:12,50
Our view lingers on the operator, then ducks back as she turns toward us. 

THE_CALL_DVS912
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:17,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> spots an open doorway and moves into the next room. 

THE_CALL_DVS914
01:10:15,00 --> 01:10:20,50
In the corner, plastic sheets cover old furniture. 

THE_CALL_DVS915
01:10:17,00 --> 01:10:23,50
She finds a step ladder with three paint cans at its base. 

THE_CALL_DVS916
01:10:21,00 --> 01:10:28,50
Moving through the space, she enters another room filled with boxed belongings. 

THE_CALL_DVS917
01:10:25,00 --> 01:10:31,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> aims her flashlight at the boxes and singles one out. 

THE_CALL_DVS919
01:10:30,00 --> 01:10:36,50
She pulls the flaps open and finds it packed with medical equipment. 

THE_CALL_DVS920
01:10:34,00 --> 01:10:40,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> picks up a green rubber glove, then drops it disgustedly. 

THE_CALL_DVS921
01:10:44,00 --> 01:10:50,50
Looking away, she finds another box filled with trophies and photos. 

THE_CALL_DVS922
01:10:47,00 --> 01:10:54,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> removes a framed picture of SOMEONE's<Foster's> beautiful blond sister. 

THE_CALL_DVS923
01:10:51,00 --> 01:10:59,50
In it, the lively teen poses on her belly, chin in her hands and ankles crossed up behind her. 

THE_CALL_DVS924
01:10:57,00 --> 01:11:01,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> digs deeper into the box. 

THE_CALL_DVS926
01:11:01,00 --> 01:11:06,50
The operator pulls out a photo album. 

THE_CALL_DVS927
01:11:03,00 --> 01:11:10,50
Flipping through it, she finds photos of the young loving siblings. 

THE_CALL_DVS928
01:11:08,00 --> 01:11:16,50
She studies another portrait of the grinning blond, then finds an envelope with more pictures. 

THE_CALL_DVS929
01:11:16,00 --> 01:11:24,50
In the first photo, the teen girl sits in the wheelchair gurney wearing a hospital gown. 

THE_CALL_DVS930
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:27,50
Only the slightest remnants of hair remain on her head. 

THE_CALL_DVS931
01:11:26,00 --> 01:11:32,50
SOMEONE compares the picture to SOMEONE's sister's portrait, 

THE_CALL_DVS932
01:11:29,00 --> 01:11:34,50
which shows off her thick blond hair. 

THE_CALL_DVS933
01:11:32,00 --> 01:11:40,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> shuffles through more photos showing the sickly girl with her brother at her bedside. 

THE_CALL_DVS934
01:11:39,00 --> 01:11:45,50
At the end of the stack, she finds a photo of the boy kissing his sister. 

THE_CALL_DVS935
01:11:45,00 --> 01:11:50,50
Her lips parted, SOMEONE<Jordan> looks away. 

THE_CALL_DVS936
01:11:49,00 --> 01:11:57,50
Now, SOMEONE<Jordan> exits the cottage and stares out into the darkness with the flashlight at her side. 

THE_CALL_DVS937
01:12:05,00 --> 01:12:12,50
She turns her head, then steps off the low wooden front porch and heads for her car. 

THE_CALL_DVS938
01:12:13,00 --> 01:12:18,50
She stops and furrows her brow. 

THE_CALL_DVS939
01:12:18,00 --> 01:12:23,50
She turns alertly, listening. 

THE_CALL_DVS940
01:12:29,00 --> 01:12:36,50
Now, SOMEONE<Jordan> shines her flashlight as she traverses a path through a small field. 

THE_CALL_DVS941
01:12:34,00 --> 01:12:40,50
She walks astride a row of bushes and approaches a flag pole. 

THE_CALL_DVS942
01:12:38,00 --> 01:12:43,50
The snap hooks at the end of the cable sway against the pole. 

THE_CALL_DVS944
01:12:45,00 --> 01:12:49,50
the flag flapping in the breeze. 

THE_CALL_DVS946
01:12:48,00 --> 01:12:54,50
Lowering the flashlight, she looks at the snap hooks then surveys the surrounding area. 

THE_CALL_DVS947
01:12:52,00 --> 01:12:58,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> turns away from the underbrush and goes deeper into the field. 

THE_CALL_DVS948
01:12:59,00 --> 01:13:07,50
She carefully sidesteps as she lowers the flashlight and discovers a small black object in the dirt. 

THE_CALL_DVS949
01:13:05,00 --> 01:13:11,50
Bending over, she picks up a piece of SOMEONE's<Casey's> disposable phone. 

THE_CALL_DVS950
01:13:12,00 --> 01:13:16,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> glances up thoughtfully. 

THE_CALL_DVS951
01:13:14,00 --> 01:13:20,50
She rubs the broken face of the phone and drops it back on the ground. 

THE_CALL_DVS952
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:24,50
Catching sight of something, she digs around in the dirt and dry grass. 

THE_CALL_DVS954
01:13:24,00 --> 01:13:30,50
Brushing away, she peels back a flap of material to reveal an inset handle. 

THE_CALL_DVS955
01:13:28,00 --> 01:13:34,50
She shines her light over it and examines the small grip. 

THE_CALL_DVS956
01:13:32,00 --> 01:13:39,50
With her free hand, she grabs the handle and yanks on it, 

THE_CALL_DVS957
01:13:36,00 --> 01:13:40,50
lifting a wide hatch. 

THE_CALL_DVS959
01:13:40,00 --> 01:13:48,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> shines her flashlight into the hole and sees a metal ladder leading down several feet. 

THE_CALL_DVS960
01:13:46,00 --> 01:13:50,50
Looking up, she scans the field. 

THE_CALL_DVS961
01:13:48,00 --> 01:13:54,50
She switches the light to her other hand and reaches into her back pocket. 

THE_CALL_DVS962
01:13:52,00 --> 01:13:59,50
Taking out her phone, she fumbles with it over the hole and drops it. 

THE_CALL_DVS963
01:13:58,00 --> 01:14:03,50
The phone lands face up at the foot of the ladder. 

THE_CALL_DVS964
01:14:01,00 --> 01:14:06,50
The screen displays a flashing message. 

THE_CALL_DVS965
01:14:03,00 --> 01:14:07,50
SOMEONE stares down at it, 

THE_CALL_DVS966
01:14:05,00 --> 01:14:11,50
then slowly lifts her head and looks toward the dimly lit cabin. 

THE_CALL_DVS967
01:14:08,00 --> 01:14:13,50
She turns her gaze back to the opening. 

THE_CALL_DVS968
01:14:13,00 --> 01:14:19,50
She leans forward and sets her hand on the open hatch. 

THE_CALL_DVS970
01:14:18,00 --> 01:14:23,50
Putting a foot on the ladder, SOMEONE<Jordan> descends into the underground chamber. 

THE_CALL_DVS971
01:14:20,00 --> 01:14:27,50
As she lowers herself, she hesitantly lets go of the hatch. 

THE_CALL_DVS972
01:14:26,00 --> 01:14:34,50
The operator carefully climbs down the ladder to the floor and looks at her phone. 

THE_CALL_DVS973
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:36,50
An icon flashes with the words No signal. 

THE_CALL_DVS974
01:14:39,00 --> 01:14:47,50
She looks deeper into the chamber as she picks up her phone and swings her flashlight around to survey a narrow hallway. 

THE_CALL_DVS975
01:14:53,00 --> 01:15:00,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> hesitantly steps down the hall and inspects the underground structure. 

THE_CALL_DVS976
01:15:02,00 --> 01:15:09,50
Rounding a corner, she faces a wall with an exposed wooden frame. 

THE_CALL_DVS977
01:15:06,00 --> 01:15:12,50
Turning left, she spies a white door with a deadbolt. 

THE_CALL_DVS978
01:15:11,00 --> 01:15:19,50
She moves to her right and sees a white plastic lawn chair with a work light hung above it. 

THE_CALL_DVS979
01:15:16,00 --> 01:15:21,50
Shutting her flashlight off, 

THE_CALL_DVS981
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:30,50
Haphazardly nailed slats of wood crisscross the openings between support beams. 

THE_CALL_DVS983
01:15:34,00 --> 01:15:42,50
She passes into a low-ceilinged room bisected by the crumbling wooden skeleton of a wall. 

THE_CALL_DVS985
01:15:41,00 --> 01:15:49,50
As she steps forward, the woman cautiously puts out a hand and lightly leans on a dingy wooden partition. 

THE_CALL_DVS986
01:15:46,00 --> 01:15:52,50
She looks at a light shining through a half open door. 

THE_CALL_DVS988
01:15:52,00 --> 01:15:59,50
She retreats as SOMEONE<Foster> appears in the door crack and heads in her direction. 

THE_CALL_DVS989
01:15:56,00 --> 01:16:02,50
He holds a torn shirt and cloth and tosses them down. 

THE_CALL_DVS990
01:16:00,00 --> 01:16:06,50
Now, SOMEONE<Jordan> scurries back through the white door and shuts it, pressing herself against it. 

THE_CALL_DVS993
01:16:06,00 --> 01:16:13,50
SOMEONE<Foster> stares off, then picks up a large bucket and goes back to the well-lit room. 

THE_CALL_DVS994
01:16:10,00 --> 01:16:16,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> hunches against the door in the darkness, then looks around. 

THE_CALL_DVS995
01:16:21,00 --> 01:16:27,50
She turns on her flashlight and peers at the wall to her right. 

THE_CALL_DVS996
01:16:24,00 --> 01:16:33,50
A small green chair sits next to an open wardrobe and a small crystal chandelier hangs over the room. 

THE_CALL_DVS997
01:16:30,00 --> 01:16:36,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> steps farther into the space and fixes her gaze. 

THE_CALL_DVS998
01:16:34,00 --> 01:16:40,50
Her eyes widening, the 911 operator stands frozen. 

THE_CALL_DVS999
01:16:40,00 --> 01:16:46,50
She hides as SOMEONE<Foster> enters. 

THE_CALL_DVS1000
01:16:45,00 --> 01:16:51,50
He flips on a light and paces tensely around the space. 

THE_CALL_DVS1001
01:16:49,00 --> 01:16:55,50
The sweaty killer's gaze darts wildly about. 

THE_CALL_DVS1002
01:16:52,00 --> 01:16:57,50
He stares downward by the door and stills himself. 

THE_CALL_DVS1003
01:16:55,00 --> 01:17:00,50
SOMEONE<Foster> glances up and across the room. 

THE_CALL_DVS1004
01:17:01,00 --> 01:17:09,50
As he walks away from the door, our view shifts to reveal a pink twin bed covered in blood. 

THE_CALL_DVS1006
01:17:11,00 --> 01:17:17,50
SOMEONE<Foster> looks at the grim sight and softly smiles. 

THE_CALL_DVS1007
01:17:14,00 --> 01:17:19,50
He goes to a mirrored vanity. 

THE_CALL_DVS1008
01:17:16,00 --> 01:17:22,50
On it, a wig form wears straight, flaxen hair. 

THE_CALL_DVS1009
01:17:24,00 --> 01:17:28,50
On the other side of the room, 

THE_CALL_DVS1010
01:17:25,00 --> 01:17:31,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> hides behind the open door of the wardrobe. 

THE_CALL_DVS1011
01:17:28,00 --> 01:17:35,50
She watches SOMEONE<Foster> tensely through the thin crack between the hinges. 

THE_CALL_DVS1013
01:17:33,00 --> 01:17:39,50
Leaning forward, she sees him with his ring finger in his mouth. 

THE_CALL_DVS1015
01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:43,50
He slides his finger from his lips, leaving his wedding ring between his teeth. 

THE_CALL_DVS1016
01:17:41,00 --> 01:17:49,50
SOMEONE<Foster> takes it out of his mouth and places it on the finger of a white mannequin hand sitting on the vanity. 

THE_CALL_DVS1018
01:17:48,00 --> 01:17:52,50
He stares at the wig form. 

THE_CALL_DVS1019
01:17:50,00 --> 01:17:56,50
Behind it sits a childhood photo of SOMEONE<Foster> and his sister. 

THE_CALL_DVS1021
01:17:55,00 --> 01:18:00,50
His mouth quivering, the killer gazes at the mannequin's impassive face. 

THE_CALL_DVS1022
01:18:03,00 --> 01:18:09,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> spies him through the crack as he picks up the mannequin head. 

THE_CALL_DVS1023
01:18:06,00 --> 01:18:14,50
SOMEONE<Foster> holds it close to his face with one hand and sits on the bed with his back to SOMEONE<Jordan>. 

THE_CALL_DVS1024
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:18,50
He caresses the hair tenderly, then pulls it off of the head. 

THE_CALL_DVS1025
01:18:15,00 --> 01:18:22,50
A dried red drip of blood remains on the mannequin forehead. 

THE_CALL_DVS1026
01:18:19,00 --> 01:18:24,50
SOMEONE<Foster> examines the interior of the wig. 

THE_CALL_DVS1027
01:18:22,00 --> 01:18:30,50
SOMEONE's<Jordan's> mouth falls open as she sees the gory scalp underneath the long blond hair in his hands. 

THE_CALL_DVS1028
01:18:27,00 --> 01:18:34,50
She watches him press his face into the hair and inhale deeply. 

THE_CALL_DVS1029
01:18:32,00 --> 01:18:38,50
SOMEONE<Foster> falls back on the bed with the scalp on top of his face. 

THE_CALL_DVS1030
01:18:38,00 --> 01:18:44,50
SOMEONE's<Jordan's> eye stares fixedly from the narrow space behind the door. 

THE_CALL_DVS1031
01:18:43,00 --> 01:18:47,50
SOMEONE<Foster> lifts the hair and inspects it. 

THE_CALL_DVS1033
01:18:46,00 --> 01:18:51,50
Turning it over, he pulls out a thin purple extension. 

THE_CALL_DVS1034
01:18:48,00 --> 01:18:54,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> balks. He tosses it aside. 

THE_CALL_DVS1041
01:19:01,00 --> 01:19:08,50
He throws the hair into a mini fridge with several other bagged scalps. 

THE_CALL_DVS1042
01:19:05,00 --> 01:19:11,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> shifts her gaze and discovers SOMEONE<Foster> absent from her view. 

THE_CALL_DVS1043
01:19:08,00 --> 01:19:14,50
She turns slightly and the agitated killer appears. 

THE_CALL_DVS1044
01:19:12,00 --> 01:19:16,50
He stares intently in her direction. 

THE_CALL_DVS1045
01:19:14,00 --> 01:19:21,50
SOMEONE<Foster> takes a few measured steps towards the wardrobe, his shirt soaked with sweat. 

THE_CALL_DVS1046
01:19:19,00 --> 01:19:24,50
Coming within inches of the hidden woman, 

THE_CALL_DVS1047
01:19:21,00 --> 01:19:28,50
he turns to face the hanging clothes and sets his hand on top of the open door. 

THE_CALL_DVS1048
01:19:25,00 --> 01:19:34,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> shuts her mouth in a tight SOMEONE<grimace> while SOMEONE<Foster> closes his eyes and smells the contents of the wardrobe. 

THE_CALL_DVS1055
01:19:36,00 --> 01:19:53,50
His fingers hang over the thin door above SOMEONE<Jordan>. She eyes them while SOMEONE<Foster> buries his face in his shirt sleeve. SOMEONE<Foster> abruptly turns away and looks at the wig form on the bed. 

THE_CALL_DVS1057
01:19:59,00 --> 01:20:05,50
The lights in the room go out. SOMEONE<Jordan> puts her hand over her mouth. 

THE_CALL_DVS1066
01:20:21,00 --> 01:20:27,50
SOMEONE<Phillips> hangs up and faces the officers leaning over SOMEONE's<Alan's> body. 

THE_CALL_DVS1068
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:34,50
SOMEONE's<Foster's> upside down face peers down beside it. 

THE_CALL_DVS1069
01:20:31,00 --> 01:20:36,50
His image blurs then refocuses. 

THE_CALL_DVS1072
01:20:37,00 --> 01:20:44,50
Standing behind the wheelchair, SOMEONE<Foster> leans over SOMEONE<Casey>, who wears a shower cap on her head and the gas mask over her mouth and nose. 

THE_CALL_DVS1073
01:20:42,00 --> 01:20:47,50
He adjusts the chair into its reclined position. 

THE_CALL_DVS1074
01:20:46,00 --> 01:20:53,50
A tube from SOMEONE's<Casey's> mask leads to the nitric oxide tank. 

THE_CALL_DVS1075
01:20:50,00 --> 01:20:56,50
SOMEONE<Foster> grabs a large black bucket and sets it down next to SOMEONE<Casey>. 

THE_CALL_DVS1076
01:20:54,00 --> 01:21:01,50
He carefully stuffs loose locks of her flaxen hair into the clear plastic shower cap. 

THE_CALL_DVS1078
01:20:59,00 --> 01:21:05,50
He places his hands on either side of SOMEONE's<Casey's> head. 

THE_CALL_DVS1079
01:21:03,00 --> 01:21:07,50
The teen shuts her eyes. 

THE_CALL_DVS1080
01:21:04,00 --> 01:21:10,50
SOMEONE<Foster> goes across the room and retrieves a pair of latex gloves. 

THE_CALL_DVS1083
01:21:24,00 --> 01:21:30,50
He removes the sheath from a scalpel. 

THE_CALL_DVS1084
01:21:27,00 --> 01:21:34,50
The killer pulls back SOMEONE's<Casey's> shower cap, revealing a dotted marker line on her forehead. 

THE_CALL_DVS1091
01:21:45,00 --> 01:21:52,50
He cuts into her forehead. 

THE_CALL_DVS1095
01:21:58,00 --> 01:22:09,50
SOMEONE<Foster> collapses as SOMEONE<Jordan> whacks his head with the wig form. He turns to her and she bashes him again. She stands over him and breaks the ceramic head over his. 

THE_CALL_DVS1096
01:22:06,00 --> 01:22:12,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> runs to SOMEONE<Casey> and looks over the shirtless and bruised captive. 

THE_CALL_DVS1097
01:22:12,00 --> 01:22:18,50
She removes her mask and shower cap and holds her face. 

THE_CALL_DVS1100
01:22:43,00 --> 01:23:03,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> turns to see SOMEONE<Foster> behind her. He charges and tackles her to the ground. With his gloved hands, he picks her up by the collar and slams her into the wall. He drags the struggling woman across the room. She pulls away with all her might and SOMEONE<Foster> takes her head and shoves it into the utility sink full of water. 

THE_CALL_DVS1101
01:23:00,00 --> 01:23:12,50
He holds her down as her body tenses and bucks. SOMEONE<Jordan> fights for her life and briefly comes up for air before SOMEONE<Foster> submerges her head again. 

THE_CALL_DVS1102
01:23:10,00 --> 01:23:15,50
She screams underwater. 

THE_CALL_DVS1103
01:23:12,00 --> 01:23:19,50
SOMEONE<Casey> looks at her wrists, then at SOMEONE<Foster>, his back turned to the wakening girl. 

THE_CALL_DVS1104
01:23:18,00 --> 01:23:23,50
SOMEONE's<Jordan's> face slackens and her body begins to relax. 

THE_CALL_DVS1105
01:23:21,00 --> 01:23:27,50
SOMEONE<Foster> stoops over her as her struggling weakens. 

THE_CALL_DVS1108
01:23:31,00 --> 01:23:38,50
SOMEONE<Casey> stands pointing a pair of surgical scissors at her kidnapper. 

THE_CALL_DVS1110
01:23:38,00 --> 01:23:44,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> takes a step back as SOMEONE<Foster> rises to face them. 

THE_CALL_DVS1111
01:23:41,00 --> 01:23:48,50
She sees a deep gash running from between his eyebrows down his right cheek. 

THE_CALL_DVS1118
01:24:17,00 --> 01:24:25,50
Pulling herself out of the hole, she staggers away from it with SOMEONE<Foster> close behind. 

THE_CALL_DVS1119
01:24:22,00 --> 01:24:32,50
He stands up, his eyes locking on the escaping woman before him. 

THE_CALL_DVS1120
01:24:30,00 --> 01:24:35,50
He arches his back and winces. 

THE_CALL_DVS1121
01:24:32,00 --> 01:24:37,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> slows her pace and turns around. 

THE_CALL_DVS1122
01:24:34,00 --> 01:24:39,50
SOMEONE<Foster> looks behind him, facing SOMEONE<Casey>. 

THE_CALL_DVS1123
01:24:41,00 --> 01:24:49,50
Our view shifts down behind SOMEONE<Foster> to the surgical scissors protruding from his lower back. 

THE_CALL_DVS1124
01:24:46,00 --> 01:24:54,50
SOMEONE<Casey> watches nervously as he grips the scissor handle and slowly yanks the instrument out of his body. 

THE_CALL_DVS1125
01:24:52,00 --> 01:24:57,50
He raises the bloody blades to eye level. 

THE_CALL_DVS1127
01:24:59,00 --> 01:25:03,50
He looks at SOMEONE<Casey>. 

THE_CALL_DVS1128
01:25:01,00 --> 01:25:12,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> delivers a high kick to his back and he falls halfway through the hatch. The killer desperately fights to find perches on the ground as he dangles over the hole. 

THE_CALL_DVS1132
01:25:19,00 --> 01:25:24,50
She and SOMEONE<Jordan> peer down at the unconscious man. 

THE_CALL_DVS1133
01:25:25,00 --> 01:25:31,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> looks over the hole at SOMEONE<Casey>, who stands shivering. 

THE_CALL_DVS1134
01:25:28,00 --> 01:25:33,50
She stares wide-eyes at her rescuer. 

THE_CALL_DVS1135
01:25:31,00 --> 01:25:38,50
The operator searches her pockets and pulls her phone out of her jeans. 

THE_CALL_DVS1136
01:25:35,00 --> 01:25:41,50
She activates the screen and dials 911. 

THE_CALL_DVS1137
01:25:42,00 --> 01:25:48,50
She looks up at the young girl, who shifts her eyes down to the open hatch. 

THE_CALL_DVS1138
01:25:46,00 --> 01:25:51,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> follows SOMEONE's<Casey's> gaze. 

THE_CALL_DVS1139
01:25:48,00 --> 01:25:55,50
SOMEONE looks up again, her bruised left eye almost swollen shut, 

THE_CALL_DVS1140
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:57,50
a deep laceration marring her forehead. 

THE_CALL_DVS1141
01:25:54,00 --> 01:26:00,50
The two survivors exchange a knowing look. 

THE_CALL_DVS1143
01:26:06,00 --> 01:26:11,50
His sweaty head sags against his chest. 

THE_CALL_DVS1144
01:26:08,00 --> 01:26:13,50
He sits up and blinks several times. 

THE_CALL_DVS1146
01:26:11,00 --> 01:26:18,50
He catches sight of duct tape binding his wrists to the wheelchair. 

THE_CALL_DVS1147
01:26:15,00 --> 01:26:20,50
A thick chain circles his torso. 

THE_CALL_DVS1148
01:26:17,00 --> 01:26:24,50
SOMEONE<Foster> fights to free himself from the chair in his own makeshift operating room. 

THE_CALL_DVS1152
01:26:31,00 --> 01:26:37,50
He turns as SOMEONE<Jordan> and SOMEONE<Casey> come into view. 

THE_CALL_DVS1154
01:26:39,00 --> 01:26:45,50
He squints slightly and scrutinizes SOMEONE's<Jordan's> face. 

THE_CALL_DVS1157
01:26:48,00 --> 01:26:53,50
She stares him down and nods. 

THE_CALL_DVS1164
01:27:07,00 --> 01:27:12,50
SOMEONE<Jordan> turns to SOMEONE<Casey>. 

THE_CALL_DVS1170
01:27:19,00 --> 01:27:25,50
She leans in close to the killer's face. 

THE_CALL_DVS1178
01:27:42,00 --> 01:27:47,50
He looks at her pleadingly.
