THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS51
00:03:19,00 --> 00:03:24,50
Now, in reality. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS52
00:03:21,00 --> 00:03:28,50
The rugged man descends courthouse stairs and encounters several journalists. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS53
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:38,50
They follow outside. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS54
00:03:40,00 --> 00:03:44,50
He walks off in the rain. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS55
00:03:58,00 --> 00:04:02,50
Later he enters a coffee shop. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS56
00:04:05,00 --> 00:04:09,50
He takes a seat. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS57
00:04:11,00 --> 00:04:18,50
Dawning glasses he peruses a file as the news broadcasts behind him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS58
00:04:21,00 --> 00:04:27,50
He whirls around to watch Wennerstrom's statement. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS59
00:04:44,00 --> 00:04:53,50
The barista sets the items on the counter. Later SOMEONE<Blomkvist> stands outside in the shelter of the coffee shops entryway. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS60
00:04:51,00 --> 00:04:58,50
He opens the Marlboros, puts one between his lips and throws the rest of the pack away. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS61
00:04:56,00 --> 00:05:00,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> lights the cigarette, then takes a deep satisfied drag. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS64
00:05:01,00 --> 00:05:09,50
The journalist runs across the street to a building. A sign near its entrance reads Millennium. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS65
00:05:06,00 --> 00:05:13,50
Inside, he arrives at a suite door bearing the same title. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS66
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:16,50
As he enters, a staff of employees halt and face him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS67
00:05:15,00 --> 00:05:27,50
He shrugs his brow grimly and goes upstairs to an office. Inside, a lovely blonde in her 40s steps away from her desk and regards him sympathetically. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS68
00:05:29,00 --> 00:05:35,50
A staffer arrives, but the woman sends him away with a gesture. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS69
00:05:33,00 --> 00:05:39,50
As SOMEONE<Blomkvist> steps further in, she shuts the door. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS70
00:05:53,00 --> 00:05:59,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> meets her gaze and his expression softens wearily. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS71
00:06:02,00 --> 00:06:09,50
His colleague steps close and intimately nuzzles her forehead against his. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS72
00:06:10,00 --> 00:06:18,50
Now a bespectacled old man waits in a conference room with a stylish businessman. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS73
00:06:21,00 --> 00:06:27,50
Outside, a woman wearing a helmet arrives on a motorcycle. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS74
00:06:36,00 --> 00:06:40,50
Sporting a Mohawk, she rides an elevator. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS75
00:06:52,00 --> 00:07:01,50
Spikes with spiraled ends impale her earlobes. Using keycards she passes purposefully through a series of doors. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS76
00:06:59,00 --> 00:07:09,50
She hesitates seeing the two men in the glass walled room. She sports eyebrow, nose, and lip rings amid her delicate features. Her boss waves her in. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS77
00:07:11,00 --> 00:07:21,50
Both men stand. Dressed in black with a matching leather jacket she enters avoiding their gaze and takes a seat at the far end of the conference table. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS78
00:07:18,00 --> 00:07:24,50
She sits hunched, turned slightly away. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS79
00:07:32,00 --> 00:07:36,50
She faces SOMEONE<Frode>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS80
00:07:36,00 --> 00:07:42,50
She turns away, giving him a full view of her black spikey Mohawk. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS81
00:08:39,00 --> 00:08:45,50
SOMEONE<Frode> faces SOMEONE<Salander> who wearily meets his gaze. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS82
00:08:53,00 --> 00:08:58,50
She stares through darkly lined eyes. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS83
00:08:57,00 --> 00:09:05,50
Now, in a working class high-rise she dumps packaged noodles into a bowl. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS84
00:09:02,00 --> 00:09:08,50
A cigarette dangles from her lips. As she runs the bowl under a tap. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS85
00:09:05,00 --> 00:09:10,50
She thrusts it into a microwave oven, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS86
00:09:07,00 --> 00:09:12,50
then takes a can of coke from her fridge. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS87
00:09:11,00 --> 00:09:15,50
Heading into the next room. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS88
00:09:12,00 --> 00:09:17,50
SOMEONE<Salander> sits facing a laptop. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS89
00:09:15,00 --> 00:09:23,50
She goes to a Vanger Industries page profiling SOMEONE<Frode>, then hacks into SOMEONE's<Blomkvist's> email account. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS90
00:09:23,00 --> 00:09:29,50
As SOMEONE<Salander> goes back to the kitchen, a new email pops up. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS91
00:09:27,00 --> 00:09:31,50
We glimpse its content. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS92
00:09:28,00 --> 00:09:36,50
Dear Mr. SOMEONE<Blomkvist>, Are you available for an interview regarding the Wennerstrom verdict?

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS93
00:09:33,00 --> 00:09:40,50
Returning with her steaming noodles, SOMEONE<Salander> runs a Google search on Wennerstrom. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS94
00:09:37,00 --> 00:09:46,50
It leads her to a Wikipedia page. SOMEONE<Salander> Googles Wennerstrom + Vanger Industries. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS95
00:09:43,00 --> 00:09:49,50
A webpage mentions his previous work in the financial division. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS96
00:09:48,00 --> 00:09:56,50
Now, at a Christmas gathering, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> faces his lover, her husband and a brunette. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS97
00:10:11,00 --> 00:10:18,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> notices a teen with dark hair watching him. He joins her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS98
00:10:23,00 --> 00:10:29,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> takes an uneasy breath and sips red wine. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS100
00:10:28,00 --> 00:10:34,50
Now, in a coat and knit hat, SOMEONE<Salander> lights a cigarette as she walks down a sidewalk. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS101
00:10:31,00 --> 00:10:37,50
She pauses within earshot of a building entrance. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS102
00:10:34,00 --> 00:10:41,50
Listening as a richly dressed older woman punches in an entry code. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS103
00:10:41,00 --> 00:10:47,50
As the woman goes in, SOMEONE<Salander> loiters briefly. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS104
00:10:44,00 --> 00:10:50,50
The ends of her black hair stick out from under her hat. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS105
00:10:47,00 --> 00:10:52,50
Framing her jaw and chin. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS106
00:10:49,00 --> 00:10:55,50
SOMEONE<Salander> goes to the keypad, enters the code, and goes inside. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS108
00:10:54,00 --> 00:11:00,50
She pauses, looking around, then climbs a marble staircase to a posted directory. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS109
00:10:58,00 --> 00:11:04,50
As the steps away we find Wennerstrom listed on the sixth level. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS110
00:11:02,00 --> 00:11:09,50
Now, SOMEONE<Salander> enters a basement area with rough stonewalls. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS111
00:11:06,00 --> 00:11:14,50
She comes to the building's electrical center and photographs the circuit boxes, meters, and wiring. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS113
00:11:12,00 --> 00:11:17,50
she takes a photo of an Ethernet hub. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS115
00:11:15,00 --> 00:11:20,50
she steps back out onto the sidewalk. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS116
00:11:18,00 --> 00:11:23,50
She turns abruptly as a car pulls up. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS117
00:11:20,00 --> 00:11:26,50
Looking over her shoulder, she spies Wennerstrom getting out. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS118
00:11:23,00 --> 00:11:30,50
As he takes out a cellphone, SOMEONE<Salander> continues down the sidewalk. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS119
00:11:30,00 --> 00:11:36,50
At the gathering, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> finds SOMEONE<Neila> and her mother at a table. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS120
00:11:47,00 --> 00:11:52,50
SOMEONE<Neila> checks her cell phone then puts it down. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS121
00:11:50,00 --> 00:11:55,50
Throughout the party, other guests do the same. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS122
00:11:52,00 --> 00:11:58,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> checks his own phone then answers it. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS123
00:12:46,00 --> 00:12:54,50
Now, sleeping beneath a white comforter, SOMEONE's<Blomkvist's> co-editor awakes alone in bed. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS124
00:12:51,00 --> 00:12:56,50
She lifts her head then gets up. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS125
00:12:53,00 --> 00:12:59,50
Revealing an oversized shirt with a hem just below her hips. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS126
00:12:56,00 --> 00:13:02,50
She finds SOMEONE<Blomkvist> at a laptop in the next room. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS127
00:13:07,00 --> 00:13:13,50
Sitting in his briefs, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> turns to face her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS128
00:13:22,00 --> 00:13:26,50
She steps away. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS129
00:13:23,00 --> 00:13:28,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> slams his computer shut. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS130
00:13:26,00 --> 00:13:33,50
Now in a blizzard, a train travels a mountainous snow dusted landscape. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS131
00:13:30,00 --> 00:13:39,50
In a passenger car set with small tables, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> sits opposite two strangers. His gaze pensive. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS132
00:13:36,00 --> 00:13:41,50
He rolls his head against his seatback. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS133
00:13:38,00 --> 00:13:43,50
Watching trees pass the window. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS135
00:13:41,00 --> 00:13:46,50
the train stops at a platform marked, SOMEONE disembarks. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS138
00:13:47,00 --> 00:13:52,50
Shivering, he walks to the edge of the platform. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS139
00:13:49,00 --> 00:13:55,50
Waiting beside a nearby car, SOMEONE<Frode> waves. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS141
00:13:54,00 --> 00:14:02,50
Now, on a narrow snow smeared road, the car approaches a bridge with rainbow-shaped arches barely wide enough for two cars. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS142
00:14:18,00 --> 00:14:26,50
The snow picks up again as the car turns down a road bordered with tall skeletal trees. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS143
00:14:23,00 --> 00:14:29,50
As SOMEONE<Frode> drives the journalist over the grounds of an estate. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS144
00:14:26,00 --> 00:14:32,50
The blizzard drives a heavy snowfall almost sideways. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS145
00:14:29,00 --> 00:14:36,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> leans forward peering through the windshield with narrowed eyes. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS147
00:14:34,00 --> 00:14:40,50
In the distance, twin lights barely pierce the storm on either side of the road. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS148
00:14:40,00 --> 00:14:46,50
The car passes through a gate set with glowing lamps. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS149
00:14:43,00 --> 00:14:49,50
Then approaches a sprawling elegant manor house with a circular driveway. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS150
00:14:47,00 --> 00:14:53,50
As it pulls up next to a utilitarian pickup with a covered bed, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS151
00:14:50,00 --> 00:14:57,50
the distinguished figure of SOMEONE<Henrik> Vanger comes outside to greet them. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS152
00:15:04,00 --> 00:15:11,50
SOMEONE<Henrik> takes them into a cozy study and gestures SOMEONE<Blomkvist> to a leather armchair. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS153
00:15:12,00 --> 00:15:17,50
The journalist sits facing his host. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS154
00:15:22,00 --> 00:15:27,50
With a friendly pat, SOMEONE<Henrik> dismisses SOMEONE<Frode>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS155
00:16:20,00 --> 00:16:27,50
Now, a heavyset techie in a Nine Inch Nails shirt lets SOMEONE<Salander> into his apartment. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS156
00:16:30,00 --> 00:16:36,50
She hands him some money and he examines it. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS157
00:16:38,00 --> 00:16:47,50
She holds out her hand to take it back but he instead gives her an electronic device with a screen, antenna, and attached wire. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS158
00:16:44,00 --> 00:16:50,50
SOMEONE<Salander> glances at the heavyset techie, then walks out the door. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS159
00:16:50,00 --> 00:16:57,50
She eyes him and shuts the door. A flashback shows a young woman on the beach. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS160
00:16:56,00 --> 00:17:00,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> studies a photo. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS162
00:18:13,00 --> 00:18:19,50
SOMEONE<Henrik> removes a school photo from an album. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS163
00:18:25,00 --> 00:18:30,50
SOMEONE<Henrik> stares at the photo. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS164
00:18:37,00 --> 00:18:42,50
In a flashback, children play outside the house. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS165
00:19:16,00 --> 00:19:22,50
A young blonde woman follows Harriet upstairs. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS166
00:19:22,00 --> 00:19:28,50
Outside, most of the adults all look in the same direction. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS167
00:19:30,00 --> 00:19:35,50
A two-vehicle pileup blocks the island bridge. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS168
00:19:58,00 --> 00:20:02,50
Fuel leaks from a tank. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS169
00:20:05,00 --> 00:20:12,50
A maid sees Harriet step outside. Young SOMEONE<Henrik> sits the bloody driver back. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS170
00:20:20,00 --> 00:20:25,50
Young SOMEONE<Martin> puts on a prep school blazer. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS171
00:20:39,00 --> 00:20:46,50
The tycoon and journalist sip their drinks. Later, they walk a hall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS172
00:21:03,00 --> 00:21:08,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> follows SOMEONE<Henrik> upstairs. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS173
00:21:19,00 --> 00:21:23,50
They enter an attic. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS174
00:21:31,00 --> 00:21:37,50
He switches on a shadeless lamp then gestures to a wall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS175
00:21:39,00 --> 00:21:48,50
SOMEONE<Henrik> views more than a dozen pressed and framed wildflowers, mounted meticulously on a wall in a tidy grid. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS176
00:21:46,00 --> 00:21:51,50
A second grid of the artwork covers another wall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS177
00:21:48,00 --> 00:21:54,50
And several unmounted frames lean on the wall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS178
00:21:59,00 --> 00:22:05,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> returns his gaze to the wildflowers. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS179
00:22:03,00 --> 00:22:09,50
A train leaves Hedestad station where a clock reads 4:30. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS180
00:22:06,00 --> 00:22:11,50
Later, at dinner with SOMEONE<Henrik>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS181
00:22:26,00 --> 00:22:30,50
SOMEONE<Henrik> pours wine. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS182
00:23:27,00 --> 00:23:33,50
He sips his wine. SOMEONE's<Blomkvist's> jaw hangs slack. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS183
00:23:34,00 --> 00:23:41,50
Now, pedestrians cross paths outside SOMEONE's<Wennerstrom’s> apartment building. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS184
00:23:39,00 --> 00:23:43,50
In the rough stone basement, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS185
00:23:40,00 --> 00:23:45,50
holding a flashlight between her teeth, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS186
00:23:42,00 --> 00:23:49,50
SOMEONE<Salander> sets her handheld device on top of an electrical box. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS187
00:23:46,00 --> 00:23:51,50
Then connects its wire to a circuit. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS188

He walks out the door. She watches him go with a disappointed gaze. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS197
00:24:48,00 --> 00:24:55,50
Now, at a coffee shop SOMEONE<Salander> sits alone at a counter with a book decorated with a bow.

She sets it down and glances around. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS201
00:25:02,00 --> 00:25:11,50

00:40:51,00 --> 00:40:59,50
He, SOMEONE<Martin>, and SOMEONE<Liv> clink wine glasses. Their reflections visible in the pristine full-length windows. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS331
00:40:57,00 --> 00:41:01,50
Now, at SOMEONE's<Palmgren’s>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS332
00:40:58,00 --> 00:41:05,50
A caretaker removes a tray from the table in front of the blank faced man. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS333
00:41:02,00 --> 00:41:10,50
Sitting diagonally beside her former guardian, SOMEONE<Salander> wipes drool from his mouth with her sleeve. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS334
00:41:15,00 --> 00:41:22,50
As she watches him, SOMEONE's<Palmgren’s> absent stare remains ahead. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS335
00:41:21,00 --> 00:41:25,50
The young woman looks away. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS336
00:41:23,00 --> 00:41:31,50
Later, she rides an escalator down into a subway station. A train glides up. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS337
00:41:28,00 --> 00:41:35,50
As she approaches the platform a guy snatches her backpack off her shoulder. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS338
00:41:32,00 --> 00:41:37,50
She sees him racing to the escalator. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS340
00:41:35,00 --> 00:41:41,50
As he rides up, SOMEONE<Salander> sprints after him and grabs her bag. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS341
00:41:38,00 --> 00:41:43,50
She and the thief tug it back and forth 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS342
00:41:40,00 --> 00:41:46,50
fighting for control, and she punches him in the face. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS343
00:41:43,00 --> 00:41:48,50
He falls to the escalator's gliding steps. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS344
00:41:46,00 --> 00:41:52,50
Grabbing him by the lapels she leans over him, her face contorted with rage. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS345
00:41:55,00 --> 00:42:00,50
The thief grabs the bag again and she kicks him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS346
00:41:57,00 --> 00:42:05,50
As he reaches for her she rolls onto the inclined metal barrier between the ascending and descending escalators. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS347
00:42:03,00 --> 00:42:09,50
Letting her pack slide down the ramp she jumps onto the descending escalator. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS348
00:42:07,00 --> 00:42:13,50
At the bottom she grabs the bag and races on to a train. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS349
00:42:10,00 --> 00:42:14,50
Its doors close behind her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS351
00:42:13,00 --> 00:42:20,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> finds a blonde with aristocratic features at his door. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS352
00:42:22,00 --> 00:42:26,50
He stares. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS353
00:42:27,00 --> 00:42:32,50
She steps into the cottage and he closes the door. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS354
00:42:34,00 --> 00:42:39,50
Her gaze fixes on the family tree in the living room. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS355
00:42:36,00 --> 00:42:45,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> watches as she moves closer, her shrewd eyes scanning the photos and facts on each family member. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS356
00:43:55,00 --> 00:43:59,50
She heads off. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS357
00:44:07,00 --> 00:44:13,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> watches her leave then gives a frustrated look. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS358
00:44:10,00 --> 00:44:16,50
Now, SSOMEONE's<Salander’s> laptop sits on a tech support counter. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS359
00:44:16,00 --> 00:44:21,50
Its shattered screen shows a blinking question SOMEONE<mark>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS360
00:44:22,00 --> 00:44:26,50
She takes the computer back. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS361
00:44:24,00 --> 00:44:30,50
Now, an office building's windows glow below a darkening sky. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS362
00:44:30,00 --> 00:44:36,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Salander> passes a janitor waxing the floor. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS363
00:44:37,00 --> 00:44:42,50
She strides through a vacant reception area. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS364
00:44:42,00 --> 00:44:47,50
She peers into an office. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS365
00:44:46,00 --> 00:44:52,50
Sitting across from her new guardian, she gives an affronted look. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS366
00:45:06,00 --> 00:45:12,50
A picture of the guardian's family rests on his desk. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS367
00:45:13,00 --> 00:45:18,50
He rises and moves to the front of his desk. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS368
00:45:19,00 --> 00:45:27,50
As he sits on the edge facing her, SOMEONE<Salander> anxiously shifts in her seat and avoids looking at him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS369
00:45:32,00 --> 00:45:38,50
As he stares down at her she continues to avoid his gaze. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS370
00:45:36,00 --> 00:45:41,50
He reaches toward her backpack, which sits in her lap. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS371
00:45:38,00 --> 00:45:43,50
As she withdraws her hands from it 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS372
00:45:40,00 --> 00:45:46,50
he lifts the bag away and then lets it drop. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS373
00:45:43,00 --> 00:45:48,50
SOMEONE<Salander> flinches as it hits the floor. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS374
00:45:49,00 --> 00:45:55,50
Under his intent gaze, SOMEONE<Salander> clenches her jaw. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS375
00:45:53,00 --> 00:45:57,50
Her guardian holds out his hand. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS376
00:45:55,00 --> 00:46:02,50
Her resigned eyes remain averted as she places her hand in his. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS377
00:45:59,00 --> 00:46:04,50
He strokes the top of it with his thumb, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS378
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:07,50
then pulls her closer and sets her hand against his crotch. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS379
00:46:07,00 --> 00:46:11,50
He makes her rub him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS380
00:46:10,00 --> 00:46:15,50
He stares down at her, his expression hardening. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS381
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:18,50
As he moves her hand against the front of his pants, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS382
00:46:18,00 --> 00:46:23,50
his lips twitch in a sadistic frown. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS383
00:46:21,00 --> 00:46:28,50
SOMEONE<Salander> straightens in her chair her gaze still averted, and lowers his zipper. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS384
00:46:28,00 --> 00:46:33,50
He rolls his exasperated eyes. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS385
00:46:31,00 --> 00:46:38,50
She shoots him a repulsed look then reaches into his pants. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS386
00:46:35,00 --> 00:46:40,50
His lips part in an ecstatic expression. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS387
00:46:39,00 --> 00:46:45,50
Trembling slightly he gently cups a hand to her check. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS388
00:46:47,00 --> 00:46:52,50
She juts out her chin. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS389
00:46:51,00 --> 00:46:56,50
His fingers wrap around the back of her head 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS390
00:46:53,00 --> 00:46:57,50
clutching it. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS391
00:46:54,00 --> 00:47:00,50
And he forces her to bend forward putting her face in his lap. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS392
00:46:58,00 --> 00:47:02,50
Her shoulders and head SOMEONE 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS393
00:47:00,00 --> 00:47:04,50
as she performs fellatio on him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS394
00:47:02,00 --> 00:47:06,50
He closes his eyes. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS395
00:47:07,00 --> 00:47:11,50
He leans his head back. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS396
00:47:12,00 --> 00:47:18,50
Now, in a bathroom, SOMEONE<Salander> rinses her mouth out at a sink. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS397
00:47:16,00 --> 00:47:22,50
Bending over a toilet she shoves a finger down her throat then vomits. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS398
00:47:24,00 --> 00:47:30,50
She wipes her mouth as she exits into her guardian's office. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS399
00:47:27,00 --> 00:47:33,50
He gives her a friendly smile then moves out from behind his desk. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS400
00:47:31,00 --> 00:47:35,50
Holding a check in one hand 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS401
00:47:32,00 --> 00:47:37,50
he picks up her bag and hands it to her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS402
00:47:35,00 --> 00:47:40,50
She slings it over her shoulder then takes the check. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS404
00:47:39,00 --> 00:47:44,50
On her way out the janitor waxing the floor glances at her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS405
00:47:41,00 --> 00:47:46,50
Later seen from behind. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS406
00:47:43,00 --> 00:47:49,50
She sits cross-legged by a space heater on her apartment floor. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS407
00:47:47,00 --> 00:47:53,50
A close drifting bird's eye view passes over her head. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS408
00:47:50,00 --> 00:47:56,50
She smokes a cigarette and listens to ear buds. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS409
00:47:53,00 --> 00:48:00,50
As the view descends, showing her upside down, she stares vacantly. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS410
00:47:58,00 --> 00:48:06,50
Now on a plane, a flight attendant serves SOMEONE<Blomkvist> then continues down the aisle. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS411
00:48:03,00 --> 00:48:09,50
The rugged writer glances out his window at the bright sky, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS412
00:48:06,00 --> 00:48:12,50
then empties two nips of liquor into a plastic cup. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS413
00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:16,50
Later, in London, a cab pulls to a curb and SOMEONE<Blomkvist> climbs out. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS414
00:48:14,00 --> 00:48:22,50
He spritzes his mouth with breath freshener as he strides across the street to a stately stone building. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS416
00:48:20,00 --> 00:48:28,50
he heads down a marble corridor bustling with business people and stops at a reception desk. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS417
00:48:29,00 --> 00:48:35,50
In an office he finds an elegant blonde woman at a desk. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS419
00:49:10,00 --> 00:49:14,50
They’re in a cafe. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS420
00:49:24,00 --> 00:49:28,50
She gives an unnerved look. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS421
00:49:41,00 --> 00:49:45,50
SOMEONE<Anita> gazes off. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS422
00:50:04,00 --> 00:50:08,50
She shrugs her lips. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS423
00:50:27,00 --> 00:50:31,50
She sips from her coffee cup. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS424
00:50:48,00 --> 00:50:52,50
Now with SOMEONE<Salander>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS425
00:50:53,00 --> 00:50:57,50
She walks outside. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS426
00:51:16,00 --> 00:51:25,50
SOMEONE's<Salander’s> pierced lip curls aggressively as she listens. She ends the call and marches down a bustling sidewalk. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS427
00:51:23,00 --> 00:51:31,50
At dusk SOMEONE<Salander> takes a drag off a cigarette as she arrives outside an apartment building. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS428
00:51:28,00 --> 00:51:32,50
She mounts the front stoop 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS429
00:51:30,00 --> 00:51:35,50
She eyes a directory and punches a code into an intercom. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS430
00:51:37,00 --> 00:51:45,50
She enters and climbs a stairwell that wraps an old-fashioned wrought iron elevator shaft. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS432
00:51:43,00 --> 00:51:49,50
On a landing SOMEONE<Bjurman> opens a door and steps into the hall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS433
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:53,50
Clutching the strap of her shoulder bag in her fists 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS434
00:51:51,00 --> 00:51:56,50
she enters a tastefully decorated apartment. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS435
00:51:53,00 --> 00:52:00,50
SOMEONE<Bjurman> shuts the door and positions himself in front of it. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS436
00:52:01,00 --> 00:52:06,50
He smiles. SOMEONE<Salander> lowers her gaze. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS437
00:52:06,00 --> 00:52:12,50
SOMEONE<Bjurman> starts to move past his ward then stops in front of her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS438
00:52:12,00 --> 00:52:17,50
SOMEONE<Salander> avoids his gaze. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS439
00:52:15,00 --> 00:52:20,50
Proceeding past her he leads her down a hallway. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS440
00:52:25,00 --> 00:52:30,50
He ushers her through a doorway. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS441
00:52:27,00 --> 00:52:33,50
It leads to a room with a bed set against the far wall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS442
00:52:30,00 --> 00:52:36,50
SOMEONE<Salander> sets her bag in a chair facing it. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS444
00:52:35,00 --> 00:52:39,50
She removes her jacket. SOMEONE<Bjurman> starts to take it from her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS445
00:52:42,00 --> 00:52:46,50
She goes to the bed. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS446
00:52:49,00 --> 00:52:53,50
SOMEONE<Bjurman> steps closer. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS447
00:52:51,00 --> 00:52:57,50
Perched on the bed's footboard, SOMEONE avoids his gaze. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS448
00:52:54,00 --> 00:52:59,50
SOMEONE<Bjurman> takes her hand. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS449
00:52:56,00 --> 00:53:01,50
He slaps handcuffs on her wrist. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS451
00:52:59,00 --> 00:53:04,50
Looking up, SOMEONE<Salander> bolts for the door. Her hand bumps it shut as SOMEONE<Bjurman> drags her back. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS453
00:53:04,00 --> 00:53:09,50
We drift back down the hall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS454
00:53:06,00 --> 00:53:14,50
In the bedroom a mirror reflects Berman wrestling SOMEONE<Salander> to the floor in a chokehold. Her flailing leg kicks a chair. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS456
00:53:13,00 --> 00:53:20,50
We drift further down the hall, our gaze locked on the door. Fade to black. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS457
00:53:20,00 --> 00:53:28,50
Now, SOMEONE<Salander> wakes face down on the bed with a thick black gag separating her upper and lower teeth. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS458
00:53:26,00 --> 00:53:31,50
Her widely spread arms are chained to the headboard. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS459
00:53:29,00 --> 00:53:36,50
Looking over her shoulder, she finds SOMEONE<Bjurman> chaining her ankles to the footboard. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS460
00:53:33,00 --> 00:53:40,50
SOMEONE<Salander> wrenches against her bonds but they give no sign of budging. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS461
00:53:39,00 --> 00:53:46,50
As SOMEONE<Bjurman> moves up beside her she flails and kicks desperately. The welfare guardian grabs SOMEONE<Salander> by the waistband and yanks her hips up off the mattress. Jamming a pillow under her hips, he drops her upon it. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS462
00:53:43,00 --> 00:53:51,50
SOMEONE<Bjurman> lifts the back of her shirt over her head and lets it fall under her chin. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS465
00:53:56,00 --> 00:54:06,50
Kneeling beside her, he pulls her pants down around her ankles. He twists a fist into the fabric of her black panties and rips them off. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS466
00:54:03,00 --> 00:54:10,50
SOMEONE<Salander> now lies fully exposed from her shoulder blades to her ankles. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS467
00:54:08,00 --> 00:54:13,50
She writhes miserably in her bonds. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS468
00:54:10,00 --> 00:54:19,50
Looking over her shoulder, she finds SOMEONE<Bjurman> unfastening his pants and gives her restraints a desperate tug. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS469
00:54:16,00 --> 00:54:22,50
As her captor drops his pants, she thrashes wrathfully. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS470
00:54:20,00 --> 00:54:27,50
SOMEONE<Bjurman> takes hold of her hips and buries his face between her butt cheeks. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS471
00:54:25,00 --> 00:54:33,50
He positions himself directly over her, sweeps his bathrobe back like a cape and takes out a condom. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS472
00:54:35,00 --> 00:54:39,50
He opens the wrapper. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS473
00:54:38,00 --> 00:54:46,50
SOMEONE<Salander> slams her upper body against the mattress. Looming over her SOMEONE<Bjurman> puts on the condom. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS474
00:54:43,00 --> 00:54:52,50
His gaze hungry and remorseless, SOMEONE<Bjurman> leans down, planting his fists on either side of his victim. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS475
00:54:50,00 --> 00:54:56,50
His bearded jaw works rhythmically as he thrusts himself into her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS476
00:54:54,00 --> 00:54:58,50
SOMEONE<Salander> sobs beneath him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS477
00:54:55,00 --> 00:55:01,50
Her black chin length hair obscuring her face. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS478
00:54:58,00 --> 00:55:06,50
Our gaze drifts to her bag sitting on the chair. A snap gleams on its fabric. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS479
00:55:03,00 --> 00:55:12,50
In Hedestad, as it snows, outdoor lamps gleam along the island bridges crossbeams. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS480
00:55:09,00 --> 00:55:16,50
Outside the guest cottage, the tabby paws at a window then walks out of view. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS481
00:55:13,00 --> 00:55:20,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> stands with his glasses drooped down to his chin. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS482
00:55:17,00 --> 00:55:27,50
He reaches in his pocket and switches off music playing in his earbuds. A few Vanger family keepsakes lie on a table before him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS483
00:55:25,00 --> 00:55:31,50
Four wallet size photos show the young Vanger women. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS484
00:55:28,00 --> 00:55:34,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> reads handwritten notes in SOMEONE's<Harriet’s> white leather Bible. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS485
00:55:44,00 --> 00:55:51,50
SOMEONE flips through the Bible's pages then snaps it closed. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS486
00:55:48,00 --> 00:55:52,50
He lies back on a sofa. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS487
00:55:50,00 --> 00:55:55,50
His head and feet propped up on its armrests. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS488
00:55:52,00 --> 00:55:58,50
The journalist moves his reading glasses to his brow 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS489
00:55:55,00 --> 00:56:00,50
then turns on his music and settles in. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS490
00:55:57,00 --> 00:56:04,50
A slow gliding view behind him drifts toward the top of his head. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS491
00:56:07,00 --> 00:56:15,50
Out view sinks down, moving closer to the side of the sofa until darkness fills our view. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS492
00:56:13,00 --> 00:56:18,50
Now, beside SOMEONE's ravaged bed, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS493
00:56:15,00 --> 00:56:21,50
SOMEONE<Salander> finishes dressing and hobbles painfully to her bag. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS494
00:56:19,00 --> 00:56:25,50
She keeps her head bowed, her hair masking her face from view. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS496
00:56:24,00 --> 00:56:29,50
At a dining table, SOMEONE<Bjurman> glances at her as he writes. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS497
00:56:26,00 --> 00:56:33,50
As his victim shuffles into the hallway with her things, he meets her with a check. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS498
00:56:30,00 --> 00:56:35,50
SOMEONE<Salander> takes it without looking at him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS499
00:56:37,00 --> 00:56:43,50
As she leaves we spot a swollen goose egg at the corner of her mouth. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS500
00:56:41,00 --> 00:56:46,50
He rapist gazes after her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS501
00:56:43,00 --> 00:56:49,50
SOMEONE<Salander> reaches the staircase and SOMEONE<Bjurman> steps back inside. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS503
00:56:47,00 --> 00:56:52,50
bundled up with her hood over her head 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS504
00:56:49,00 --> 00:56:57,50
SOMEONE's<Salander’s> hunched figure shuffles up a brick walkway illuminated with street lamps. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS506
00:56:55,00 --> 00:57:00,50
She lumbers up a flight of outdoor stairs. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS507
00:56:58,00 --> 00:57:03,50
Now, SOMEONE<Salander> arrives at her door. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS508
00:57:01,00 --> 00:57:05,50
Unlocking it she drops her keys. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS509
00:57:03,00 --> 00:57:09,50
She hesitates, then braces a hand against the wall and bends down for them. her bag drops onto the floor and her keys and the check plunk onto a table. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS517
00:57:19,00 --> 00:57:25,50
Later, she takes off her shirt. In the shower, water pours down an exquisite tattoo of a winged dragon that forms a reverse S curve from her left shoulder down along the side of her ribcage. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS518
00:57:23,00 --> 00:57:32,50
As she crouches, water washes away at her feet. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS521
00:57:35,00 --> 00:57:39,50
Now, on the Vanger estate SOMEONE<Blomkvist> smiles at the sight of a parked car. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS523
00:57:40,00 --> 00:57:45,50
The driver's window lowers, revealing his lover's face. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS524
00:57:47,00 --> 00:57:51,50
Now they visit SOMEONE<Henrik> and SOMEONE<Martin>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS526
00:59:09,00 --> 00:59:13,50
In the cottage, SOMEONE pours two drinks. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS527
00:59:34,00 --> 00:59:40,50
She steps through the French doors into the bedroom. The blinds show her silhouette.

SOMEONE<Blomkvist> leaves his drink. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS529

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS531
01:00:02,00 --> 01:00:07,50
SOMEONE<Salander> gives an undaunted shrug. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS532

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS610
01:07:32,00 --> 01:07:37,50
As he obeys, she stands and steps over him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS611
01:07:40,00 --> 01:07:45,50
She throws down a pillow and then dawns a clear face shield. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS612
01:07:44,00 --> 01:07:50,50
Crouching, she turns on an electric tattoo needle. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS613
01:07:47,00 --> 01:07:53,50
SOMEONE<Salander> uncaps a jar of ink then dips the needle in it. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS614
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:56,50
She crouches astride SOMEONE<Bjurman> who struggles beneath her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS615
01:07:53,00 --> 01:07:58,50
SOMEONE<Salander> leans forward, her eyes wide. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS616
01:08:02,00 --> 01:08:11,50
She braces herself against the bed's footboard as she brings the tattoo needle to his chest. Outside the room 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS617
01:08:08,00 --> 01:08:15,50
the floating view withdraws at the littered hall away from the open bedroom door. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS618
01:08:13,00 --> 01:08:20,50
In the cottage, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> initiates a slideshow of the parade photos. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS619
01:08:17,00 --> 01:08:25,50
The images crossfade as they change, creating a disjointed animated effect. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS620
01:08:22,00 --> 01:08:30,50
SOMEONE's<Blomkvist's> brow creases as the images show SOMEONE<Harriet> smiling among her girlfriends. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS621
01:08:27,00 --> 01:08:33,50
She turns, her gaze following something in the parade. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS622
01:08:31,00 --> 01:08:37,50
She lays a hand on a friend's shoulder and backs away from the group. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS623
01:08:35,00 --> 01:08:41,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> leans back in his chair, his gaze chilled. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS624
01:08:40,00 --> 01:08:46,50
The computer replays the ghostly sequence of SOMEONE<Harriet> reacting and her smile becoming a frightened stare. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS626
01:08:46,00 --> 01:08:50,50
Watching the slideshow SOMEONE<Blomkvist> slowly removes his glasses. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS627
01:08:48,00 --> 01:08:53,50
He looks over his shoulder with a troubled gaze as the cat lounges comfortably nearby. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS629
01:08:55,00 --> 01:09:03,50
Back in SOMEONE's<Bjurman's> apartment, SOMEONE<Salander> finishes a drink of water and sets the cup in the bathroom. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS630
01:09:01,00 --> 01:09:08,50
She goes to a chair, gathers up her things and stands over an unconscious SOMEONE<Bjurman>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS631
01:09:06,00 --> 01:09:12,50
Tattooed words cover his torso in a bloody scrawl. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS632
01:09:09,00 --> 01:09:13,50
I am a rapist pig. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS633
01:09:11,00 --> 01:09:17,50
On her way out, SOMEONE<Salander> tosses wire cutters down beside him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS634
01:09:15,00 --> 01:09:20,50
She leaves the apartment without looking back. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS635
01:09:22,00 --> 01:09:28,50
Now SOMEONE<Blomkvist> walks the grounds of the Vanger estate. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS636
01:09:25,00 --> 01:09:30,50
He slows to a stop then smiles. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS637
01:09:29,00 --> 01:09:33,50
SOMEONE<Neila> waits for him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS638
01:09:34,00 --> 01:09:39,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> gives her a big hug and kisses her cheek. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS639
01:09:38,00 --> 01:09:42,50
He picks up her suitcase. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS640
01:09:45,00 --> 01:09:52,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Neila> studies SOMEONE's<Harriet's> list on the wall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS641
01:09:49,00 --> 01:09:55,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> sets two plates on the table and they each take a seat. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS642
01:09:52,00 --> 01:10:00,50
He starts to cut into his sandwich before noticing his daughter's head bowed in prayer. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS643
01:09:57,00 --> 01:10:01,50
Setting down his knife 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS644
01:09:59,00 --> 01:10:03,50
he sits back and wipes his hands. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS645
01:10:01,00 --> 01:10:07,50
His daughter finishes her silent prayer and gives him a look. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS646
01:10:14,00 --> 01:10:21,50
She takes a bite of her sandwich and he pours them each some coffee. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS647
01:10:34,00 --> 01:10:39,50
At the train station. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS648
01:10:41,00 --> 01:10:45,50
They embrace. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS649
01:10:47,00 --> 01:10:52,50
He hands over her bag and she boards her train. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS650
01:10:58,00 --> 01:11:05,50
A door slides shut and she mouths I love you through its window. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS651
01:11:02,00 --> 01:11:08,50
Slack-jawed SOMEONE<Blomkvist> pivots away pensively. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS652
01:11:05,00 --> 01:11:11,50
He glances back at the departing train then heads off. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS653
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:20,50
At the cottage he marches past his desk then stops and grabs the copy of SOMEONE's<Harriet’s> list of names, initials, and numbers from the wall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS654
01:11:19,00 --> 01:11:26,50
He crosses to a windowsill as the cat watches him from a chair. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS655
01:11:23,00 --> 01:11:32,50
Then puts on his reading glasses, picks up SOMEONE's<Harriet’s> Bible and flips to Leviticus Chapters 3-4. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS656
01:11:31,00 --> 01:11:38,50
He thumbs the corner of the page then sits on the couch, puts his feet up 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS657
01:11:35,00 --> 01:11:41,50
and matches the other numbers from the list with Bible verses. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS658
01:11:52,00 --> 01:11:57,50
Now in a phone booth. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS659
01:12:26,00 --> 01:12:30,50
An ambulance races across the bridge. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS660
01:12:31,00 --> 01:12:37,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> exits the phone booth and heads for the bridge. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS661
01:12:34,00 --> 01:12:40,50
Later, the ambulance speeds back followed by cars. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS662
01:12:37,00 --> 01:12:44,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> runs to the tree-lined road and an SUV slows to a stop. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS663
01:12:42,00 --> 01:12:47,50
He speaks to SOMEONE<Martin> through the passenger window. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS664
01:12:53,00 --> 01:12:57,50
SOMEONE<Martin> speeds off. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS665
01:12:54,00 --> 01:13:02,50
Later, in the cottage SOMEONE<Blomkvist> reads Bible verses on his laptop. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS666
01:13:00,00 --> 01:13:05,50
He sets down a drink then answers the door to SOMEONE<Frode>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS667
01:13:05,00 --> 01:13:10,50
The bespectacled man steps inside. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS668
01:13:13,00 --> 01:13:19,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> closes the page of Bible verses on his laptop. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS669
01:13:17,00 --> 01:13:22,50
He sets his glass and a dish in the sink. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS670
01:13:25,00 --> 01:13:32,50
He pours SOMEONE<Frode> a glass of scotch then doffs his glasses and pours one for himself. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS671
01:14:38,00 --> 01:14:42,50
In Stockholm 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS672
01:14:45,00 --> 01:14:49,50
he points to the report. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS673
01:15:02,00 --> 01:15:06,50
He writes on a card. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS674
01:15:28,00 --> 01:15:33,50
The image quickly fades to black. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS675
01:15:31,00 --> 01:15:39,50
Now at a nightclub, SOMEONE<Salander> sits alone sipping a drink as she watches a crowded dance floor. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS676
01:15:37,00 --> 01:15:45,50
The pictures pulses in and out of view, offering us fleeting glimpses of the establishment's trendy young patrons. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS677
01:15:43,00 --> 01:15:48,50
SOMEONE<Salander> ashes her cigarette. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS678
01:15:45,00 --> 01:15:49,50
An exotic beauty approaches. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS679
01:15:47,00 --> 01:15:52,50
She sets her beer on SOMEONE's<Salander's> table. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS680
01:15:49,00 --> 01:15:55,50
The hacker purses her lips then glances aside bashfully. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS681
01:15:53,00 --> 01:15:57,50
The exotic beauty smiles. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS682
01:15:55,00 --> 01:16:01,50
Later, holding a vial she doses SOMEONE<Salander> then kisses her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS683
01:15:59,00 --> 01:16:05,50
The pierced hacker turns the woman's back to a wall, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS684
01:16:02,00 --> 01:16:08,50
feels up her bare thigh to her crotch and kisses her cheek. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS685
01:16:05,00 --> 01:16:12,50
As the exotic young beauty grins in ecstasy, the image fades to black. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS686
01:16:13,00 --> 01:16:20,50
The next morning the two lie in bed together, both of them half-naked. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS687
01:16:17,00 --> 01:16:22,50
SOMEONE<Salander> wakes with a start. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS688
01:16:19,00 --> 01:16:24,50
Her lover stirs as she climbs out of bed. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS690
01:16:22,00 --> 01:16:29,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> carries a takeout bag and two coffees up a stairwell. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS691
01:16:26,00 --> 01:16:32,50
In her bedroom SOMEONE<Salander> puts on an oversized T-shirt. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS692
01:16:29,00 --> 01:16:35,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> approaches the door to her apartment. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS693
01:16:32,00 --> 01:16:36,50
SOMEONE<Salander> heads for her bathroom. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS694
01:16:36,00 --> 01:16:43,50
She pauses eyeing the door, then glances back at her sleeping lover in the bedroom. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS695
01:16:43,00 --> 01:16:49,50
She pivots away from the door, her panicked eyes glancing about. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS696
01:16:51,00 --> 01:17:00,50
She opens the door a crack and peeks out, but SOMEONE<Blomkvist> yanks it wide open. SOMEONE<Salander> recoils as he barges in. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS697
01:17:02,00 --> 01:17:06,50
He eyes the bedroom. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS698
01:17:04,00 --> 01:17:08,50
He enters the kitchen. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS699
01:17:17,00 --> 01:17:24,50
SOMEONE's<Salander's> gaze lingers on him as she returns to her bedroom and pushes the door most of the way shut. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS700
01:17:24,00 --> 01:17:28,50
She wakes her lover. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS701
01:17:30,00 --> 01:17:35,50
The exotic beauty gets out of bed. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS702
01:17:33,00 --> 01:17:40,50
In the kitchen, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> takes off his scarf then sets two plates on the table. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS703
01:17:37,00 --> 01:17:47,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Salander> opens a dresser drawer, takes out her taser and stuffs it in her back pocket. Her lover notices. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS704
01:17:50,00 --> 01:17:54,50
In the kitchen. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS705
01:17:52,00 --> 01:17:59,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> pauses and watches the two young women head to the front door. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS706
01:17:58,00 --> 01:18:06,50
SOMEONE<Salander> opens the door. Her exotic lover steps out, then turns back and gives her a kiss. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS707
01:18:10,00 --> 01:18:14,50
SOMEONE ambles toward the kitchen 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS708
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:17,50
then stops and switches on her taser. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS710
01:18:33,00 --> 01:18:40,50
She grabs a cigarette from an ashtray and a lighter. SOMEONE<Blomkvist> takes a seat. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS711
01:19:19,00 --> 01:19:23,50
He slides a plate toward her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS713
01:19:47,00 --> 01:19:53,50
SOMEONE<Salander> stubs out her cigarette and starts to walk away. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS714
01:19:57,00 --> 01:20:08,50
She points to her head but SOMEONE<Blomkvist> insistently holds out his notes. Taking them, she curtly drops them on the table as she heads out of the room. Now a taxi crosses the bridge back to the island. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS715
01:20:06,00 --> 01:20:12,50
In her apartment, SOMEONE<Salander> enters keywords into her laptop. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS716
01:20:09,00 --> 01:20:17,50
Rape, decapitation, dismemberment, fire, altar, priest, prostitute. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS717
01:20:14,00 --> 01:20:19,50
The taxi parks and SOMEONE<Blomkvist> steps out. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS718
01:20:16,00 --> 01:20:22,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Salander> packs a bag with soda and snacks. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS721
01:20:23,00 --> 01:20:30,50
At her laptop she stuffs junk food in her mouth then types, Magda, underneath a line reading status equals unsolved. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS723
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:34,50
the taxi departs as SOMEONE<Blomkvist> marches back to the cottage. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS724
01:20:31,00 --> 01:20:38,50
Now, SOMEONE<Salander> reads the repeated line, full police report not digitized. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS725
01:20:35,00 --> 01:20:40,50
She shuts her laptop then packs it up. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS726
01:20:37,00 --> 01:20:45,50
At the cottage, SOMEONE picks up the cat's bowl from outside the front door and looks out over the yard. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS727
01:20:44,00 --> 01:20:49,50
Shutting the door behind him,  

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS728
01:20:49,00 --> 01:20:55,50
He enters the kitchen. He sets his leather bag on the floor and the bowl on the counter. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS729
01:20:52,00 --> 01:21:00,50
Grabbing a can from the top of the refrigerator he accidentally knocks over a bottled water. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS730
01:20:57,00 --> 01:21:03,50
It rolls off the side but he catches it and puts it back. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS731
01:21:00,00 --> 01:21:07,50
As he digs through a drawer, our view shifts to find the cat on his desk. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS732
01:21:05,00 --> 01:21:12,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> notices the tabby licking itself and sets down the can. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS733
01:21:10,00 --> 01:21:15,50
He heads over and pets the cat. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS734
01:21:15,00 --> 01:21:26,50
Now, SOMEONE<Salander> rides to a police station. A detective checks her ID card and a letter of recommendation signed Dragan Armanski, CEO Milton Security. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS735
01:21:35,00 --> 01:21:41,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> checks his things as a locksmith changes his lock. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS736
01:22:13,00 --> 01:22:19,50
That night at a hostel SOMEONE<Salander> reads by flashlight. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS737
01:22:29,00 --> 01:22:36,50
In a hospital waiting area, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> meets SOMEONE<Frode> and several members of the SOMEONE<Vanger> family. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS738
01:23:15,00 --> 01:23:21,50
SOMEONE<Isabella> gives her a glower then turns to SOMEONE<Blomkvist>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS739
01:23:25,00 --> 01:23:32,50
Now SOMEONE<Salander> rides her motorcycle over a bridge as a train passes underneath. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS740
01:23:30,00 --> 01:23:34,50

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS801
01:32:14,00 --> 01:32:20,50
As she strides into an adjacent dining room and disappears from view 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS802
01:32:18,00 --> 01:32:23,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> leans forward to stare after her.

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS816
01:33:29,00 --> 01:33:37,50

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS821
01:34:08,00 --> 01:34:12,50
He flinches from her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS822
01:34:10,00 --> 01:34:20,50
She points to his brow then hits a button on the elevator's control panel. SOMEONE<Bjurman> averts his gaze as they resume their descent.

Then stares at the now extensive family tree on the wall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS827
01:34:31,00 --> 01:34:37,50
As he scratches the back of his head, his hand freezes. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS828
01:34:35,00 --> 01:34:43,50
Stepping closer to the postings he examines a photograph in a newspaper article about Gottfried's death. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS829
01:34:41,00 --> 01:34:47,50
The image of the drowning site shows a dock on the Vanger estate. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS831
01:34:45,00 --> 01:34:51,50

He stands by studiously, a rustic cabin at his back. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS833

He consults the newspaper photo then heads over to the cabin. He jiggles a doorknob. He Finds it locked. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS834
01:34:56,00 --> 01:35:01,50
He moves to a window and peers inside. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS836
01:34:59,00 --> 01:35:04,50

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS838
01:35:09,00 --> 01:35:19,50
His foot kicks an empty bottle on the floor as he moves into a neglected room scattered with papers, books, and trash. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS839
01:35:16,00 --> 01:35:22,50
His gaze rose past the paperbacks, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS841
01:35:25,00 --> 01:35:32,50
Moving to a box of books he picks up a children's paperback and flips through it. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS842
01:35:30,00 --> 01:35:36,50
Inside, he finds a name written in a child's shaky cursive.

01:35:36,00 --> 01:35:41,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> climbs a hill away from the cabin. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS846
01:35:39,00 --> 01:35:43,50
Standing at the top, he scans the area contemplatively. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS848
01:35:43,00 --> 01:35:48,50
A bullet hits the utility pole behind him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS849
01:35:47,00 --> 01:35:52,50
He ducks, glances at the pole's chipped wood 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS850
01:35:49,00 --> 01:35:56,50
and notes a bleeding cut just above his right eyebrow. He bolts. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS851
01:35:55,00 --> 01:36:02,50
He races through the woods pushing tree branches aside as he goes. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS852
01:35:59,00 --> 01:36:07,50
Meanwhile, at the cottage, SOMEONE<Salander> removes surveillance cameras from the equipment case.

Its black and white view shows the young woman staring up at it. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS858
01:36:14,00 --> 01:36:19,50
She mounts a camera on an eve of the roof. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS859
01:36:17,00 --> 01:36:23,50
Its view shows a blurry image of her face washed out by light. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS860
01:36:21,00 --> 01:36:26,50
She steps away to reveal the camera's aim at the door. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS861
01:36:24,00 --> 01:36:31,50
Elsewhere on the cottage's exterior she places another hidden camera. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS864
01:36:32,00 --> 01:36:40,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> stumbles as he sprints past SOMEONE's<Henrik's> mansion. I

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS868
01:36:55,00 --> 01:37:01,50
His hand trembles as he wipes his eyes. SOMEONE<Salander> threads a needle. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS869
01:37:02,00 --> 01:37:07,50
She bites a strand off with her teeth and approaches him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS870
01:37:07,00 --> 01:37:12,50
She glances around the bathroom then strides into the kitchen. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS871
01:37:14,00 --> 01:37:19,50
She grabs a vodka bottle from the freezer.

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS876
01:37:41,00 --> 01:37:47,50
Later, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> enters his bedroom still holding the vodka bottle.

01:38:17,00 --> 01:38:21,50
He bows his head. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS883
01:38:20,00 --> 01:38:27,50
In the living room SOMEONE<Salander> takes off her pants. SOMEONE<Blomkvist> touches his cut. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS884
01:38:28,00 --> 01:38:36,50
SOMEONE<Salander> glances around then enters SOMEONE's<Blomkvist's> bedroom in only her panties and tank top. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS885
01:38:43,00 --> 01:38:50,50
Standing in front of him she slides down her panties. His jaw drops. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS886
01:38:58,00 --> 01:39:02,50
She pulls off her shirt. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS887
01:39:01,00 --> 01:39:07,50
Pushing him back onto the bed she straddles him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS888
01:39:04,00 --> 01:39:11,50
They kiss and then she moves her mouth lower and bites his nipple. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS889
01:39:11,00 --> 01:39:18,50
She straightens to a kneeling position and slides his briefs off his waist. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS890
01:39:15,00 --> 01:39:22,50
As he works them down the rest of the way she lowers herself back on top of him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS891
01:39:20,00 --> 01:39:26,50
Rocking her hips, she hovers her mouth mere inches above his. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS892
01:39:24,00 --> 01:39:30,50
He reaches between their legs and pulls her into a kiss. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS893
01:39:27,00 --> 01:39:32,50
She thrusts against him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS894
01:39:29,00 --> 01:39:37,50
He sits up with her straddling his lap and gently flips her, lowering himself on top. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS895
01:39:34,00 --> 01:39:38,50
He kisses her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS896
01:39:35,00 --> 01:39:42,50
Later SOMEONE<Salander> lies on her back still naked, and takes a drag off a cigarette. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS897
01:39:40,00 --> 01:39:47,50
Beside her, propped on his elbows, belly down, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> watches. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS898
01:39:47,00 --> 01:39:53,50
Without looking at him she offers her lit smoke. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS899
01:39:50,00 --> 01:39:56,50
He accepts and she folds her arm behind her head. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS900
01:39:53,00 --> 01:39:58,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> drags off the cigarette. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS901
01:39:55,00 --> 01:40:03,50
Then props his head on his hand. His puzzled eyes fixed on his enigmatic partner. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS903
01:40:01,00 --> 01:40:10,50
Sitting on the counter by the kitchen sink, her hair mussed, SOMEONE<Salander> watches SOMEONE<Blomkvist> emerge from the bedroom. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS904
01:40:07,00 --> 01:40:14,50
He spots two breakfast settings arranged on a small table, then approaches. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS905
01:40:11,00 --> 01:40:16,50
She bites a piece of toast. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS906
01:40:17,00 --> 01:40:23,50
She considers him briefly, then bites her toast again. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS907
01:40:20,00 --> 01:40:26,50
Now they talk with SOMEONE<Martin> and SOMEONE<Frode> in SOMEONE's<Martin's> living room. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS908
01:41:01,00 --> 01:41:06,50
SOMEONE<Frode> and SOMEONE<Martin> move aside to a corner. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS909
01:41:19,00 --> 01:41:23,50
SOMEONE<Martin> walks away. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS910
01:41:33,00 --> 01:41:42,50
Now SOMEONE<Salander> arrives at an industrial complex on her motorcycle and turns through a gate marked with a stately letter V. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS911
01:41:41,00 --> 01:41:48,50
Later, a security guard leads SOMEONE<Salander> into an archive facility. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS912
01:41:45,00 --> 01:41:51,50
Facing a matronly manager through a window 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS913
01:41:48,00 --> 01:41:55,50
the guard gestures at the visitor whose bag and helmet land on a reading table. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS914
01:41:53,00 --> 01:41:58,50
Now a file folder opens on a laptop screen. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS915
01:41:56,00 --> 01:42:02,50
A series of photos shows the parade then the Hedestad bridge. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS916
01:42:00,00 --> 01:42:07,50
Scrolling through the images in his cottage, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> comes to snapshots of the accident. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS917
01:42:04,00 --> 01:42:11,50
In a couple of them he notices the blurred figure of a man holding a camera. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS918
01:42:09,00 --> 01:42:16,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> hurries to his posted photo of Harold Vanger on the family tree. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS919
01:42:13,00 --> 01:42:19,50
Our view drops to SOMEONE's<Cecilia's> information right below it. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS920
01:42:16,00 --> 01:42:22,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> prints out some photos and leaves with them. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS922
01:42:22,00 --> 01:42:27,50
As SOMEONE studies documents at the archive, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS923
01:42:46,00 --> 01:42:53,50
Her partner visits SOMEONE. She slides the printed photos across a table to SOMEONE<Blomkvist>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS924
01:42:50,00 --> 01:42:55,50
Picking them up, he gives an imploring stare. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS925
01:42:53,00 --> 01:42:58,50
Back at the Vanger Industries archives. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS926
01:43:14,00 --> 01:43:20,50
With a prim glare, the corporate archives manager makes a phone call. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS927
01:43:18,00 --> 01:43:23,50
Later, she coldly escorts SOMEONE<Salander> into an elevator. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS928
01:43:21,00 --> 01:43:27,50
As its gate lowers the manager puts on white cotton gloves. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS929
01:43:24,00 --> 01:43:31,50
Now on a ladder she takes two heavy volumes from a high shelf. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS930
01:43:28,00 --> 01:43:34,50
She looks to SOMEONE<Salander> who makes no move to assist her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS931
01:43:31,00 --> 01:43:38,50
The archives manager climbs down and adds the books to a fully stacked cart. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS932
01:43:35,00 --> 01:43:41,50
As she wheels it out of view SOMEONE<Salander> follows. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS933
01:43:38,00 --> 01:43:43,50
Now in a dimly lit foyer SOMEONE<Blomkvist> turns. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS935
01:43:42,00 --> 01:43:50,50
From an upper landing a hunched old man smokes a cigar as he rides a motorized chair down a staircase. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS936
01:43:47,00 --> 01:43:53,50
SOMEONE's<Blomkvist’s> brow furrows and he swallows nervously. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS937
01:43:53,00 --> 01:43:57,50
Harold climbs out of the chair. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS938
01:43:56,00 --> 01:44:01,50
He leads SOMEONE<Blomkvist> into a den. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS939
01:44:00,00 --> 01:44:06,50
Three rifles hang on a rack by the door. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS940
01:44:03,00 --> 01:44:09,50
As the old man settles into a chair among stacks of books 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS941
01:44:06,00 --> 01:44:12,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> studies photos of Nazis on a wall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS942
01:44:29,00 --> 01:44:33,50
He gestures to a drawer. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS943
01:44:30,00 --> 01:44:37,50
Back at the archives SOMEONE<Salander> spreads out a map of Sweden. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS944
01:44:34,00 --> 01:44:40,50
Circular V emblems SOMEONE<mark> Vanger Holdings all over the country. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS945
01:44:38,00 --> 01:44:44,50
SOMEONE<Salander> shifts her gaze then goes to another table. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS946
01:44:41,00 --> 01:44:48,50
She comes back with the list of the murders, which gives their dates and locations. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS947
01:44:45,00 --> 01:44:52,50
For each location she finds a corresponding Vanger property on the map. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS948
01:44:49,00 --> 01:44:56,50
Now, Harold pours tea as SOMEONE<Blomkvist> looks through his personal photos. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS949
01:45:02,00 --> 01:45:07,50
He offers a cigarette. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS950
01:45:09,00 --> 01:45:14,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> lights it and takes a drag. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS951
01:45:26,00 --> 01:45:32,50
The journalist looks up at Harold's earnest scowl. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS952
01:45:30,00 --> 01:45:36,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> sets down a stack of photos and moves on to some others. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS953
01:45:33,00 --> 01:45:38,50
One features a search party in the woods. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS954
01:45:57,00 --> 01:46:02,50
The blurry teen wears a prep school blazer. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS956
01:46:00,00 --> 01:46:07,50
At the archives, photos of the murder victims now lie on their corresponding locations. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS957
01:46:04,00 --> 01:46:09,50
The manager finds SOMEONE<Salander> at a card catalog. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS958
01:46:19,00 --> 01:46:25,50
The matronly woman stays put staring at her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS959
01:46:24,00 --> 01:46:30,50
As the manager steps away the visitor selects a catalog card. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS960
01:46:28,00 --> 01:46:33,50
Later SOMEONE<Salander> flips through a book. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS961
01:46:30,00 --> 01:46:37,50
The manager locks up her office then tosses keys on a nearby table. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS962
01:46:37,00 --> 01:46:46,50
As the manager marches out haughtily SOMEONE<Salander> finishes flipping through the pages of a binder then shuts it. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS963
01:46:46,00 --> 01:46:52,50
She opens another labeled 1957. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS964
01:46:49,00 --> 01:46:55,50
Each page boasts a single news clipping pasted at its center. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS965
01:46:53,00 --> 01:46:59,50
SOMEONE<Salander> pauses at an article with a photo headlined Carlin and Vanger rebuilt local port. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS967
01:46:59,00 --> 01:47:06,50
She brings the binder to her laptop and calls up a casefile on one of the murders. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS971
01:47:10,00 --> 01:47:18,50
SOMEONE<Salander> looks down at a photo in the newspaper article captioned Gottfried Vanger and Carlin Shaking Hands. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS972
01:47:16,00 --> 01:47:23,50
She brings up a digital copy of the photo of Gottfried from SOMEONE's<Blomkvist’s> wall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS973
01:47:20,00 --> 01:47:26,50
Then opens a spreadsheet charting the serial murder details. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS974
01:47:24,00 --> 01:47:28,50
Searching another binder 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS975
01:47:25,00 --> 01:47:30,50
she stops at an article featuring Gottfried. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS976
01:47:27,00 --> 01:47:34,50
A typed heading above reads, Palmar, 28th of October 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS978
01:47:33,00 --> 01:47:41,50
On the spreadsheet a row detailing SOMEONE<Marie> Homburg's Palmar murder ends with a blank field. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS981
01:47:42,00 --> 01:47:48,50
SOMEONE<Salander> flips through another binder stopping at the typed heading. A newspaper photo shows Gottfried at a podium.

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS986
01:47:57,00 --> 01:48:04,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> returns to the cottage and brings up the honeymooner's parade photos. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS987
01:48:02,00 --> 01:48:08,50
One shows a partially obscured figure wearing a prep school blazer. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS988
01:48:05,00 --> 01:48:11,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> notes the time on a clock positioned above him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS989
01:48:09,00 --> 01:48:18,50
At the archives SOMEONE finds a newspaper featuring a Vanger Industries investment and SOMEONE's murder on the same page. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS990
01:48:16,00 --> 01:48:21,50
As she reads, a figure passes in the next room. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS991
01:48:20,00 --> 01:48:27,50
She turns, finding herself alone among the cold metallic book stacks. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS993
01:48:25,00 --> 01:48:33,50
Now on the spreadsheet, Gottfried's name types out with a question SOMEONE in the row detailing SOMEONE's murder. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS995
01:48:31,00 --> 01:48:39,50
In the cottage SOMEONE<Blomkvist> takes the photo of SOMEONE<Martin> with the search party to a table bearing stacks of case files.

01:48:39,00 --> 01:48:46,50
Selecting the file for Lena Anderson, he flips through its pages and finds a portrait of the girl in a shirt bearing her school crest. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS998
01:48:44,00 --> 01:48:49,50
He holds it up with the search party photo comparing it with the identical crest on SOMEONE's<Martin's> blazer. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1001
01:48:52,00 --> 01:48:59,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> looks up, shifting his jaw.  

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1002
01:48:56,00 --> 01:49:04,50
At the archives, SOMEONE flips through a binder and finds an obituary reading. In memoriam, Gottfried Vanger 1927-1965. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1003
01:49:01,00 --> 01:49:09,50
Now SOMEONE<Blomkvist> leaves the cottage holding up his cell phone for a signal as he dials a call. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1004
01:49:11,00 --> 01:49:16,50
He glares at his phone then looks up. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1005
01:49:13,00 --> 01:49:19,50
SOMEONE's<Martin's> house glows from its steep hilltop perch. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1006
01:49:16,00 --> 01:49:21,50
Staring grimly at it SOMEONE<Blomkvist> backtracks towards the cottage. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1009
01:49:24,00 --> 01:49:29,50
At the archives SOMEONE<Salander> takes Gottfried's obituary to her laptop. She marks the date of death. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1010
01:49:26,00 --> 01:49:31,50
Then notices a murder listed as two years later 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1012
01:49:31,00 --> 01:49:37,50
In its blank suspect field she types a row of question marks. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1013
01:49:34,00 --> 01:49:40,50
She wearily rolls her neck then leaves with the keys. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1014
01:49:40,00 --> 01:49:46,50
Our view closes in on her open laptop. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1015
01:49:43,00 --> 01:49:50,50
On the spreadsheet the cursor blinks at the end of the long row of question marks. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1017
01:49:49,00 --> 01:49:55,50
In the cottage SOMEONE<Blomkvist> removes his reading glasses and shifts his thoughtful gaze. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1018
01:49:52,00 --> 01:50:00,50
He marches back out leaving the photos of SOMEONE<Martin> and Lena on his laptop keyboard. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1019
01:49:57,00 --> 01:50:06,50
At Vanger Industries SOMEONE<Salander> gets on the elevator, stretches her neck and shoulders and zips up her hoodie. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1020
01:50:03,00 --> 01:50:08,50
The gate lowers beside her. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1021
01:50:05,00 --> 01:50:12,50
Now SOMEONE<Blomkvist> climbs a steeply ascending walkway overlooking the water. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1022
01:50:10,00 --> 01:50:15,50
He stops facing SOMEONE's<Martin's> now dimly lit home. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1023
01:50:13,00 --> 01:50:21,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Salander> trails her fingertips along the volumes of archives as she walks through the stacks. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1024
01:50:19,00 --> 01:50:24,50
Coming to an intersection, she turns out of view. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1025
01:50:22,00 --> 01:50:30,50
Now SOMEONE<Blomkvist> moves around the perimeter of SOMEONE's<Martin's> house. Peering inside through the floor to ceiling windows. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1026
01:50:28,00 --> 01:50:34,50
He makes his way to a bedroom door, tries the handle, and finds it locked. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1027
01:50:32,00 --> 01:50:38,50
Continuing around the house he comes to the kitchen and living room. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1028
01:50:38,00 --> 01:50:42,50
He tries another door and it slides open. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1030
01:50:42,00 --> 01:50:46,50
He leans in cautiously. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1031
01:50:50,00 --> 01:50:57,50
Elsewhere a Range Rover turns into view. It crosses the bridge into Hedestad. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1032
01:50:54,00 --> 01:51:03,50
Meanwhile SOMEONE<Blomkvist> slips inside the house. As he creeps past an island counter he pauses at a set of knives. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1033
01:51:00,00 --> 01:51:07,50
He takes one from the knife block revealing its long smooth edged blade. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1034
01:51:07,00 --> 01:51:12,50
Now, SOMEONE's<Martin's> SUV reaches the island. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1035
01:51:10,00 --> 01:51:16,50
Back at his house SOMEONE<Blomkvist> ventures down a brief corridor. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1036
01:51:13,00 --> 01:51:18,50
He tries the door at the far end but it doesn't budge. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1037
01:51:16,00 --> 01:51:22,50
We watch from outside as he goes to the bedroom and peeks through a partially opened door. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1038
01:51:20,00 --> 01:51:27,50
At the archives SOMEONE<Salander> pushes through heavy doors and approaches some vending machines. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1039
01:51:25,00 --> 01:51:30,50
A security guard sits in a windowed booth beside them. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1040
01:51:28,00 --> 01:51:33,50
As he watches SOMEONE through the glass 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1041
01:51:30,00 --> 01:51:35,50
she instinctively jerks her hood up over her head 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1042
01:51:32,00 --> 01:51:37,50
then punches in her selections. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1044
01:51:35,00 --> 01:51:42,50
the Range Rover pulls up behind SOMEONE's<Henrik's> mansion and cuts its headlights. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1045
01:51:39,00 --> 01:51:44,50
SOMEONE<Martin> gets out and gazes toward the cottage. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1046
01:51:42,00 --> 01:51:48,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> continues to explore his sleek modern home. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1047
01:51:46,00 --> 01:51:51,50
At the Vanger Industries vending machines 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1048
01:51:48,00 --> 01:51:55,50
SOMEONE<Salander> takes a sandwich from a compartment and collects a paper cup of coffee. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1049
01:51:52,00 --> 01:51:58,50
As she leaves the room, the guard makes a note on a clipboard. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1050
01:51:55,00 --> 01:52:03,50
From outside SOMEONE's<Martin's> home we watch SOMEONE<Blomkvist> striding more boldly through the living room. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1051
01:52:00,00 --> 01:52:07,50
Reaching the dining area he pauses to face a dark corridor beside him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1052
01:52:04,00 --> 01:52:09,50
He ventures down it wearily. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1053
01:52:06,00 --> 01:52:13,50
It turns at a right angle leading him to a study with a gun case on the wall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1054
01:52:11,00 --> 01:52:17,50
He cautiously approaches the room, opens its glass door and enters. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1055
01:52:15,00 --> 01:52:19,50
Stepping into the center of the study 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1056
01:52:16,00 --> 01:52:22,50
he peers through another door into the darkness outside. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1058
01:52:21,00 --> 01:52:25,50
he notices the gun case. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1059
01:52:22,00 --> 01:52:29,50
Its glass door shows a rack built for four rifles. It contains only three. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1061
01:52:31,00 --> 01:52:40,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> turns on the spot. His lips pressed together tightly. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1062
01:52:37,00 --> 01:52:44,50
Later, arriving in another room he pauses and stares past a glass cabinet displaying an impressive wine collection. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1063
01:52:42,00 --> 01:52:49,50
Stepping forward he tries a door at the other end of the room and finds it locked. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1064
01:52:46,00 --> 01:52:52,50
At the archives SOMEONE<Salander> munches on her sandwich as she walks among the towering stacks. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1065
01:52:50,00 --> 01:52:54,50
She sips her coffee then wipes her mouth with her hand. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1067
01:52:54,00 --> 01:53:01,50
Back in Hedestad, SOMEONE stands and faces him with a nonchalant wave. SOMEONE's<Martin's> SUV travels down a curving path. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1068
01:52:58,00 --> 01:53:04,50
Back in Hedestad, SOMEONE's SUV travels down a curving path. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1069
01:53:01,00 --> 01:53:07,50
As SOMEONE<Blomkvist> explores his house light sweeps across a nearby wall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1070
01:53:05,00 --> 01:53:08,50
Turning, he spots the SUV arriving outside. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1072
01:53:09,00 --> 01:53:16,50
He scrambles to a recess and puts his back to a pair of doors. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1073
01:53:14,00 --> 01:53:21,50
SOMEONE<Martin> gets out of his SUV and opens one of its back doors. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1074
01:53:18,00 --> 01:53:22,50
In the house, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> lunges sideways and pulls a door closed. Outside, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1076
01:53:21,00 --> 01:53:29,50
SOMEONE<Martin> heads for the house with a vertical four-foot long bag slung over his shoulder. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1077
01:53:26,00 --> 01:53:33,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> darts out of the corridor. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1078
01:53:30,00 --> 01:53:36,50
Reaching the dining area he finds himself fully exposed by its floor to ceiling windows. He looks over his shoulder then darts out of view as SOMEONE<Martin> enters the house. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1079
01:53:33,00 --> 01:53:39,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> dashes from the living room just before the owner comes in. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1080
01:53:36,00 --> 01:53:40,50
SOMEONE<Martin> pauses, shifting his weary gaze. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1082
01:53:40,00 --> 01:53:45,50
From outside, we watch SOMEONE backing across the bedroom. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1083
01:53:43,00 --> 01:53:49,50
Reaching a door in the corner he turns the handle. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1084
01:53:47,00 --> 01:53:52,50
In the living room SOMEONE<Martin> sets his bag down and approaches the kitchen. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1085
01:53:50,00 --> 01:53:56,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> opens the bedroom door and slips out. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1086
01:53:54,00 --> 01:54:00,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Martin> finds the backdoor from the kitchen slightly ajar. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1087
01:53:57,00 --> 01:54:03,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> peeks in through a window then makes a run for it. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1088
01:54:00,00 --> 01:54:06,50
SOMEONE<Martin> slides the kitchen door open, gazing out. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1089
01:54:05,00 --> 01:54:09,50
Running toward the steps, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> loses his footing and falls. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1090
01:54:08,00 --> 01:54:14,50
SOMEONE<Martin> turns and spots him. SOMEONE<Blomkvist> stands and faces him with a nonchalant wave. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1091
01:54:34,00 --> 01:54:40,50
Smiling calmly, SOMEONE<Martin> heads into the house. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1092
01:54:37,00 --> 01:54:45,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> stares after him with a furrowed brow then reluctantly follows with a slight limp. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1093
01:54:43,00 --> 01:54:51,50
At the archives, photos of the murder victims sprawl across various locations on the Swedish map. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1094
01:54:48,00 --> 01:54:55,50
Sitting by her laptop SOMEONE flips through magazine-like company newsletters. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1095
01:54:52,00 --> 01:54:56,50
She pauses at a photo of a dinner. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1098
01:55:02,00 --> 01:55:06,50
SOMEONE locates the teen boy wearing his school blazer. She rubs the crest with her finger. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1101
01:55:08,00 --> 01:55:13,50
Sweeping her sandwich wrapper off the keyboard she brings up the parade photos. She finds the one with SOMEONE, recognizable by his blazer. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1106
01:55:28,00 --> 01:55:36,50
In the house. Coming inside, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> complies. SOMEONE<Martin> takes off his jacket and drapes it over a low cabinet. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1107
01:55:45,00 --> 01:55:53,50
SOMEONE<Martin> crosses to the island counter. He takes a small flashlight from a drawer and tosses it to SOMEONE<Blomkvist>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1108
01:56:02,00 --> 01:56:08,50
Pouring two drinks SOMEONE<Martin> notices the empty slot in his knife block. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1109
01:56:11,00 --> 01:56:16,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> pockets the flashlight. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1110
01:56:13,00 --> 01:56:20,50
SOMEONE<Martin> adds a little tap water to the drinks then gives one to his guest. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1111
01:56:28,00 --> 01:56:35,50
SOMEONE's<Blomkvist’s> gaze falls on a rifle bag standing propped up near SOMEONE's<Martin's> jacket. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1112
01:56:33,00 --> 01:56:38,50
His host notices then gives a shrewd smile. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1113
01:56:40,00 --> 01:56:46,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> avoids his gaze. SOMEONE<Martin> sips his drink. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1114
01:57:00,00 --> 01:57:07,50
Setting his glass down, SOMEONE<Martin> circles back around the island. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1115
01:57:08,00 --> 01:57:13,50
He takes a gun from a drawer. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1116
01:57:13,00 --> 01:57:18,50
He cocks it and gestures at his knife block. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1117
01:57:18,00 --> 01:57:23,50
He steps out from behind the island. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1118
01:57:22,00 --> 01:57:28,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> shifts his defeated gaze. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1119
01:57:25,00 --> 01:57:32,50
Under SOMEONE's<Martin's> cold stare he takes the knife from his coat and drops it on the counter. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1120
01:57:30,00 --> 01:57:33,50
Meanwhile, hurrying from the archives SOMEONE<Salander> drops off the keys at the empty security booth. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1122
01:57:36,00 --> 01:57:43,50
Now, SOMEONE<Martin> ushers SOMEONE<Blomkvist> through his house at gunpoint. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1123
01:57:40,00 --> 01:57:47,50
Outside Vanger Industries SOMEONE<Salander> walks briskly with her phone to her ear. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1124
01:57:49,00 --> 01:57:53,50
At the house. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1125
01:57:51,00 --> 01:57:55,50
They stop at the wine case. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1126
01:58:00,00 --> 01:58:08,50
SOMEONE<Martin> touches a keycard to a panel and the door behind SOMEONE<Blomkvist> opens. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1127
01:58:05,00 --> 01:58:12,50
Outside Vanger Industries SOMEONE<Salander> races off on her motorcycle. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1128
01:58:10,00 --> 01:58:18,50
In the house SOMEONE<Martin> keeps his gun trained on SOMEONE<Blomkvist> as he ushers him down a dark narrow stairway. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1129
01:58:15,00 --> 01:58:19,50
His drink in hand, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1130
01:58:17,00 --> 01:58:23,50
the journalist takes in his surroundings as they pass through an electrical room. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1131
01:58:21,00 --> 01:58:27,50
Behind him SOMEONE<Martin> glowers darkly at his captive. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1132
01:58:24,00 --> 01:58:32,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> reaches a steel door and halts. He faces SOMEONE<Martin> who scans his key card on a panel. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1133
01:58:30,00 --> 01:58:35,50
The door swings open into a dark space. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1134
01:58:35,00 --> 01:58:43,50
The journalist steps through. SOMEONE<Martin> follows and turns on a light revealing a torture chamber with a white tiled center. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1135
01:58:41,00 --> 01:58:49,50
Turning, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> finds him covering his own face with an oxygen mask as he flips a switch. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1136
01:58:46,00 --> 01:58:54,50
Gas plumes from ceiling pipes. SOMEONE<Blomkvist> collapses, his drink shattering beside him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1137
01:58:54,00 --> 01:58:59,50
The fumes fill our view. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1138
01:58:56,00 --> 01:59:08,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Salander> speeds across the bridge. Now, SOMEONE<Martin> uses a cable and harness with armpit straps and a neck brace to hoist up his captive in the white tiled area. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1139
01:59:06,00 --> 01:59:11,50
A video camera stands on a tripod facing SOMEONE<Blomkvist>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1140
01:59:09,00 --> 01:59:17,50
Handcuffs and chains prevent him from lifting his hands any higher than his abdomen. SOMEONE<Martin> brings a fresh drink. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1141
01:59:16,00 --> 01:59:20,50
He holds it out insistently. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1142
01:59:17,00 --> 01:59:24,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> grasps it in his tightly restrained hand and stares down at it. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1143
01:59:21,00 --> 01:59:29,50
SOMEONE<Martin> steps away setting his gun on a monitor displaying a feed from the video camera. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1144
01:59:32,00 --> 01:59:39,50
SOMEONE<Martin> makes adjustments to the video camera. SOMEONE<Blomkvist> surveys his surroundings. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1145
01:59:42,00 --> 01:59:48,50
SOMEONE<Martin> sits on a sofa. SOMEONE<Blomkvist> arches his back then slumps. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1146
02:01:08,00 --> 02:01:15,50
At the cottage SOMEONE<Salander> drops her helmet and bag then looks around for SOMEONE<Blomkvist>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1147
02:01:12,00 --> 02:01:20,50
She crosses to his laptop and finds the photograph of young SOMEONE among the search party, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1148
02:01:17,00 --> 02:01:22,50
wearing his prep school blazer. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1149
02:01:19,00 --> 02:01:24,50
She switches on the laptop 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1150
02:01:21,00 --> 02:01:26,50
which shows the photo of young SOMEONE<Martin> at the parade. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1151
02:01:24,00 --> 02:01:29,50
She looks up from the laptop then crosses the room, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1152
02:01:26,00 --> 02:01:32,50
picks up a duffle bag and takes out the portable monitor. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1153
02:01:31,00 --> 02:01:36,50
Meanwhile, in the torture chamber. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1154
02:01:42,00 --> 02:01:49,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> stares at him. SOMEONE<Martin> glances back at the camera. A monitor shows the prisoner. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1155
02:02:01,00 --> 02:02:05,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> eyes him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1156
02:02:17,00 --> 02:02:22,50
SOMEONE<Martin> gets up scratching his hand. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1157
02:02:25,00 --> 02:02:29,50
He uses hand sanitizer. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1158
02:02:28,00 --> 02:02:32,50
He returns to his seat. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1159
02:03:38,00 --> 02:03:42,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> sneers. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1160
02:03:49,00 --> 02:03:55,50
In the cottage SOMEONE<Salander> studies surveillance feeds on the portable monitor. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1161
02:03:53,00 --> 02:03:58,50
She holds its screen up close viewing SOMEONE<Martin> at the front door. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1162
02:03:56,00 --> 02:04:03,50
Two of the three angles show the SOMEONE<villain> entering the cottage through a wooden side door. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1163
02:04:00,00 --> 02:04:05,50
SOMEONE<Salander> puts the monitor down and heads off. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1164
02:04:03,00 --> 02:04:09,50
In the basement, SOMEONE<Martin> switches on a reel-to-reel tape player. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1165
02:04:06,00 --> 02:04:11,50
His helpless prisoner grimaces in pain. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1166
02:04:44,00 --> 02:04:49,50
He clutches the neck brace, lifting SOMEONE<Blomkvist>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1167
02:04:53,00 --> 02:04:57,50
SOMEONE<Martin> lets him go. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1168
02:05:00,00 --> 02:05:07,50
While SOMEONE<Blomkvist> catches his breath SOMEONE<Martin> ties a plastic bag over his head. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1169
02:05:09,00 --> 02:05:16,50
SOMEONE<Martin> flips a switch and a cable lifts SOMEONE<Blomkvist> a few feet off the floor. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1170
02:05:14,00 --> 02:05:19,50
As his captor casually taps his fingers on a counter, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1171
02:05:17,00 --> 02:05:23,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> glances at him through the bag. His mouth open wide. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1172
02:05:20,00 --> 02:05:25,50
SOMEONE<Martin> returns with a utility knife. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1173
02:05:23,00 --> 02:05:30,50
The clear plastic sticks to SOMEONE's<Blomkvist’s> face as he inhales, and puffs out as he exhales. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1174
02:05:28,00 --> 02:05:34,50
SOMEONE<Martin> studies his prisoner, cracking a subtle smile. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1175
02:05:32,00 --> 02:05:37,50
He rips open SOMEONE's button over shirt 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1176
02:05:34,00 --> 02:05:43,50
then uses the utility knife to tear open his undershirt, exposing the helpless man's chest. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1177
02:05:40,00 --> 02:05:48,50
SOMEONE<Martin> unbuttons SOMEONE's<Blomkvist’s> pants then stands upright and steps back, gazing thoughtfully. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1178
02:05:49,00 --> 02:05:57,50
SOMEONE's<Blomkvist’s> eyes bulge. SOMEONE<Martin> meets his terrified gaze then ambles back to the counter. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1179
02:06:05,00 --> 02:06:10,50
He returns with a kitchen knife. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1180
02:06:07,00 --> 02:06:15,50
As his prisoner continues to gasp for air, he presses on his midsection with his fingertips. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1181
02:06:13,00 --> 02:06:19,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Salander> enters the basement wielding a golf club. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1182
02:06:17,00 --> 02:06:21,50
She approaches SOMEONE<Martin> from behind. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1183
02:06:21,00 --> 02:06:27,50
He turns and she strikes him in the face knocking him to the tile floor. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1184
02:06:25,00 --> 02:06:32,50
She lowers SOMEONE<Blomkvist> then rips the plastic bag off his face and unshackles his ankles. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1185
02:06:30,00 --> 02:06:36,50
His jaw misaligned, SOMEONE<Martin> struggles to his feet and runs out. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1186
02:06:34,00 --> 02:06:38,50
SOMEONE<Salander> sees him go. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1187
02:06:40,00 --> 02:06:46,50
SOMEONE<Martin> runs through a corridor. SOMEONE<Salander> grabs the gun. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1188
02:06:43,00 --> 02:06:48,50
SOMEONE<Martin> runs upstairs. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1189
02:06:45,00 --> 02:06:50,50
SOMEONE<Salander> crouches over SOMEONE<Blomkvist>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1190
02:06:50,00 --> 02:06:57,50
Leaving him behind, she runs out the door through the corridor and up the darkened steps. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1191
02:06:54,00 --> 02:07:01,50
With her gun at the ready, SOMEONE<Salander> crosses the kitchen in search of the SOMEONE<villain>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1192
02:06:58,00 --> 02:07:05,50
She looks in a study then heads through a hallway past a modern painting 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1193
02:07:02,00 --> 02:07:07,50
and approaches the dining table. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1194
02:07:04,00 --> 02:07:10,50
She turns a corner, peers down another hallway, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1195
02:07:07,00 --> 02:07:11,50
then scans the living room. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1196
02:07:13,00 --> 02:07:21,50
Outside, SOMEONE's<Martin's> Range Rover backs out. SOMEONE<Salander> breaks into a run. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1197
02:07:18,00 --> 02:07:23,50
The SUV climbs the gravel driveway. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1198
02:07:20,00 --> 02:07:30,50
Stepping outside SOMEONE<Salander> spots its headlights over a ridge. She tucks the gun behind her back and climbs on her bike. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1199
02:07:27,00 --> 02:07:32,50
The SUV cruises a forest road. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1200
02:07:29,00 --> 02:07:35,50
Pulling out, the motorcycle kicks up gravel. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1201
02:07:32,00 --> 02:07:38,50
As SOMEONE<Martin> struggles to drive, the SUV swerves. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1202
02:07:35,00 --> 02:07:43,50
SOMEONE<Salander> catches air then races down the forest road and rounds a bend. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1203
02:07:40,00 --> 02:07:45,50
Her lone headlight shines through SOMEONE's<Martin's> back window. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1204
02:07:43,00 --> 02:07:48,50
Her view finds the SUV rounding a bend. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1205
02:07:45,00 --> 02:07:56,50
SOMEONE<Martin> checks his rearview mirror. SOMEONE<Salander> hunches over her bikes handle bars. The vehicles race along the forest road flanked by tall thin trees. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1206
02:07:53,00 --> 02:08:01,50
Now the motorcycle gains on the SUV jouncing in the cold rushing air. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1207
02:07:58,00 --> 02:08:06,50
SOMEONE<Martin> checks his rearview again. She follows him down a hill peering ahead with a determined gaze. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1208
02:08:04,00 --> 02:08:09,50
As they reach the bridge SOMEONE<Salander> rides up close. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1209
02:08:06,00 --> 02:08:13,50
SOMEONE<Martin> spots her in his side mirror then cuts her off before she can pass. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1210
02:08:11,00 --> 02:08:16,50
She tries the other side but he blocks her way. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1211
02:08:13,00 --> 02:08:23,50
Nearing the end of the bridge she fakes him out and as his SUV grazes the right hand railing, SOMEONE<Salander> races ahead on his left. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1212
02:08:20,00 --> 02:08:25,50
She veers across his path. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1213
02:08:22,00 --> 02:08:29,50
He swerves through a wooden fence, banks off a low stonewall and goes airborne. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1214
02:08:26,00 --> 02:08:36,50
As SOMEONE<Salander> skids off her bike, SOMEONE's<Martin's> SUV grinds on its side into a fuel tank outside the grocery store. SOMEONE<Salander> approaches. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1215
02:08:34,00 --> 02:08:38,50
Thick smoke rises from the wreck. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1216
02:08:36,00 --> 02:08:43,50
Approaching the vehicle SOMEONE<Salander> removes the gun from her waistband and holds it at her side. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1217
02:08:40,00 --> 02:08:47,50
Inside the SUV SOMEONE<Martin> watches through the windshield. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1218
02:08:44,00 --> 02:08:52,50
Still about 50 yards away, SOMEONE<Salander> continues her march towards the wreck through a gentle snowfall. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1219
02:08:49,00 --> 02:08:54,50
SOMEONE<Martin> watches her. His face bloody. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1220
02:08:52,00 --> 02:08:57,50
The pale woman's gaze remains fixed on him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1221
02:08:54,00 --> 02:08:58,50
He sees a spark. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1222
02:08:56,00 --> 02:09:03,50
A fiery explosion erupts, rising over 50 feet high. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1223
02:09:00,00 --> 02:09:06,50
SOMEONE<Salander> steps back and watches the SUV burn. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1224
02:09:04,00 --> 02:09:09,50
The flames reach into the night sky. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1225
02:09:06,00 --> 02:09:14,50
Our view swings around behind the young woman. The burning wreck now visible over her shoulder. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1226
02:09:11,00 --> 02:09:17,50
She looks at the gun, releases its trigger, then turns away. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1227
02:09:15,00 --> 02:09:20,50
She marches back to her motorcycle. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1231
02:09:26,00 --> 02:09:34,50
A hearse drives off, leaving behind the charred SUV, which still lies on its side. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1232
02:09:31,00 --> 02:09:36,50
A flatbed tow truck pulls around the wreck. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1233
02:09:34,00 --> 02:09:40,50
A hovering view from the middle of the bridge draws back from the scene. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1234
02:09:38,00 --> 02:09:44,50
The image dissolves to SOMEONE<Blomkvist> who lies on his back in bed. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1235
02:09:42,00 --> 02:09:47,50
He rolls on his side and faces SOMEONE<Salander>.

02:09:44,00 --> 02:09:50,50
She gazes at him, lying on her side. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1237
02:09:49,00 --> 02:09:58,50
The petite young woman wears a black tank top. The head of her dragon tattoo visible on her bare shoulder. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1238
02:10:23,00 --> 02:10:27,50
She lowers her gaze. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1239
02:10:31,00 --> 02:10:36,50
She looks at him directly. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1240
02:10:48,00 --> 02:10:52,50
She leaves him lying on the bed. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1241
02:10:50,00 --> 02:10:58,50
In the kitchen she sets down a coffee mug then produces two photos of a nude teenage girl. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1242
02:11:21,00 --> 02:11:26,50
SOMEONE<Salander> glances aside. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1243
02:11:28,00 --> 02:11:33,50
She follows him into the living room. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1244
02:11:38,00 --> 02:11:45,50
SOMEONE<Salander> stands behind SOMEONE<Blomkvist> as he faces the family tree. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1245
02:11:42,00 --> 02:11:47,50
Peering at a photo of SOMEONE<Anita> Vanger. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1246
02:11:44,00 --> 02:11:50,50

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1247
02:11:47,00 --> 02:11:53,50
where the heavy set techie sleeps with his mouth hanging open. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1249
02:11:52,00 --> 02:11:58,50
Across the aisle, SOMEONE sits beside SOMEONE who wakes from a nap. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1250
02:11:55,00 --> 02:12:02,50
At night, in a pleasant upscale neighborhood of row houses 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1251
02:11:59,00 --> 02:12:04,50
a car pulls into a narrow drive. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1253
02:12:03,00 --> 02:12:10,50
In a van parked across the street, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> sees the arrival and talks into a walkie-talkie. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1254
02:12:08,00 --> 02:12:15,50

The heavyset techie and SOMEONE come up the steps 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1256
02:12:15,00 --> 02:12:21,50
followed by a tall young man who shuts the railing gate. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1257
02:12:18,00 --> 02:12:25,50
They cross the street with their hands in their pockets and climb into the van. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1258
02:12:22,00 --> 02:12:29,50
The door startles SOMEONE<Blomkvist>. SOMEONE<Salander> sits beside him. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1259
02:12:29,00 --> 02:12:33,50
He nods. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1260

He steps out. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1261
02:12:35,00 --> 02:12:41,50
In the back the techie lights a cigarette and blows smoke at the tall young man. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1262
02:12:39,00 --> 02:12:45,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> crosses the street and walks up to the front door.

SOMEONE<Salander> peers out the passenger window. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1264
02:12:44,00 --> 02:12:52,50
As an anxious SOMEONE gazes in the van's direction, SOMEONE answers the front door. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1265
02:13:18,00 --> 02:13:22,50
She shuts the door. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1266
02:13:19,00 --> 02:13:25,50
An antenna protrudes from the van's roof. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1267
02:13:22,00 --> 02:13:28,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> returns to the vehicle and gets behind the wheel.

02:13:40,00 --> 02:13:44,50
and navigates a shopping site. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1271
02:13:43,00 --> 02:13:47,50
The techie takes a drag. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1272
02:13:45,00 --> 02:13:49,50
SOMEONE<Salander> and SOMEONE<Blomkvist> trade a look. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1273
02:13:47,00 --> 02:13:54,50
Now in a hotel, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> joins SOMEONE<Salander> on a bed where she uses her laptop.

02:14:20,00 --> 02:14:28,50
Her naked upper body exposed, SOMEONE<Salander> straddles SOMEONE<Blomkvist> posting her arm on a headboard. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1279
02:14:25,00 --> 02:14:31,50
Her black hair dangles over the top of his head. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1280
02:14:32,00 --> 02:14:37,50
She collapses over his right side. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1281
02:14:40,00 --> 02:14:45,50
She notices his distant gaze. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1282
02:14:42,00 --> 02:14:49,50
The next day SOMEONE<Blomkvist> enters the investment bank and marches upstairs.

Her jaw goes slack. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1285
02:14:59,00 --> 02:15:05,50
Now, SOMEONE<Blomkvist> and SOMEONE<Harriet> sit in a park.

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1318
02:20:06,00 --> 02:20:11,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> and SOMEONE<Salander> look on solemnly.

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1353
02:25:22,00 --> 02:25:27,50
As the desk clerk scans the passport its image appears on a monitor under the fake name SOMEONE<Irene>.

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1358

02:26:03,00 --> 02:26:12,50

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1360
02:26:10,00 --> 02:26:17,50
she tilts her face away from a security camera. They reach a man's office.

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1367
02:27:04,00 --> 02:27:11,50
In an office, the disguised woman reveals the bonds inside one of the bags. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1368
02:27:15,00 --> 02:27:23,50
She sips from a teacup as the bespectacled banker punches numbers into a calculator. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1369
02:27:20,00 --> 02:27:28,50
Noticing a lipstick smear near the cups rim, SOMEONE<Salander> wipes it away with a gloved finger. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1370
02:27:25,00 --> 02:27:30,50
The bank official shows her the calculator.

Now, at the Millennium offices SOMEONE<Blomkvist>, SOMEONE<Erica>, and their colleagues watch a news report. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1393
02:29:03,00 --> 02:29:08,50
SOMEONE<Blomkvist> looks out a window then exits.

She glances away with a faint smile. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1398
02:29:51,00 --> 02:29:57,50

02:29:56,00 --> 02:30:02,50
In the Millennium offices a goateed man approaches SOMEONE<Erica>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1401
02:30:02,00 --> 02:30:07,50
She turns from the window. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1402
02:30:04,00 --> 02:30:16,50
Now, in his apartment, SOMEONE<Palmgren> sits across a chessboard from SOMEONE<Salander>. As he feebly inches a pawn forward she helps him, then lowers her gaze and bites her thumb. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1403
02:30:35,00 --> 02:30:41,50
He crooks his eyebrow in an intrigued look. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1404
02:30:41,00 --> 02:30:45,50
Now SOMEONE<Blomkvist> enters a SOMEONE<café>. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1405
02:31:04,00 --> 02:31:10,50
Turning his back to the TV he opens a newspaper. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1406
02:31:08,00 --> 02:31:15,50
Now, a tailor unzips a garment bag and shows SOMEONE<Salander> a black leather jacket. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1407
02:31:12,00 --> 02:31:18,50
She compares it to SOMEONE's<Blomkvist’s> jacket in the photo of him and SOMEONE<Erica>.

02:31:23,00 --> 02:31:28,50
Zips the bag back up. SOMEONE<Salander> gives a wistful look. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1409
02:31:26,00 --> 02:31:34,50
Now, at her apartment she intently writes a message inside a card then slides it into an envelope. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1410
02:31:33,00 --> 02:31:41,50
The card's cover shows a horse bending its neck down as a child bundled against the cold pats its head. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1411
02:31:39,00 --> 02:31:45,50
SOMEONE<Salander> writes an M on the front of the envelope then underlines it. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1412
02:31:42,00 --> 02:31:46,50
She stares off. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1413
02:31:44,00 --> 02:31:48,50
Snow drifts to the ground as SOMEONE<Salander> glides her motorcycle down a hill and parks across the street from SOMEONE's<Blomkvist’s> apartment building. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1415
02:31:56,00 --> 02:32:01,50
Dismounting, she removes her helmet. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1416
02:31:58,00 --> 02:32:05,50
Then takes the garment bag with her gift off the bike's rear cargo rack. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1417
02:32:06,00 --> 02:32:15,50
She sees SOMEONE<Blomkvist> and SOMEONE<Erica> leaving the building and watches unnoticed as he drapes an arm over her shoulders. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1418
02:32:13,00 --> 02:32:20,50
The couple heads down a walkway to a waiting taxi at the top of a hill. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1419
02:32:23,00 --> 02:32:31,50
SOMEONE<Salander> watches woundedly as they climb into the cab, then lowers her heartbroken gaze. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1420
02:32:30,00 --> 02:32:38,50
Turning away, she tosses SOMEONE's<Blomkvist's> gift into a dumpster against the side of a building. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1421
02:32:35,00 --> 02:32:40,50
She glances at the cab as it drives off, 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1422
02:32:38,00 --> 02:32:43,50
then dawns her helmet and mounts her bike. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1423
02:32:44,00 --> 02:32:53,50
She speeds off down the cobblestone street, her figure disappearing from view as she rounds a corner. 

THE_GIRL_WITH_THE_DRAGON_TATTOO_DVS1424
02:32:50,00 --> 02:32:59,50
Exterior lamps on buildings catch falling flakes of snow in their pale shafts of light as they drift to the ground.
