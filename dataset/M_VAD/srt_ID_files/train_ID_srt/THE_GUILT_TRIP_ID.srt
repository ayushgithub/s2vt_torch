THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS26
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:47,50
In an office building, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS27
00:02:48,00 --> 00:02:56,50
A receptionist shows SOMEONE<Andrew> into a conference room, where three executives wait around a large table. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS28
00:03:21,00 --> 00:03:26,50
The executives stare at him blankly. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS29
00:03:50,00 --> 00:03:55,50
From his briefcase, he pulls out a coconut, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS30
00:03:54,00 --> 00:03:58,50
a potted plant, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS31
00:03:58,00 --> 00:04:02,50
and soy sauce. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS32
00:04:11,00 --> 00:04:16,50
He holds up a labeled spray bottle. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS33
00:04:47,00 --> 00:04:53,50
SOMEONE<Andrew> hangs his head and repacks his briefcase. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS34
00:06:30,00 --> 00:06:34,50
At dinner, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS36
00:08:02,00 --> 00:08:07,50
she fills up a bottle with tap water. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS37
00:08:15,00 --> 00:08:20,50
Grimacing, SOMEONE<Andy> sets down his water. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS38
00:09:30,00 --> 00:09:38,50
It's 11:30 and SOMEONE<Andy>, a chubby man with curly dark hair, lies awake in bed. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS39
00:09:41,00 --> 00:09:48,50
He goes to his mother's room to find her fast asleep, with her reading glasses still on. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS40
00:09:45,00 --> 00:09:51,50
The home movie's playing on the television. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS41
00:09:49,00 --> 00:09:55,50
Beside her bed is a framed photo of her and SOMEONE<Andy>. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS42
00:10:13,00 --> 00:10:23,50
After watching for a moment, SOMEONE<Andy> switches off the TV and removes a packet of M&Ms from his mother's bed before leaving the room. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS44
00:10:25,00 --> 00:10:31,50
they both arrive at the Montclair Mature Singles Club, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS45
00:10:28,00 --> 00:10:35,50
where middle-aged men and women are mingling with each other and engaging in conversation. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS47
00:10:35,00 --> 00:10:39,50
SOMEONE's mom takes her name tag. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS49
00:10:46,00 --> 00:10:52,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> sits at a table sipping a drink. She looks around at the other guests, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS50
00:10:49,00 --> 00:10:54,50
thoroughly unimpressed. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS51
00:10:51,00 --> 00:10:57,50
Nearby, an older woman winks and smiles in SOMEONE's<Andy's> direction. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS52
00:10:55,00 --> 00:11:01,50
Realizing her advances are directed at him, he hurries away. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS53
00:10:58,00 --> 00:11:04,50
Later, a series of men try to approach SOMEONE<Joyce>. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS54
00:11:12,00 --> 00:11:22,50
SOMEONE<Andy> sighs as he sits at the bar, watching his mother turn down one man after another, until they stop approaching her altogether. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS55
00:11:19,00 --> 00:11:25,50
Later, SOMEONE<Andy> and his mom eat ice cream at the dining room table. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS56
00:15:48,00 --> 00:15:54,50
SOMEONE<Andy> stares at his mom for a moment, then squeezes his eyes shut. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS57
00:15:54,00 --> 00:15:59,50
SOMEONE<Andy> sits motionless at the table. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS58
00:16:43,00 --> 00:16:51,50
In his room, SOMEONE<Andy> opens his laptop and types "J&R Advertising" into a Bing search engine. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS59
00:16:51,00 --> 00:16:57,50
Using a phone number off of an East Coast Offices search result, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS60
00:16:54,00 --> 00:16:59,50
he places a call. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS61
00:18:15,00 --> 00:18:21,50
SOMEONE<Andy> hangs up and furrows his brow. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS62
00:18:48,00 --> 00:18:54,50
SOMEONE<Andy> avoids meeting SOMEONE's<Joyce's> eyes. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS63
00:19:28,00 --> 00:19:33,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> flicks her eyes from side to side. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS64
00:19:35,00 --> 00:19:40,50
SOMEONE<Andy> nods repeatedly, his lips pursed. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS66
00:21:40,00 --> 00:21:44,50
SOMEONE<Andy> stumbles over their luggage. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS67
00:22:48,00 --> 00:22:52,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> smirks. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS68
00:23:02,00 --> 00:23:09,50
They're driving a tiny red car. SOMEONE<Joyce> reaches in the backseat. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS69
00:23:29,00 --> 00:23:34,50
He inserts an audio CD. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS70
00:24:50,00 --> 00:24:54,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> smiles warmly. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS71
00:25:05,00 --> 00:25:08,50
She shrugs. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS72
00:25:38,00 --> 00:25:44,50
SOMEONE's<Andy's> expression softens, then turns thoughtful again. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS73
00:26:03,00 --> 00:26:10,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> fidgets with her purse, as she waits with SOMEONE<Andy> in an office lobby. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS74
00:26:28,00 --> 00:26:34,50
She takes a small hook out of her purse and hangs the bag on the table. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS75
00:26:33,00 --> 00:26:40,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> licks a few fingers, and attempts to reach over and smooth SOMEONE's<Andy's> hair. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS76
00:26:52,00 --> 00:26:57,50
SOMEONE<Andy> regains his composure. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS77
00:27:18,00 --> 00:27:23,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> takes out her phone and puts on her glasses. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS78
00:27:29,00 --> 00:27:34,50
SOMEONE<Andy> frowns and raises an eyebrow at his mother. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS79
00:27:35,00 --> 00:27:39,50
He throws his hands up. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS80
00:28:04,00 --> 00:28:09,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> peeks around a corner at SOMEONE<Andy>. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS81
00:28:37,00 --> 00:28:45,50
SOMEONE<Andy> leaves the conference room, downcast, and sees SOMEONE<Joyce> eagerly waiting for him at the front desk. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS82
00:28:52,00 --> 00:28:58,50
Back in the car, SOMEONE<Joyce> plays her audio book. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS83
00:29:15,00 --> 00:29:20,50
SOMEONE leaves another meeting, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS84
00:29:18,00 --> 00:29:23,50
and once again faces his mother. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS85
00:29:31,00 --> 00:29:35,50
They make a U-turn. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS86
00:29:34,00 --> 00:29:40,50
SOMEONE<Andy> waits in the car, outside a McDonald's. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS87
00:29:47,00 --> 00:29:56,50
Back on the road, at an oncoming intersection, SOMEONE<Joyce> spots a hitchhiker signaling for a lift. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS88
00:30:01,00 --> 00:30:06,50
SOMEONE<Andy> rolls his eyes. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS90
00:30:21,00 --> 00:30:26,50
SOMEONE<Andy> steps up to the hotel's front desk. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS91
00:30:34,00 --> 00:30:39,50
The receptionist winks at SOMEONE<Andy>. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS92
00:33:41,00 --> 00:33:47,50
They both settle into their twin beds and SOMEONE<Joyce> turns out the light. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS93
00:33:44,00 --> 00:33:51,50
She then reaches for the bedside table and picks up a small packet. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS94
00:34:04,00 --> 00:34:09,50
SOMEONE<Andy> looks over at his mother. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS95
00:34:28,00 --> 00:34:33,50
SOMEONE<Andy> scowls and closes his eyes. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS96
00:34:33,00 --> 00:34:39,50
The next morning, SOMEONE<Andy> wakes up and stretches his arms. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS97
00:34:36,00 --> 00:34:43,50
Squinting in the bright daylight streaming in through the windows, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS98
00:34:40,00 --> 00:34:46,50
he looks over to see SOMEONE, dressed in a plum-colored robe, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS99
00:34:43,00 --> 00:34:49,50
smiling at him from her bed, flipping through a magazine. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS100
00:34:50,00 --> 00:34:55,50
SOMEONE<Andy> blinks, then stares up at the ceiling. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS101
00:34:53,00 --> 00:34:59,50
Back on the road, they resume listening to Middlesex. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS102
00:35:06,00 --> 00:35:10,50
SOMEONE<Andy> turns it off. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS103
00:35:16,00 --> 00:35:23,50
That night, they drive through a blizzard, the windshield wipers working through a layer of snow. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS104
00:36:33,00 --> 00:36:39,50
He checks the tires in a strip-club parking lot. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS105
00:37:03,00 --> 00:37:11,50
SOMEONE<Andy> sits with his head down, ignoring the pole dancers in the dimly lit strip club. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS106
00:37:23,00 --> 00:37:27,50
SOMEONE<Andy> grimaces. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS107
00:38:43,00 --> 00:38:49,50
Moonlight picks at the ice with her shoe. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS108
00:40:04,00 --> 00:40:08,50
At Jessica and her husband's house, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS109
00:41:40,00 --> 00:41:46,50
as SOMEONE<Andy> looks away, SOMEONE<Joyce> slowly glances over at him. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS110
00:41:47,00 --> 00:41:53,50
SOMEONE<Andy> and SOMEONE<Joyce> drive on a bridge over the Mississippi River. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS111
00:41:50,00 --> 00:41:55,50
SOMEONE, his brow furrowed, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS112
00:41:52,00 --> 00:41:58,50
peers at his mother and scoffs as he shakes his head. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS113
00:41:58,00 --> 00:42:02,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> bites her lower lip. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS114
00:42:06,00 --> 00:42:11,50
SOMEONE<Andy> keeps his eyes fixed on the road. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS115
00:42:08,00 --> 00:42:13,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> shrugs hesitantly. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS116
00:42:44,00 --> 00:42:51,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> opens her mouth as if to say something else, but stops herself. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS117
00:42:49,00 --> 00:42:56,50
With a resigned expression, she leans on her hand and looks out the window beside her. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS118
00:42:58,00 --> 00:43:03,50
SOMEONE<Andy> drives up to a wide building. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS119
00:43:00,00 --> 00:43:06,50
Inside, there's a large, open-seating area. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS120
00:43:03,00 --> 00:43:10,50
Uniformed Costco employees approach people seated at scattered tables. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS121
00:43:08,00 --> 00:43:15,50
SOMEONE<Andy> sits at one of them, going over his notes, and muttering quietly to himself. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS122
00:43:14,00 --> 00:43:21,50
He sees his mother taking a look around as she approaches his table. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS123
00:44:43,00 --> 00:44:47,50
SOMEONE<Andy> scowls. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS124
00:44:45,00 --> 00:44:50,50
SOMEONE<Ryan> jots something down in a notepad. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS125
00:46:49,00 --> 00:46:56,50
People at the other tables turn to look and SOMEONE's<Ryan's> face falls. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS126
00:46:55,00 --> 00:47:01,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> looks sternly at her son, her glasses sitting low on her nose. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS127
00:46:59,00 --> 00:47:06,50
He sulks and avoids her gaze, shaking his head slightly. Back in the car, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS128
00:47:07,00 --> 00:47:12,50
SOMEONE<Andy> purses his lips. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS129
00:47:18,00 --> 00:47:24,50
SOMEONE<Andy> grits his teeth, as he continues driving off into the sunset. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS130
00:47:22,00 --> 00:47:28,50
Later that night, they pull into a motel parking lot. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS131
00:47:25,00 --> 00:47:32,50
A pale-blue neon sign reads "Abilene Motor Lodge Lounge. " 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS132
00:47:30,00 --> 00:47:37,50
In their room, SOMEONE<Joyce> emerges from the bathroom, holding up a few small bottles. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS133
00:47:40,00 --> 00:47:46,50
She places the bottles in her open suitcase lying on her twin bed. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS134
00:47:44,00 --> 00:47:50,50
Sulking, SOMEONE<Andy> sips a dark-colored drink from a plastic glass. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS135
00:47:54,00 --> 00:47:59,50
SOMEONE<Andy> ignores her and gazes at the floor. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS136
00:47:57,00 --> 00:48:01,50
He takes another sip. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS137
00:47:58,00 --> 00:48:04,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> taps her fingertips together, looking around the room. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS138
00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:17,50
She edges past SOMEONE<Andy>, and places the water bottle on a table beside him, then backs away. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS139
00:48:25,00 --> 00:48:29,50
He holds up a hand. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS140
00:48:44,00 --> 00:48:48,50
He goes back to his drink. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS141
00:48:46,00 --> 00:48:52,50
SOMEONE<Joyce>, lost for words, sits down at the foot of her bed. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS142
00:48:59,00 --> 00:49:06,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> shakes her head in disappointment and her expression hardens. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS143
00:49:21,00 --> 00:49:25,50
She gestures at SOMEONE<Andy>. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS144
00:50:22,00 --> 00:50:28,50
SOMEONE<Andy> breathes heavily as he watches SOMEONE<Joyce> storm out of the room. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS145
00:50:26,00 --> 00:50:33,50
Later, he sits on the hotel bed, blankly watching the weather forecast. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS146
00:50:30,00 --> 00:50:35,50
The bed opposite his remains empty. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS147
00:50:34,00 --> 00:50:44,50
After a while, he looks at his wristwatch, then steps out onto the balcony, and leans on the railing, looking down around the parking lot. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS148
00:50:47,00 --> 00:50:52,50
He spots someone entering the motel lounge. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS149
00:52:49,00 --> 00:52:56,50
SOMEONE<Jimmy> punches SOMEONE<Andy> in the face, causing SOMEONE<Andy> to black out. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS151
00:52:54,00 --> 00:53:00,50
The next day, SOMEONE<Joyce> and her son are back in the car and on the road. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS152
00:52:57,00 --> 00:53:04,50
SOMEONE, sporting a large mottled bruise on his upper cheek, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS153
00:53:01,00 --> 00:53:06,50
casts furtive glances at his mother. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS154
00:53:05,00 --> 00:53:11,50
SOMEONE looks to the ceiling, bites her lip, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS155
00:53:08,00 --> 00:53:14,50
then goes back to staring listlessly out the window. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS156
00:53:16,00 --> 00:53:21,50
He looks at her with a half-smile. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS157
00:53:37,00 --> 00:53:42,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> nods and smiles. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS158
00:53:55,00 --> 00:53:59,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> looks off into the distance. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS159
00:54:07,00 --> 00:54:15,50
After a moment, a small smile forms on SOMEONE's<Joyce's> lips, and she nods slightly to herself. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS160
00:54:14,00 --> 00:54:23,50
Then they both notice a billboard, along the highway for a steak ranch located off the next exit. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS161
00:54:20,00 --> 00:54:26,50
It reads "Steak Your Claim. Claim Your Steak. " 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS162
00:54:26,00 --> 00:54:30,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> rolls her eyes. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS163
00:54:30,00 --> 00:54:35,50
In a Western-style restaurant, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS164
00:54:34,00 --> 00:54:38,50
a waitress hands them glasses of water. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS165
00:54:39,00 --> 00:54:44,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> watches her walk away. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS166
00:54:43,00 --> 00:54:48,50
SOMEONE<Andy> looks down at the table, with a slight frown. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS167
00:55:37,00 --> 00:55:43,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> takes a deep breath and lays her menu down on the table. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS168
00:55:55,00 --> 00:55:59,50
She smiles. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS169
00:56:11,00 --> 00:56:15,50
SOMEONE<Andy> starts to fidget. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS171
00:57:51,00 --> 00:57:56,50
He hands her an enormous charred steak. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS172
00:58:03,00 --> 00:58:10,50
SOMEONE<Andy> applauds from the nearby bar. SOMEONE<Joyce> holds up her hands, overwhelmed. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS173
00:58:12,00 --> 00:58:18,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> readies a napkin and picks the greens off her plate. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS174
00:58:24,00 --> 00:58:30,50
She holds up a morsel on her fork, then pops it into her mouth. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS175
00:58:35,00 --> 00:58:41,50
A timer on the mantelpiece behind SOMEONE<Joyce> ticks down. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS176
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:48,50
There's around a quarter of her steak remaining, as she stuffs a forkful of potato and a piece of bread into her mouth and struggles to chew. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS177
00:58:46,00 --> 00:58:52,50
SOMEONE<Andy> winces as she pauses to remove her jacket. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS178
00:58:49,00 --> 00:58:54,50
She sees him and whispers. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS179
00:58:54,00 --> 00:59:00,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> forks in another mouthful and flutters her hands anxiously. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS180
00:59:03,00 --> 00:59:10,50
A man in a blazer walks along the bar, smiling as he watches SOMEONE<Joyce> eat. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS181
00:59:07,00 --> 00:59:13,50
He blocks SOMEONE's<Andy's> view, who strains to look around him. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS182
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:24,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> lulls back in her chair. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS183
01:00:07,00 --> 01:00:14,50
SOMEONE<Ben> approaches the stage and pulls up a chair beside SOMEONE<Joyce>, who is focused on eating. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS185
01:01:44,00 --> 01:01:48,50
Three minutes left, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS186
01:02:05,00 --> 01:02:11,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> leans forward on the table and shovels in the last of the steak. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS187
01:02:12,00 --> 01:02:17,50
Lastly, she reaches for the shrimp cocktail. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS188
01:02:23,00 --> 01:02:27,50
She stands and raises the glass. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS190
01:02:32,00 --> 01:02:37,50
She downs the cocktail sauce in one swig. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS191
01:02:36,00 --> 01:02:42,50
SOMEONE<Andy>, SOMEONE<Ben>, and the crowd throw their hands in the air, beaming. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS192
01:02:42,00 --> 01:02:48,50
SOMEONE<Ben> pats SOMEONE's<Joyce's> shoulder and she pulls her son in for a hug. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS193
01:02:47,00 --> 01:02:51,50
Later, outside, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS194
01:03:54,00 --> 01:03:58,50
SOMEONE<Ben> grins in response. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS195
01:04:15,00 --> 01:04:20,50
SOMEONE reaches into his jacket 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS196
01:04:18,00 --> 01:04:22,50
and hands her a card. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS197
01:04:20,00 --> 01:04:24,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> nods. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS198
01:04:24,00 --> 01:04:28,50
He smiles gently. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS199
01:04:26,00 --> 01:04:32,50
SOMEONE<Ben> touches the tip of his hat and walks to his truck. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS200
01:05:54,00 --> 01:05:58,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> inserts another CD. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS201
01:06:19,00 --> 01:06:27,50
Outside a convenience store, SOMEONE<Joyce> enters the wrong car, with a handful of candy. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS202
01:06:36,00 --> 01:06:41,50
She sees SOMEONE<Andy> and hurries towards him. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS203
01:06:40,00 --> 01:06:45,50
SOMEONE<Andy> sleeps while SOMEONE<Joyce> drives. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS205
01:07:00,00 --> 01:07:05,50
They drive through New Mexico. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS206
01:07:21,00 --> 01:07:29,50
Later, they stand facing a massive expanse of ridged rocky outcrops and cliffs. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS207
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:47,50
Their expressions soon turned bored and inattentive. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS208
01:07:48,00 --> 01:07:52,50
SOMEONE<Andy> shrugs. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS209
01:08:08,00 --> 01:08:16,50
Against an indigo sunset, their tiny car heads toward the neon city lights of Las Vegas. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS210
01:08:30,00 --> 01:08:37,50
They take in the bright lights and glittering signs of the Las Vegas Strip. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS211
01:08:47,00 --> 01:08:52,50
They arrive at Caesars Palace. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS212
01:09:26,00 --> 01:09:31,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> walks away, smiling. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS213
01:09:31,00 --> 01:09:35,50
SOMEONE<Andy> looks for her. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS214
01:09:35,00 --> 01:09:40,50
SOMEONE<Andy> finds SOMEONE<Joyce> at a slot machine. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS215
01:10:35,00 --> 01:10:41,50
Later, SOMEONE<Joyce> enters their hotel room, holding a half-finished drink. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS216
01:10:39,00 --> 01:10:44,50
She carefully closes the door and tiptoes in. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS217
01:10:44,00 --> 01:10:50,50
SOMEONE<Andy> lies in bed as daylight shines through the windows. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS218
01:10:57,00 --> 01:11:01,50
SOMEONE<Andy> rubs his eyes. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS219
01:12:57,00 --> 01:13:02,50
SOMEONE's<Joyce's> face falls and she looks down. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS220
01:13:13,00 --> 01:13:19,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> nods slowly and closes her eyes. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS221
01:13:36,00 --> 01:13:42,50
She joins her hands together and rests them against her forehead. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS222
01:14:00,00 --> 01:14:06,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> regards her son, then fetches her handbag from the hallway. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS223
01:14:26,00 --> 01:14:31,50
SOMEONE watches her leave the room, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS224
01:14:29,00 --> 01:14:34,50
then drops his head and sighs. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS225
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:37,50
Later, SOMEONE<Andy> waits in the hotel's convention hall. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS226
01:14:35,00 --> 01:14:42,50
Other participants are seated or milling around preparing for their presentations. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS227
01:14:39,00 --> 01:14:44,50
A man with a clipboard approaches. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS228
01:14:45,00 --> 01:14:49,50
SOMEONE<Andy> purses his lips. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS229
01:14:49,00 --> 01:14:55,50
He picks up his briefcase and follows the man through the partition doors. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS230
01:15:16,00 --> 01:15:21,50
A woman tries to apply makeup to SOMEONE<Andy>. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS231
01:16:10,00 --> 01:16:16,50
Back at the now empty casino, SOMEONE<Joyce> sits at her slot machine. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS232
01:16:13,00 --> 01:16:21,50
She takes off her glasses and pinches the bridge of her nose before smiling to herself. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS233
01:16:18,00 --> 01:16:24,50
Then she quietly enters the side of the convention hall, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS234
01:16:21,00 --> 01:16:26,50
where SOMEONE<Andy> is continuing his presentation. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS235
01:16:51,00 --> 01:16:59,50
SOMEONE<Andy> sees one executive texting on her cell phone and another absently taking a drink of water. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS236
01:16:57,00 --> 01:17:01,50
He chuckles to himself. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS237
01:17:40,00 --> 01:17:44,50
The executives smile. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS238
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:17,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> grins proudly. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS239
01:18:19,00 --> 01:18:26,50
SOMEONE<Andy> pours some ScioClean into a glass, holds it up towards SOMEONE<Joyce>, and drinks it. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS241
01:18:28,00 --> 01:18:33,50
The executives whisper to each other. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS242
01:18:48,00 --> 01:18:53,50
SOMEONE<Amy> raises her eyebrows. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS243
01:18:53,00 --> 01:18:57,50
The executives chuckle. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS244
01:19:51,00 --> 01:19:56,50
SOMEONE<Andy> leaves with SOMEONE<Joyce>. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS245
01:20:57,00 --> 01:21:03,50
They drive along the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS246
01:21:52,00 --> 01:21:56,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> widens her eyes. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS247
01:22:01,00 --> 01:22:07,50
SOMEONE<Andy> smiles, but SOMEONE<Joyce> just gapes at her phone. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS248
01:22:37,00 --> 01:22:41,50
She puts on some lipstick. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS249
01:22:48,00 --> 01:22:56,50
They drive through a suburban neighborhood with wide green front lawns and large shady trees. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS250
01:22:58,00 --> 01:23:05,50
SOMEONE<Andy> parks by the side of the road and rolls down his window. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS251
01:23:35,00 --> 01:23:40,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> smiles at SOMEONE<Andy>. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS252
01:23:52,00 --> 01:23:57,50
A man in his thirties opens the door. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS253
01:24:28,00 --> 01:24:34,50
Realization dawns on SOMEONE's<Andy's> face. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS254
01:24:53,00 --> 01:24:59,50
SOMEONE's<Joyce's> expression freezes and she looks to the floor. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS255
01:25:00,00 --> 01:25:06,50
She turns aside and SOMEONE<Andy> places a hand on her shoulder. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS256
01:26:10,00 --> 01:26:15,50
SOMEONE<Andy> furrows his brow. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS257
01:26:51,00 --> 01:26:57,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> and her son glance at one another, smiling. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS258
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:05,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Joyce> holds on to her son's arm, as they cross the street and head toward their car. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS259
01:27:03,00 --> 01:27:08,50
SOMEONE<Andy> holds the door open for her and she gets in. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS260
01:27:15,00 --> 01:27:21,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> rests her head back in the seat, as a warm grin forms on her face. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS261
01:27:19,00 --> 01:27:24,50
She pulls SOMEONE<Andy> close and kisses him. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS262
01:27:30,00 --> 01:27:35,50
They both share a smile before driving off. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS263
01:27:38,00 --> 01:27:47,50
Listening to SOMEONE's<Joyce's> audio book, they arrive at the airport car rental and steer into the return lane. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS264
01:27:53,00 --> 01:27:57,50
SOMEONE<Andy> rolls down the window. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS265
01:27:56,00 --> 01:28:00,50
He presses Play. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS266
01:28:11,00 --> 01:28:16,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> and SOMEONE<Andy> listen intently. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS267
01:28:19,00 --> 01:28:26,50
Inside the airport, they walk up to the digital departure board. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS268
01:29:26,00 --> 01:29:30,50
SOMEONE<Andy> nods. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS269
01:30:25,00 --> 01:30:30,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> hugs SOMEONE<Andy>, holding on to him tightly. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS270
01:30:28,00 --> 01:30:34,50
She kisses him on the cheek and smiles to herself, holding back tears. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS271
01:30:39,00 --> 01:30:45,50
She finally lets go and holds him at arm's length. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS272
01:30:42,00 --> 01:30:49,50
She holds a finger up to her face, as if just remembering something. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS273
01:30:53,00 --> 01:30:59,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> smiles again, genuinely touched by SOMEONE's<Andy's> declaration. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS274
01:31:00,00 --> 01:31:06,50
SOMEONE<Joyce> touches a finger to her lips and waves goodbye to SOMEONE<Andy>. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS275
01:31:03,00 --> 01:31:11,50
As he watches her walk away, she takes out her cell phone from her purse and dials a number. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS276
01:31:17,00 --> 01:31:23,50
SOMEONE<Andy> takes out his cell phone and stares at it, waiting. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS277
01:31:26,00 --> 01:31:33,50
He looks from his mother to his phone and shrugs with a wry smile. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS278
01:31:32,00 --> 01:31:39,50
SOMEONE<Andy> picks up his briefcase and walks off into the bustling crowd. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS279
01:31:37,00 --> 01:31:48,50
The end credits start to roll over the scene, as a man pushes his mother on a wheelchair, and a teenager offers his mom a sip from his juice box. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS280
01:31:46,00 --> 01:31:52,50
Nearby, a middle-aged man talks to his mother over the phone. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS281
01:31:50,00 --> 01:31:57,50
And a boy runs before his mom, guiding her as they both haul their luggage. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS282
01:31:54,00 --> 01:32:03,50
A young boy sleeps, resting on a woman's shoulder. And a security guard guides another child to his mother, 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS283
01:32:00,00 --> 01:32:05,50
who kneels on the floor to hug him. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS284
01:32:03,00 --> 01:32:09,50
The scene fades to black and credits continue to scroll. 

THE_GUILT_TRIP_DVS285
01:32:19,00 --> 01:32:26,50
Various clips of SOMEONE<Andy> and SOMEONE<Joyce> driving in their car appear beside the credits.
