THE_VOW_DVS34
00:02:42,00 --> 00:02:47,50
Headlights glow behind them. 

THE_VOW_DVS35
00:02:45,00 --> 00:02:49,50
The couple kisses passionately. 

THE_VOW_DVS37
00:02:52,00 --> 00:03:01,50
The driver side window shatters. The slipping truck veers right, and the pushed car slams into something. 

THE_VOW_DVS38
00:02:58,00 --> 00:03:06,50
Still seen in slow motion the brunette woman appears weightless as she drifts headfirst toward the windshield. 

THE_VOW_DVS40
00:03:06,00 --> 00:03:11,50
It shatters on contact. She lands halfway outside, face down on the hood. 

THE_VOW_DVS41
00:03:09,00 --> 00:03:18,50
The front bumpers crushed against a utility pole.  

THE_VOW_DVS45
00:03:27,00 --> 00:03:35,50
Later, emergency personnel wheel the unconscious couple into a hospital on stretchers. 

THE_VOW_DVS46
00:03:32,00 --> 00:03:37,50
Words appear. Inspired by true events. 

THE_VOW_DVS47
00:03:35,00 --> 00:03:42,50
In the ER a doctor intubates the wife while another cuts the husband's shirt. 

THE_VOW_DVS48
00:03:39,00 --> 00:03:49,50
In a corridor, three guys and two women anxiously heed the words of a nurse. The husband briefly opens his eyes. 

THE_VOW_DVS49
00:03:57,00 --> 00:04:01,50
Four years ago. 

THE_VOW_DVS50
00:03:58,00 --> 00:04:04,50
In a government building the broad shouldered man waits in line. 

THE_VOW_DVS51
00:04:03,00 --> 00:04:10,50
He sees his future wife with dark chin length hair leaving the counter ahead of him. 

THE_VOW_DVS52
00:04:07,00 --> 00:04:13,50
As she passes, he glances after her. Their gazes meet. 

THE_VOW_DVS53
00:04:14,00 --> 00:04:19,50
They share a smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS54
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:22,50
Now he catches up with her, wearing a hip straw fedora. 

THE_VOW_DVS55
00:04:20,00 --> 00:04:25,50
She turns and finds him right there. 

THE_VOW_DVS56
00:04:24,00 --> 00:04:28,50
He holds it out. 

THE_VOW_DVS57
00:04:31,00 --> 00:04:36,50
He notices a sticker on her car. 

THE_VOW_DVS58
00:04:40,00 --> 00:04:46,50
She smiles, he drops his gaze and grins sheepishly. 

THE_VOW_DVS59
00:04:51,00 --> 00:04:56,50
She opens her car door. 

THE_VOW_DVS60
00:05:19,00 --> 00:05:23,50
She looks him in the eye. 

THE_VOW_DVS61
00:05:36,00 --> 00:05:41,50
Considering, she allows an amused smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS62
00:05:41,00 --> 00:05:46,50
She nods and he grins brightly. 

THE_VOW_DVS63
00:05:45,00 --> 00:05:51,50
She closes her driver side door and triggers her keychain remote. 

THE_VOW_DVS64
00:05:50,00 --> 00:05:56,50
Later in a dine-in spot called SOMEONE Mnemonic, 

THE_VOW_DVS65
00:05:53,00 --> 00:05:59,50
SOMEONE<Leo> hides two chocolates from a box behind his back. 

THE_VOW_DVS66
00:06:02,00 --> 00:06:06,50
They each take a bite from a chocolate. 

THE_VOW_DVS67
00:06:05,00 --> 00:06:10,50
She offers her glass of red wine. 

THE_VOW_DVS68
00:06:07,00 --> 00:06:15,50
As he takes a sip, she plucks the straw fedora off his head and tries it on herself. 

THE_VOW_DVS69
00:06:15,00 --> 00:06:22,50
He tweaks the brim lower on her brow, and she wipes chocolate off his mouth. 

THE_VOW_DVS70
00:06:20,00 --> 00:06:29,50
At another SOMEONE<café>, a pale and red-nosed SOMEONE<Paige> shrugs her open sweater onto her shoulders and serves drinks. 

THE_VOW_DVS71
00:06:26,00 --> 00:06:32,50
She frowns at a box left on a table by a window. 

THE_VOW_DVS72
00:06:29,00 --> 00:06:35,50
She wipes her nose with a tissue, then heads over. 

THE_VOW_DVS73
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:37,50
Finding a photo of herself on the box's lid, 

THE_VOW_DVS74
00:06:35,00 --> 00:06:42,50
she lifts her gaze and sees her handsome companion standing outside in the pouring rain. 

THE_VOW_DVS75
00:06:40,00 --> 00:06:45,50
He gestures and she opens the gift. 

THE_VOW_DVS76
00:06:43,00 --> 00:06:48,50
She reads a note on a box of tissues. 

THE_VOW_DVS77
00:06:46,00 --> 00:06:50,50
She finds medicine. 

THE_VOW_DVS78
00:06:48,00 --> 00:06:54,50
She takes out a photo of SOMEONE<Leo> holding a guitar. 

THE_VOW_DVS79
00:06:53,00 --> 00:07:01,50
Holding his gaze, she presses the photo to her chest. Finding another note, she reads. 

THE_VOW_DVS80
00:06:59,00 --> 00:07:07,50
She pulls out a sexy lingerie bask with a black laced trimmed bust. 

THE_VOW_DVS81
00:07:04,00 --> 00:07:11,50
Holding it up, she purses her lips and mocks a seductive expression. 

THE_VOW_DVS82
00:07:08,00 --> 00:07:12,50
SOMEONE<Leo> grins. 

THE_VOW_DVS83
00:07:09,00 --> 00:07:15,50
SOMEONE<Paige> glances around, then hurriedly lowers the lingerie. 

THE_VOW_DVS84
00:07:13,00 --> 00:07:18,50
With a wave, SOMEONE<Leo> heads away. 

THE_VOW_DVS85
00:07:15,00 --> 00:07:22,50
SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> reflection in the window shows her loving smile as she waves back. 

THE_VOW_DVS87
00:07:21,00 --> 00:07:28,50
SOMEONE<Paige> holds an arm out of a car window, as SOMEONE<Leo> drives. She tickles him. 

THE_VOW_DVS88
00:07:27,00 --> 00:07:33,50
His eyes squint merrily as he leans back laughing. 

THE_VOW_DVS89
00:07:31,00 --> 00:07:39,50
SOMEONE<Paige> beams at him, SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> grin wilts and he clenches his jaw. SOMEONE<Paige> stares. 

THE_VOW_DVS90
00:07:43,00 --> 00:07:51,50
With a smile, SOMEONE<Paige> hits a switch. As she puts her power window up she holds SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS91
00:07:59,00 --> 00:08:07,50
In the present, a CT machine scans an unconscious SOMEONE<Paige>.  

THE_VOW_DVS94
00:08:37,00 --> 00:08:41,50
At his wife’s bedside, 

THE_VOW_DVS95
00:08:38,00 --> 00:08:45,50
he returns her wedding ring to her finger. A ventilator tube juts from her mouth.  

THE_VOW_DVS96
00:08:53,00 --> 00:09:02,50
In a flashback, SOMEONE<Leo> exits an apartment and finds her in an alley. 

THE_VOW_DVS97
00:09:00,00 --> 00:09:04,50
She feeds a stray cat. 

THE_VOW_DVS98
00:09:04,00 --> 00:09:08,50
She heads inside. 

THE_VOW_DVS99
00:09:16,00 --> 00:09:20,50
SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> three guy friends join them. 

THE_VOW_DVS100
00:09:40,00 --> 00:09:46,50
SOMEONE<Leo> serves her pancakes with words spelled in blueberries. 

THE_VOW_DVS101
00:09:47,00 --> 00:09:54,50
He adjusts a few berries, clarifying the message, Move in, with a question SOMEONE<mark>. 

THE_VOW_DVS102
00:09:51,00 --> 00:09:57,50
SOMEONE<Paige> beams and SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> guy friends swap happy looks. 

THE_VOW_DVS103
00:09:56,00 --> 00:10:00,50
She kisses SOMEONE<Leo>. 

THE_VOW_DVS104
00:09:58,00 --> 00:10:03,50
Now SOMEONE<Paige> wears a wedding veil. 

THE_VOW_DVS105
00:10:15,00 --> 00:10:20,50
They stand with friends in a gallery. 

THE_VOW_DVS106
00:10:35,00 --> 00:10:48,50
He takes out his vows. Grinning, SOMEONE<Paige> shows her identical SOMEONE<Café> Mnemonic menu. SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> guy friends, a brunette woman with a beauty SOMEONE<mark> and a few others witness the event. 

THE_VOW_DVS107
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:19,50
Beaming, SOMEONE<Paige> nods. Their friends smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS108
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:34,50
Their officiating friend spots two guards. 

THE_VOW_DVS109
00:11:37,00 --> 00:11:46,50
The newlyweds share a quick kiss, then flee the museum gallery with their small group of friends. The guards chase them. 

THE_VOW_DVS110
00:11:43,00 --> 00:11:52,50
Hurrying up a flight of stairs, SOMEONE<Leo> drops his SOMEONE<Café> Mnemonic menu and pauses to snatch it up. 

THE_VOW_DVS111
00:11:49,00 --> 00:11:56,50
Outside, he holds SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> hand as they race across a footbridge. 

THE_VOW_DVS112
00:11:53,00 --> 00:11:57,50
The guards give up the chase. 

THE_VOW_DVS113
00:11:55,00 --> 00:12:01,50
A sign below reads, The Art Institute of Chicago. 

THE_VOW_DVS115
00:11:59,00 --> 00:12:06,50
In Millennium Park, SOMEONE<Paige> and SOMEONE<Leo> kiss under the steel, bean shaped archway of cloud gate. 

THE_VOW_DVS116
00:12:03,00 --> 00:12:11,50
A wider view shows people strolling the plaza around the 40-foot high sculpture. 

THE_VOW_DVS117
00:12:08,00 --> 00:12:16,50
Their warped figures reflected on its seamless, chrome like surface. In another flashback, 

THE_VOW_DVS118
00:12:13,00 --> 00:12:20,50
SOMEONE<Paige> works a mound of clay on the table in an art studio. 

THE_VOW_DVS119
00:12:17,00 --> 00:12:22,50
Her pulled back hair is now shoulder length. 

THE_VOW_DVS120
00:12:20,00 --> 00:12:27,50
With a frustrated look, she smacks the unfinished sculpture, then shoves the table away. 

THE_VOW_DVS121
00:12:26,00 --> 00:12:31,50
SOMEONE<Leo> enters and turns off the stereo. 

THE_VOW_DVS122
00:12:32,00 --> 00:12:37,50
SOMEONE<Paige> stomps irritably. 

THE_VOW_DVS123
00:12:52,00 --> 00:12:58,50
SOMEONE<Leo> holds up a piece of clay, shaped like a person. 

THE_VOW_DVS124
00:12:57,00 --> 00:13:02,50
He makes the tiny figure dance. 

THE_VOW_DVS125
00:13:02,00 --> 00:13:07,50
SOMEONE<Leo> playfully bites her neck. 

THE_VOW_DVS126
00:13:07,00 --> 00:13:14,50
He tickles her sides and she sinks to the floor in the fetal position. 

THE_VOW_DVS127
00:13:15,00 --> 00:13:20,50
He eyes clay on a table. 

THE_VOW_DVS128
00:13:39,00 --> 00:13:45,50
Nodding, SOMEONE<Paige> gives him a tender smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS129
00:13:54,00 --> 00:13:59,50
She points at a different table. 

THE_VOW_DVS130
00:13:58,00 --> 00:14:03,50
She eyes the subject of his commentary. 

THE_VOW_DVS131
00:14:04,00 --> 00:14:11,50
Grinning, she cups his face in her hands and presses her lips to his abashed smirk. 

THE_VOW_DVS132
00:14:08,00 --> 00:14:15,50
As they kiss, she lies back on the floor, pulling him down on top of her. 

THE_VOW_DVS133
00:14:13,00 --> 00:14:18,50
He brushes his fingers over her hair, 

THE_VOW_DVS135
00:14:17,00 --> 00:14:23,50
then lowers his lips to her neck. 

THE_VOW_DVS136
00:14:20,00 --> 00:14:24,50
She pulls up his shirt to reveal his toned back, and works it over his head. 

THE_VOW_DVS139
00:14:26,00 --> 00:14:34,50
His fingers move to the buttons on her top. 

THE_VOW_DVS140
00:14:31,00 --> 00:14:37,50
Sunlight glows through the studio windows as SOMEONE<Paige> lies asleep face down on SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> chest. A rumpled sheet covers their waists. 

THE_VOW_DVS141
00:14:34,00 --> 00:14:40,50
SOMEONE<Leo> stirs and caresses his wife’s arm with his thumb. 

THE_VOW_DVS142
00:14:49,00 --> 00:14:56,50
In the present, SOMEONE<Paige> breaths with a nasal cannula as she lies in bed. 

THE_VOW_DVS143
00:14:53,00 --> 00:14:59,50
Wound scars barely show on the right side of her face. 

THE_VOW_DVS144
00:15:05,00 --> 00:15:11,50
SOMEONE<Leo> stands with SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> doctor at the foot of the bed. 

THE_VOW_DVS145
00:15:08,00 --> 00:15:15,50
The brunette shifts her groggy gaze, then closes her eyes and winces. 

THE_VOW_DVS146
00:15:12,00 --> 00:15:17,50
SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> eyes grow misty. 

THE_VOW_DVS147
00:15:32,00 --> 00:15:37,50
SOMEONE<Paige> gives him an uncertain look. 

THE_VOW_DVS148
00:15:36,00 --> 00:15:40,50
SOMEONE<Leo> turns to the doctor. 

THE_VOW_DVS149
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:49,50
SOMEONE<Paige> addresses the question to SOMEONE<Leo>. 

THE_VOW_DVS150
00:15:48,00 --> 00:15:53,50
He shoots her doctor a glance. 

THE_VOW_DVS151
00:15:50,00 --> 00:15:55,50
SOMEONE<Paige> eyes him expectantly. 

THE_VOW_DVS152
00:15:58,00 --> 00:16:05,50
The real doctor turns to SOMEONE<Leo> who returns a nonplussed glance. 

THE_VOW_DVS153
00:16:06,00 --> 00:16:14,50
The physician watches as SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> distressed husband takes a seat at his wife’s bedside. 

THE_VOW_DVS154
00:16:12,00 --> 00:16:19,50
SOMEONE<Paige> stares at SOMEONE<Leo> with perplexed eyes, and he meets her gaze solemnly. 

THE_VOW_DVS155
00:16:17,00 --> 00:16:21,50
She glances away. 

THE_VOW_DVS156
00:16:24,00 --> 00:16:30,50
He touches her arm, but she pulls it back with an alarmed look. 

THE_VOW_DVS157
00:16:28,00 --> 00:16:33,50
SOMEONE<Leo> drops his dejected gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS158
00:16:30,00 --> 00:16:35,50
The doctor observes closely. 

THE_VOW_DVS159
00:16:32,00 --> 00:16:39,50
SOMEONE<Paige> lifts her hand and stares at the gold rope designed wedding ring on her finger. 

THE_VOW_DVS160
00:16:36,00 --> 00:16:41,50
She shifts her shocked eyes to SOMEONE<Leo>. 

THE_VOW_DVS161
00:16:41,00 --> 00:16:45,50
Now he exits to the hall. 

THE_VOW_DVS162
00:17:03,00 --> 00:17:08,50
He storms off. 

THE_VOW_DVS163
00:17:05,00 --> 00:17:13,50
Now in a corridor, SOMEONE<Leo> paces by a vending machine, clenching and unclenching his fists. 

THE_VOW_DVS164
00:17:10,00 --> 00:17:14,50
He leans against the machine. 

THE_VOW_DVS165
00:17:17,00 --> 00:17:23,50
With his back against it, he sinks to the floor. 

THE_VOW_DVS166
00:17:27,00 --> 00:17:34,50
He touches the wedding band around his finger, then wrings his hands. 

THE_VOW_DVS168
00:17:32,00 --> 00:17:38,50
SOMEONE<Paige> enters a waiting room and finds SOMEONE<Leo> asleep on a couch. 

THE_VOW_DVS169
00:17:35,00 --> 00:17:40,50
She pokes his shoulder with one finger. 

THE_VOW_DVS170
00:17:40,00 --> 00:17:45,50
Waking, he hurriedly sits up and rubs his face. 

THE_VOW_DVS171
00:17:47,00 --> 00:17:52,50
She flashes a nervous grin. 

THE_VOW_DVS172
00:18:03,00 --> 00:18:08,50
Smiling he collects his belongings. 

THE_VOW_DVS173
00:18:07,00 --> 00:18:11,50
He takes her to the cafeteria. 

THE_VOW_DVS174
00:18:39,00 --> 00:18:43,50
SOMEONE<Paige> frowns dubiously. 

THE_VOW_DVS175
00:19:02,00 --> 00:19:06,50
SOMEONE<Paige> shifts her shocked gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS176
00:19:07,00 --> 00:19:14,50
She moves down the serving line. Now, SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> friends visit at the hospital. 

THE_VOW_DVS177
00:19:15,00 --> 00:19:20,50
A guy throws a packaged salad at another. 

THE_VOW_DVS179
00:19:42,00 --> 00:19:48,50
The girl with the beauty SOMEONE<mark> crouches in front of SOMEONE<Leo> and looks up at him. 

THE_VOW_DVS180
00:19:57,00 --> 00:20:01,50
SOMEONE<Leo> gazes downward. 

THE_VOW_DVS182
00:19:59,00 --> 00:20:07,50
he reclines in the large, industrial room, serving as his and SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> trendy Bohemian apartment. 

THE_VOW_DVS183
00:20:05,00 --> 00:20:13,50
Now, he arrives in the recovery ward with a tote bag and strides cheerfully to SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> curtained off bed. 

THE_VOW_DVS184
00:20:11,00 --> 00:20:15,50
Pulling the curtains aside, 

THE_VOW_DVS185
00:20:12,00 --> 00:20:18,50
he finds the bed crisply made and unoccupied. 

THE_VOW_DVS186
00:20:17,00 --> 00:20:21,50
He goes to the nurse’s station. 

THE_VOW_DVS187
00:20:32,00 --> 00:20:38,50
Leaving the recovery area, SOMEONE<Leo> breaks into a run. 

THE_VOW_DVS188
00:20:35,00 --> 00:20:40,50
Now in a comfortable private suite, 

THE_VOW_DVS189
00:20:47,00 --> 00:20:53,50
an elegant older couple regards SOMEONE<Leo> coldly. 

THE_VOW_DVS190
00:21:33,00 --> 00:21:37,50
SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> mother kisses her hand. 

THE_VOW_DVS191
00:22:15,00 --> 00:22:19,50
In the cafeteria. 

THE_VOW_DVS192
00:22:32,00 --> 00:22:37,50
SOMEONE<Leo> meets her gaze reluctantly. 

THE_VOW_DVS193
00:22:58,00 --> 00:23:02,50
SOMEONE<Leo> hangs his head. 

THE_VOW_DVS194
00:23:05,00 --> 00:23:10,50
SOMEONE<Paige> leaves the table and he gestures helplessly. 

THE_VOW_DVS195
00:23:09,00 --> 00:23:14,50
Standing he gathers their things. 

THE_VOW_DVS196
00:23:52,00 --> 00:23:57,50
SOMEONE<Paige> shrugs and shakes her head. 

THE_VOW_DVS197
00:23:55,00 --> 00:23:59,50
She moves off. 

THE_VOW_DVS198
00:23:56,00 --> 00:24:02,50
SOMEONE<Leo> briefly hangs his head then takes a deep breath. 

THE_VOW_DVS199
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:08,50
Now SOMEONE<Paige> enters the VIP recovery room, clad in a short crocheted sweater dress and boots. 

THE_VOW_DVS200
00:24:16,00 --> 00:24:21,50
Her doctor arrives. 

THE_VOW_DVS201
00:24:22,00 --> 00:24:27,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Leo> runs through the hospital. 

THE_VOW_DVS202
00:24:40,00 --> 00:24:44,50
SOMEONE<Leo> hurries in. 

THE_VOW_DVS203
00:25:09,00 --> 00:25:16,50
Her brow knitted, SOMEONE<Paige> blinks at SOMEONE<Leo>. He lowers the phone. 

THE_VOW_DVS204
00:25:45,00 --> 00:25:51,50
SOMEONE<Paige> stares at him, her gaze softening. 

THE_VOW_DVS205
00:25:59,00 --> 00:26:06,50
Lowering her thoughtful eyes, SOMEONE<Paige> puffs her cheeks out then exhales. 

THE_VOW_DVS206
00:26:08,00 --> 00:26:12,50
Her parents glower. 

THE_VOW_DVS207
00:26:24,00 --> 00:26:29,50
SOMEONE<Leo> fixes his fond eyes on his wife. 

THE_VOW_DVS208
00:26:27,00 --> 00:26:37,50
Now, as he drives her through the city, SOMEONE<Paige> faces her side view mirror. She briefly lifts her bangs back and studies the scar at her hairline. 

THE_VOW_DVS209
00:26:40,00 --> 00:26:48,50
Noting her husband’s earnest expression, SOMEONE<Paige> yields a shy smile. An elevated train passes nearby. 

THE_VOW_DVS210
00:26:48,00 --> 00:26:53,50
SOMEONE<Leo> smiles wistfully. 

THE_VOW_DVS211
00:27:06,00 --> 00:27:12,50
SOMEONE<Paige> averts her surprised, slack-jawed gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS212
00:27:09,00 --> 00:27:16,50
At night, SOMEONE<Leo> shuts her door for her as she gets out of his 80s era Wagoneer. 

THE_VOW_DVS213
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:19,50
He shyly walks her to their apartment’s entrance. 

THE_VOW_DVS214
00:27:21,00 --> 00:27:27,50
He leads her in to a foyer, then gestures. 

THE_VOW_DVS215
00:27:25,00 --> 00:27:33,50
As he shuts the door and carries their things, SOMEONE<Paige> wrings her hands and ventures warily into the living room. 

THE_VOW_DVS216
00:27:33,00 --> 00:27:40,50
SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> eyes widen. The girl with the beauty SOMEONE<mark> hugs her. 

THE_VOW_DVS217
00:27:50,00 --> 00:27:55,50
The lovely woman recovers her smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS218
00:27:56,00 --> 00:28:00,50
The wedding officiant. 

THE_VOW_DVS219
00:28:10,00 --> 00:28:17,50
As SOMEONE<Paige> hurries off, SOMEONE<Lily> watches her go. SOMEONE<Leo> follows his wife. 

THE_VOW_DVS220
00:28:14,00 --> 00:28:19,50
Later, the guests file out. 

THE_VOW_DVS221
00:28:20,00 --> 00:28:27,50
SOMEONE<Leo> sees off a trendy couple, then withdraws into the apartment and shuts the door. 

THE_VOW_DVS222
00:28:25,00 --> 00:28:33,50
At a dressing table, SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> fingers glide over a drawing of a reclined female figure in a sketchbook. 

THE_VOW_DVS223
00:28:31,00 --> 00:28:36,50
Quaint odds and ends litter the surface. 

THE_VOW_DVS224
00:28:33,00 --> 00:28:42,50
SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> reflections shows in a small round mirror trimmed along the bottom with photos and illustrations. 

THE_VOW_DVS225
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:45,50
She picks up a bottle of perfume, and gives it a sniff. 

THE_VOW_DVS226
00:28:43,00 --> 00:28:49,50
SOMEONE<Leo> approaches and sits in a nearby armchair. 

THE_VOW_DVS227
00:29:32,00 --> 00:29:37,50
Her gaze anguished, SOMEONE<Paige> shuts her eyes. 

THE_VOW_DVS228
00:29:47,00 --> 00:29:51,50
SOMEONE<Leo> gets up and leaves the room. 

THE_VOW_DVS230
00:29:50,00 --> 00:29:56,50
Staring ahead, SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> features twist in a remorseful SOMEONE<grimace>. 

THE_VOW_DVS231
00:29:54,00 --> 00:30:01,50
In the living room, a shirtless SOMEONE covers his bare feet with a nappy blanket 

THE_VOW_DVS232
00:29:58,00 --> 00:30:03,50
and curls up beneath it on a couch. 

THE_VOW_DVS233
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:05,50
SOMEONE<Paige> remains at the dressing table. 

THE_VOW_DVS234
00:30:04,00 --> 00:30:09,50
She props her chin on her fist. 

THE_VOW_DVS235
00:30:07,00 --> 00:30:14,50
An artfully made, queen sized bed lies unoccupied behind her. 

THE_VOW_DVS236
00:30:11,00 --> 00:30:17,50
On the couch, SOMEONE<Leo> stares off with a melancholy gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS237
00:30:14,00 --> 00:30:21,50
Now, the sun shines brightly outside their converted warehouse building. 

THE_VOW_DVS238
00:30:18,00 --> 00:30:27,50
Inside a framed photo of a shirtless SOMEONE<Leo> stands beside a baroque vanity mirror painted yellow. 

THE_VOW_DVS239
00:30:24,00 --> 00:30:33,50
The frame of a much larger wall mirror is home to several more candids, lovingly tucked in place. 

THE_VOW_DVS240
00:30:30,00 --> 00:30:36,50
SOMEONE<Paige> approaches in a towel and spies a photo of her tattooed back. 

THE_VOW_DVS241
00:30:35,00 --> 00:30:42,50
She anxiously locates the swirling crescent shaped fish tattoo on her actual back. 

THE_VOW_DVS242
00:30:45,00 --> 00:30:50,50
SOMEONE<Paige> steps away from the mirror. 

THE_VOW_DVS243
00:30:47,00 --> 00:30:53,50
On the living room couch, SOMEONE<Leo> stirs groggily and wakes. 

THE_VOW_DVS244
00:30:51,00 --> 00:30:55,50
He sits up and throws off the blanket. 

THE_VOW_DVS245
00:30:53,00 --> 00:30:58,50
He rests his elbows on his knees, 

THE_VOW_DVS246
00:30:55,00 --> 00:31:01,50
then stands and plods bare bottomed across the room. 

THE_VOW_DVS247
00:30:59,00 --> 00:31:06,50
As SOMEONE<Paige> puts on a bra, her naked husband straggles by, rubbing his eyes. 

THE_VOW_DVS248
00:31:15,00 --> 00:31:19,50
SOMEONE<Paige> cracks up. 

THE_VOW_DVS249
00:31:22,00 --> 00:31:28,50
Smiling, SOMEONE<Leo> shuts himself in an adjacent bathroom. 

THE_VOW_DVS250
00:31:26,00 --> 00:31:34,50
Now, a door opens to reveal SOMEONE<Paige> wearing a Chicago Cubs sweatshirt and a sporty ponytail. 

THE_VOW_DVS251
00:31:32,00 --> 00:31:36,50
She enters the kitchen. 

THE_VOW_DVS252
00:31:33,00 --> 00:31:38,50
Sitting at the island, SOMEONE<Leo> beams at her. 

THE_VOW_DVS253
00:31:46,00 --> 00:31:50,50
She opens a cabinet. 

THE_VOW_DVS254
00:31:53,00 --> 00:32:00,50
SOMEONE<Paige> continues through the kitchen, opening the high cabinets one at a time. 

THE_VOW_DVS255
00:31:57,00 --> 00:32:02,50
SOMEONE<Leo> watches her intently. 

THE_VOW_DVS256
00:31:59,00 --> 00:32:03,50
She notices. 

THE_VOW_DVS257
00:32:11,00 --> 00:32:17,50
SOMEONE<Paige> notices fresh fruit, coffee, and French toast on the island. 

THE_VOW_DVS258
00:32:25,00 --> 00:32:30,50
SOMEONE<Paige> sits at a place setting. 

THE_VOW_DVS259
00:32:32,00 --> 00:32:37,50
SOMEONE<Leo> nods and sets down a newspaper. 

THE_VOW_DVS260
00:32:40,00 --> 00:32:45,50
SOMEONE<Paige> shrugs inquisitively. 

THE_VOW_DVS261
00:32:47,00 --> 00:32:53,50
SOMEONE<Leo> bites his lip and stifles a boyish smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS262
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:55,50
SOMEONE<Paige> nods demurely. 

THE_VOW_DVS263
00:33:05,00 --> 00:33:11,50
As SOMEONE<Leo> gets the coffee pot his wife bites into a strip of bacon. 

THE_VOW_DVS264
00:33:13,00 --> 00:33:17,50
SOMEONE<Paige> stares at the bacon. 

THE_VOW_DVS265
00:33:15,00 --> 00:33:20,50
She sets it down and picks bacon bits off her tongue. 

THE_VOW_DVS266
00:34:05,00 --> 00:34:12,50
SOMEONE<Leo> steps toward his wife, hesitates, and pats her back. 

THE_VOW_DVS267
00:34:10,00 --> 00:34:14,50
He heads for the door. 

THE_VOW_DVS268
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:18,50
Going out, he glances at her repeatedly. 

THE_VOW_DVS269
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:22,50
SOMEONE<Paige> offers a small wave and he shuts the door. 

THE_VOW_DVS270
00:34:20,00 --> 00:34:26,50
Left alone, she bites into a strip of bacon. 

THE_VOW_DVS271
00:34:23,00 --> 00:34:32,50
Now SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> Wagoneer pulls up outside a converted garage with corrugated metal walls and a red door. 

THE_VOW_DVS272
00:34:29,00 --> 00:34:35,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Lily> works at a soundboard. 

THE_VOW_DVS273
00:34:32,00 --> 00:34:38,50
SOMEONE<Leo> comes in and deposits his things near the door. 

THE_VOW_DVS274
00:35:27,00 --> 00:35:32,50
SOMEONE<Leo> hangs his head unhappily. 

THE_VOW_DVS275
00:35:58,00 --> 00:36:07,50
At the apartment, SOMEONE<Paige> slides aside a grated door, protecting shelves of records, books, and DVDs. 

THE_VOW_DVS276
00:36:04,00 --> 00:36:13,50
She finds a sticky note from SOMEONE<Leo> attached to one disc’s box. It reads More Evidence. 

THE_VOW_DVS277
00:36:12,00 --> 00:36:16,50
She winces as she watches. 

THE_VOW_DVS278
00:36:28,00 --> 00:36:33,50
SOMEONE<Paige> laughs at her recorded comment. 

THE_VOW_DVS279
00:36:35,00 --> 00:36:40,50
In the video, SOMEONE<Paige> holds up her menu. 

THE_VOW_DVS280
00:37:01,00 --> 00:37:06,50
SOMEONE<Paige> sorrowfully covers her mouth. 

THE_VOW_DVS281
00:37:03,00 --> 00:37:10,50
Later, she clutches a hard-covered book to her chest, as she strides into SOMEONE<Café> Mnemonic. 

THE_VOW_DVS282
00:37:08,00 --> 00:37:15,50
Crouching in front of a display case, she eyes shelves of pastries, then straightens. 

THE_VOW_DVS283
00:37:21,00 --> 00:37:25,50
She points, 

THE_VOW_DVS284
00:37:30,00 --> 00:37:36,50
she grins. Now she exits with her purchase. 

THE_VOW_DVS285
00:37:36,00 --> 00:37:42,50
At a store across the street, SOMEONE<Leo> pays a florist. 

THE_VOW_DVS286
00:37:39,00 --> 00:37:48,50
Outside SOMEONE<Café> Mnemonic, SOMEONE<Paige> glances around without seeing him, then heads down a sidewalk. 

THE_VOW_DVS287
00:37:45,00 --> 00:37:51,50
SOMEONE<Leo> takes his bouquet of flowers and hurries in another direction. 

THE_VOW_DVS288
00:37:49,00 --> 00:37:57,50
Later, SOMEONE<Paige> stands by a stairway to an L-train platform and looks around in confusion. 

THE_VOW_DVS289
00:37:54,00 --> 00:37:59,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Leo> arrives at their apartment. 

THE_VOW_DVS290
00:37:59,00 --> 00:38:07,50
Elsewhere in the city, SOMEONE<Paige> stands at a bustling intersection and blinks her frustrated eyes. 

THE_VOW_DVS292
00:38:06,00 --> 00:38:12,50
At the apartment, SOMEONE<Leo> spots his wife’s cellphone left on the kitchen island. He picks it up and checks its display, 

THE_VOW_DVS293
00:38:09,00 --> 00:38:15,50
then heads outside. 

THE_VOW_DVS294
00:38:14,00 --> 00:38:19,50
On the sidewalk out front, he glances around, then breaks into a run. 

THE_VOW_DVS297
00:38:20,00 --> 00:38:26,50
SOMEONE<Paige> enters a restaurant equipment store and approaches a worker at a counter. 

THE_VOW_DVS298
00:38:28,00 --> 00:38:33,50
SOMEONE<Leo> continues his search. 

THE_VOW_DVS299
00:38:39,00 --> 00:38:45,50
Now a car pulls up in front of SOMEONE<Paige>. 

THE_VOW_DVS300
00:38:46,00 --> 00:38:50,50
Her mother beckons. 

THE_VOW_DVS301
00:38:48,00 --> 00:38:54,50
Climbing into the convertible Mercedes, SOMEONE<Paige> hugs her. 

THE_VOW_DVS302
00:38:53,00 --> 00:38:57,50
They drive off. 

THE_VOW_DVS303
00:38:54,00 --> 00:39:02,50
Later at the apartment, SOMEONE<Leo> waits in the living room area and anxiously rubs his head. 

THE_VOW_DVS304
00:38:59,00 --> 00:39:07,50
SOMEONE<Paige> arrives wearing a classy, contemporary dress and a half sleeved cardigan. 

THE_VOW_DVS306
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:09,50
SOMEONE<Leo> strides over. 

THE_VOW_DVS307
00:39:42,00 --> 00:39:46,50
SOMEONE<Paige> gives a helpless shrug. 

THE_VOW_DVS308
00:39:53,00 --> 00:39:59,50
SOMEONE<Leo> bows his head then meets her imploring gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS309
00:40:03,00 --> 00:40:08,50
SOMEONE<Leo> trudges out of the kitchen. 

THE_VOW_DVS310
00:40:12,00 --> 00:40:17,50
Later he drives her through an upscale neighborhood. 

THE_VOW_DVS311
00:40:23,00 --> 00:40:28,50
She holds the bouquet he purchased. 

THE_VOW_DVS312
00:40:36,00 --> 00:40:40,50
SOMEONE<Paige> blinks. 

THE_VOW_DVS313
00:40:39,00 --> 00:40:43,50
She mulls it over. 

THE_VOW_DVS314
00:40:43,00 --> 00:40:48,50
They approach a Tudor style house. 

THE_VOW_DVS315
00:40:59,00 --> 00:41:06,50
Now in a dining room, SOMEONE<Gwen> casually displays a ring on her finger. 

THE_VOW_DVS316
00:41:35,00 --> 00:41:41,50
SOMEONE<Leo> eyes SOMEONE<Paige> who mouths, It’s okay. 

THE_VOW_DVS317
00:41:40,00 --> 00:41:46,50
Already seated, SOMEONE<Leo> stands awkwardly, then sits again. 

THE_VOW_DVS318
00:42:07,00 --> 00:42:12,50
SOMEONE<Leo> raises his glass with the others. 

THE_VOW_DVS319
00:42:21,00 --> 00:42:26,50
SOMEONE<Bill> gives a wry look. 

THE_VOW_DVS320
00:42:24,00 --> 00:42:31,50
SOMEONE<Leo> eyes her lovingly, and she twitches an uneasy smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS321
00:42:43,00 --> 00:42:47,50
SOMEONE<Paige> nods equivocating. 

THE_VOW_DVS322
00:42:47,00 --> 00:42:51,50
SOMEONE<Gwen> gives her fiancé a look. 

THE_VOW_DVS323
00:43:30,00 --> 00:43:36,50
SOMEONE<Gwen> and SOMEONE<Paige> stare at him with blank expressions. 

THE_VOW_DVS324
00:43:34,00 --> 00:43:39,50
SOMEONE<Bill> gives a puzzled shrug. 

THE_VOW_DVS325
00:43:39,00 --> 00:43:45,50
Later, patrons queue up outside a chic bar. 

THE_VOW_DVS326
00:43:42,00 --> 00:43:48,50
Entering, SOMEONE<Leo> and SOMEONE<Ryan> trail behind SOMEONE<Gwen> and SOMEONE<Paige>. 

THE_VOW_DVS327
00:43:51,00 --> 00:43:57,50
SOMEONE<Paige> waves at a blonde, who averts her gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS328
00:43:56,00 --> 00:44:01,50
SOMEONE<Gwen> glances over. 

THE_VOW_DVS329
00:44:02,00 --> 00:44:06,50
They reach a table. 

THE_VOW_DVS330
00:44:05,00 --> 00:44:09,50
Three women greet them. 

THE_VOW_DVS331
00:44:08,00 --> 00:44:13,50
SOMEONE<Ryan> slaps SOMEONE<Leo> on the back. 

THE_VOW_DVS332
00:44:10,00 --> 00:44:15,50
SOMEONE<Leo> observes the group, tentatively. 

THE_VOW_DVS333
00:44:22,00 --> 00:44:27,50
Turning, SOMEONE<Paige> stares with an enamored look. 

THE_VOW_DVS334
00:44:27,00 --> 00:44:33,50
A clean-cut blonde man in a suit holds her gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS335
00:44:48,00 --> 00:44:53,50
SOMEONE<Jeremy> smirks. 

THE_VOW_DVS336
00:44:57,00 --> 00:45:04,50
SOMEONE<Paige> smiles at SOMEONE<Jeremy> who gives SOMEONE<Leo> a haughty glance on his way to the bar. 

THE_VOW_DVS337
00:45:14,00 --> 00:45:21,50
As the reunited friends chat, SOMEONE<Leo> stands awkwardly apart. 

THE_VOW_DVS338
00:45:18,00 --> 00:45:23,50
Later, at his recording studio. 

THE_VOW_DVS339
00:45:44,00 --> 00:45:49,50
SOMEONE<Lily> frowns dizzily. 

THE_VOW_DVS340
00:45:48,00 --> 00:45:52,50
Now they sit outside. 

THE_VOW_DVS341
00:46:07,00 --> 00:46:12,50
SOMEONE<Leo> glances over, then shrugs. 

THE_VOW_DVS342
00:46:30,00 --> 00:46:35,50
SOMEONE<Leo> stares off thoughtfully. 

THE_VOW_DVS343
00:46:33,00 --> 00:46:43,50
Now, an L-train trundles over a bridge. Riding on board, SOMEONE<Paige> glances out her window, as her train crosses an intersecting rail line. 

THE_VOW_DVS344
00:46:41,00 --> 00:46:49,50
Later, elevator doors open and she strides past a reception desk in an upscale office. 

THE_VOW_DVS345
00:46:52,00 --> 00:46:59,50
SOMEONE<Paige> finds SOMEONE<Jeremy> on the phone in his office. They swap a wave. 

THE_VOW_DVS346
00:47:02,00 --> 00:47:08,50
Facing his ex, he grins from ear to ear. 

THE_VOW_DVS347
00:47:08,00 --> 00:47:14,50
He gestures cordially, and SOMEONE<Paige> takes a seat in front of his desk. 

THE_VOW_DVS348
00:47:12,00 --> 00:47:17,50
Sitting behind it, he shoots her a quizzical look. 

THE_VOW_DVS349
00:47:36,00 --> 00:47:41,50
Wincing, SOMEONE<Paige> glances away. 

THE_VOW_DVS350
00:48:02,00 --> 00:48:06,50
He rises. 

THE_VOW_DVS351
00:48:14,00 --> 00:48:19,50
He half-sits on the front of his desk. 

THE_VOW_DVS352
00:48:32,00 --> 00:48:37,50
Averting her gaze, SOMEONE<Paige> nods disappointedly. 

THE_VOW_DVS353
00:48:55,00 --> 00:48:59,50
They both stand. 

THE_VOW_DVS354
00:48:56,00 --> 00:49:02,50
With a bashful smile, SOMEONE<Paige> hugs him. 

THE_VOW_DVS355
00:48:59,00 --> 00:49:06,50
He hesitates then wraps his arms around her and wraps his arms around her and rests this chin on her shoulder. 

THE_VOW_DVS356
00:49:03,00 --> 00:49:08,50
As they inch apart, SOMEONE<Paige> cradles the back of his head and they kiss. 

THE_VOW_DVS358
00:49:31,00 --> 00:49:37,50
Blinking back tears, she struggles to remain composed. 

THE_VOW_DVS359
00:49:36,00 --> 00:49:40,50
She bites her lip. 

THE_VOW_DVS361
00:49:40,00 --> 00:49:49,50
Later, at the apartment, she kneels on the dining table, adding photographs to rows of images organized in front of her. Other photos lie in disarray behind her.  

THE_VOW_DVS363
00:49:50,00 --> 00:49:54,50
SOMEONE<Leo> enters. 

THE_VOW_DVS364
00:49:59,00 --> 00:50:04,50
He kisses her cheek, which unsettles her. 

THE_VOW_DVS365
00:51:43,00 --> 00:51:49,50
As she rests her elbows on the table, he rubs her shoulders. 

THE_VOW_DVS366
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:52,50
He tickles her and she jumps. 

THE_VOW_DVS367
00:52:09,00 --> 00:52:14,50
He ducks into their bedroom. 

THE_VOW_DVS368
00:52:12,00 --> 00:52:17,50
She stares after him. 

THE_VOW_DVS369
00:52:14,00 --> 00:52:21,50
Standing just out of view by the doorway, SOMEONE<Leo> clenches a fist. SOMEONE<Paige> shifts her sad eyes, then turns away. 

THE_VOW_DVS372
00:52:21,00 --> 00:52:28,50
SOMEONE<Paige> pours herself coffee then walks to SOMEONE<Leo> who reads the paper. 

THE_VOW_DVS373
00:52:28,00 --> 00:52:32,50
She sits in front of him. 

THE_VOW_DVS374
00:52:36,00 --> 00:52:42,50
Smiling, he heads off. Outside they walk an alley. 

THE_VOW_DVS376
00:52:41,00 --> 00:52:58,50
Entering the studio, SOMEONE gazes around the spacious, rugged room, cluttered with works in progress and supplies. One bronzy 10-foot sculpture, shaped vaguely like a mermaid bears a pebbled texture. Sketches hang out of a few half-open drawers and a dresser 10 drawers high. 

THE_VOW_DVS377
00:52:58,00 --> 00:53:02,50
They explore the room. 

THE_VOW_DVS378
00:53:04,00 --> 00:53:09,50
SOMEONE<Paige> examines a treelike nymph sculpture. 

THE_VOW_DVS379
00:53:06,00 --> 00:53:11,50
Its trunk resembles a woman’s torso. 

THE_VOW_DVS380
00:53:29,00 --> 00:53:34,50
SOMEONE<Paige> gives a sad smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS381
00:53:36,00 --> 00:53:41,50
She edges past an industrial pedestal fan. 

THE_VOW_DVS382
00:53:45,00 --> 00:53:51,50
She wrings her hands, eying a feminine sculpture in repose. 

THE_VOW_DVS383
00:53:58,00 --> 00:54:03,50
He moves to her unfinished piece. 

THE_VOW_DVS384
00:54:02,00 --> 00:54:06,50
He offers a sculpting knife. 

THE_VOW_DVS385
00:54:10,00 --> 00:54:17,50
Standing at a partially-formed clay sculpture, SOMEONE<Paige> gives a tense look. 

THE_VOW_DVS386
00:54:23,00 --> 00:54:28,50
He bounces over to the stereo and turns it on. 

THE_VOW_DVS387
00:54:28,00 --> 00:54:33,50
He dances back to SOMEONE<Paige>. 

THE_VOW_DVS388
00:54:46,00 --> 00:54:52,50
As SOMEONE<Leo> trudges back to the stereo, SOMEONE<Paige> heaves a ponderous breath. 

THE_VOW_DVS389
00:54:52,00 --> 00:54:57,50
SOMEONE<Leo> slams down the sound system’s control deck. 

THE_VOW_DVS390
00:54:57,00 --> 00:55:02,50
SOMEONE<Paige> straightens and peers morosely at him. 

THE_VOW_DVS391
00:55:07,00 --> 00:55:13,50
She drops her admonished gaze. He shrugs. 

THE_VOW_DVS392
00:55:13,00 --> 00:55:19,50
With an exasperated look, he heads to the door. 

THE_VOW_DVS393
00:55:16,00 --> 00:55:21,50
SOMEONE watches him leave the studio, 

THE_VOW_DVS394
00:55:18,00 --> 00:55:25,50
then blinks her troubled eyes. She turns away from the unfinished sculpture. 

THE_VOW_DVS395
00:55:23,00 --> 00:55:31,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Leo> trudges down the alley. His hands curl tensely as they swing at his sides. 

THE_VOW_DVS397
00:55:30,00 --> 00:55:36,50
In the studio, SOMEONE eyes the section of wall covered in drawings and other artwork, 

THE_VOW_DVS398
00:55:34,00 --> 00:55:39,50
then faces her towering, treelike sculpture. 

THE_VOW_DVS399
00:55:37,00 --> 00:55:44,50
She eyes its twisted trunk with branches jutting out from the top, like hair on its head. 

THE_VOW_DVS400
00:55:42,00 --> 00:55:50,50
Lowering her gaze, she strides for the door and irritably tosses down a piece of clay on her way out. 

THE_VOW_DVS401
00:55:48,00 --> 00:55:54,50
Now, SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> Wagoneer rounds a corner by the apartment. 

THE_VOW_DVS402
00:55:56,00 --> 00:56:01,50
At home, SOMEONE<Paige> writes in a notebook. 

THE_VOW_DVS403
00:55:59,00 --> 00:56:03,50
She tears out a sheet. 

THE_VOW_DVS404
00:56:01,00 --> 00:56:06,50
She folds it hurriedly as SOMEONE<Leo> walks in. 

THE_VOW_DVS405
00:56:09,00 --> 00:56:16,50
SOMEONE<Leo> faces the bathroom. Seated at her desk, SOMEONE<Paige> stands nervously. 

THE_VOW_DVS406
00:56:16,00 --> 00:56:20,50
SOMEONE<Paige> goes to a bag on the bed. 

THE_VOW_DVS407
00:56:17,00 --> 00:56:22,50
Her father SOMEONE<Bill> exits the bathroom. 

THE_VOW_DVS408
00:56:42,00 --> 00:56:46,50
SOMEONE<Paige> continues packing. 

THE_VOW_DVS409
00:57:01,00 --> 00:57:06,50
SOMEONE<Bill> carries two bags out. 

THE_VOW_DVS410
00:57:03,00 --> 00:57:10,50
SOMEONE<Leo> puts down his shoulder satchel and regards SOMEONE<Paige> with a wounded expression. 

THE_VOW_DVS411
00:57:19,00 --> 00:57:26,50
SOMEONE<Leo> averts his considerate gaze, shakes his head and shifts on his feet. 

THE_VOW_DVS412
00:57:27,00 --> 00:57:33,50
SOMEONE<Paige> gives a relieved grin and nods. 

THE_VOW_DVS413
00:57:30,00 --> 00:57:35,50
Coming forward, she obliges warmly. 

THE_VOW_DVS414
00:57:32,00 --> 00:57:38,50
She steps back, smiles at SOMEONE<Leo> and leaves. 

THE_VOW_DVS415
00:57:35,00 --> 00:57:40,50
Her husband turns on the spot. 

THE_VOW_DVS416
00:57:37,00 --> 00:57:42,50
His jaw clenches, agonizing. 

THE_VOW_DVS417
00:57:41,00 --> 00:57:48,50
Now a penlight shines directly on SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> jade green eye. 

THE_VOW_DVS418
00:58:20,00 --> 00:58:24,50
She looks to SOMEONE<Paige>. 

THE_VOW_DVS419
00:58:24,00 --> 00:58:30,50
Her mom looks away worriedly then puts on a smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS420
00:58:28,00 --> 00:58:32,50
Her smile tenses. 

THE_VOW_DVS421
00:58:31,00 --> 00:58:37,50
She moves stiffly past SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> doctor and leaves the room. 

THE_VOW_DVS422
00:58:34,00 --> 00:58:39,50
Under the doctor’s compassionate smile, 

THE_VOW_DVS423
00:58:37,00 --> 00:58:41,50
the young woman briefly hangs her head. 

THE_VOW_DVS425
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:23,50
SOMEONE<Paige> takes a deep breath. 

THE_VOW_DVS426
00:59:29,00 --> 00:59:36,50
At the studio, SOMEONE<Leo> joins SOMEONE<Lily> as she works a recording session. 

THE_VOW_DVS427
00:59:35,00 --> 00:59:40,50
Teens play on the other side of the glass. 

THE_VOW_DVS428
00:59:55,00 --> 01:00:02,50
SOMEONE<Leo> wears a suit jacket and narrow tie worn over a crisp white shirt. 

THE_VOW_DVS429
01:00:17,00 --> 01:00:22,50
SOMEONE<Lily> flips a control board switch. 

THE_VOW_DVS430
01:00:42,00 --> 01:00:47,50
Lily’s gaze softens, sympathetically. 

THE_VOW_DVS431
01:00:44,00 --> 01:00:48,50
SOMEONE<Leo> marches out. 

THE_VOW_DVS433
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:55,50
Outside the Thornton’s mansion, elegant guests attend an engagement party in an immaculately tended back yard. 

THE_VOW_DVS434
01:00:57,00 --> 01:01:02,50
Passing SOMEONE<Gwen>, SOMEONE<Leo> happens upon SOMEONE<Ryan>. 

THE_VOW_DVS435
01:01:11,00 --> 01:01:16,50
Nearby, SOMEONE<Glen> glowers. 

THE_VOW_DVS436
01:01:58,00 --> 01:02:03,50
As he leaves, SOMEONE<Glen> smiles at SOMEONE<Leo>. 

THE_VOW_DVS437
01:02:02,00 --> 01:02:07,50
He smirks cryptically. 

THE_VOW_DVS438
01:02:04,00 --> 01:02:10,50
As he steps away, SOMEONE<Gwen> beams after him. 

THE_VOW_DVS439
01:02:07,00 --> 01:02:13,50
Now, SOMEONE<Leo> strolls the patio, sipping a glass of red wine. 

THE_VOW_DVS440
01:02:11,00 --> 01:02:15,50
He turns. 

THE_VOW_DVS441
01:02:12,00 --> 01:02:17,50
Her styled hair has highlights. 

THE_VOW_DVS442
01:02:16,00 --> 01:02:21,50
He stares at her groomed and lightened tresses. 

THE_VOW_DVS443
01:03:37,00 --> 01:03:44,50
Behind SOMEONE<Leo>, SOMEONE<Jeremy> and a blonde woman converse with SOMEONE<Bill> Thornton. 

THE_VOW_DVS444
01:04:01,00 --> 01:04:09,50
Now, at home, SOMEONE<Leo> puts on a dark blazer over a muted blue button down, then picks up a tie. 

THE_VOW_DVS445
01:04:07,00 --> 01:04:13,50
Later, he walks a demurely dressed SOMEONE<Paige> to his Wagoneer. 

THE_VOW_DVS446
01:04:37,00 --> 01:04:43,50
SOMEONE<Paige> chuckles as he strides briskly around the car. 

THE_VOW_DVS447
01:04:40,00 --> 01:04:49,50
Later, under gleaming skyscraper windows, the SUV pulls into a space in a deserted civic parking lot 

THE_VOW_DVS448
01:04:46,00 --> 01:04:51,50
situated before a crosswalk. 

THE_VOW_DVS449
01:04:48,00 --> 01:04:54,50
SOMEONE<Paige> smiles at SOMEONE<Leo>, then looks around uncertainly. 

THE_VOW_DVS450
01:04:52,00 --> 01:04:57,50
Her husband regards her with a tender gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS451
01:05:17,00 --> 01:05:23,50
SOMEONE<Paige> responds with a warm appreciative smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS452
01:05:21,00 --> 01:05:30,50
Now at SOMEONE<Café> Mnemonic, the front window shows SOMEONE<Leo> and SOMEONE<Paige> enjoying a meal and wine at a table for two. 

THE_VOW_DVS453
01:05:37,00 --> 01:05:41,50
He presents chocolates. 

THE_VOW_DVS454
01:05:47,00 --> 01:05:51,50
She smirks inquisitively. 

THE_VOW_DVS455
01:05:53,00 --> 01:05:59,50
She selects a chocolate, then pops it in her mouth. 

THE_VOW_DVS456
01:05:58,00 --> 01:06:02,50
She frowns. 

THE_VOW_DVS457
01:06:04,00 --> 01:06:11,50
As SOMEONE<Paige> chews the second truffle her eyes light up with a surprised smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS458
01:06:13,00 --> 01:06:18,50
She turns the box of chocolates to face SOMEONE<Leo>. 

THE_VOW_DVS459
01:06:17,00 --> 01:06:22,50
SOMEONE<Leo> eats one, SOMEONE<Paige> pops another in her mouth. 

THE_VOW_DVS460
01:06:22,00 --> 01:06:27,50
SOMEONE<Leo> takes a deep breath, then tries another. 

THE_VOW_DVS461
01:06:24,00 --> 01:06:29,50
SOMEONE<Paige> skeptically chews another truffle. 

THE_VOW_DVS462
01:06:35,00 --> 01:06:41,50
A fleck of truffle filling drops from her mouth onto her hair. 

THE_VOW_DVS463
01:06:38,00 --> 01:06:42,50
They both crack up. 

THE_VOW_DVS464
01:06:42,00 --> 01:06:48,50
SOMEONE<Leo> reaches for the fleck. SOMEONE<Paige> rocks in her seat. 

THE_VOW_DVS465
01:06:45,00 --> 01:06:50,50
Later, in the night air, 

THE_VOW_DVS466
01:06:47,00 --> 01:06:54,50
SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> SUV halts on a narrow lane in a quaintly lit public park. 

THE_VOW_DVS467
01:06:51,00 --> 01:06:57,50
He smiles at SOMEONE<Paige> and directs her gaze out the windshield. 

THE_VOW_DVS468
01:07:02,00 --> 01:07:08,50
SOMEONE<Leo> unbuttons his shirt and SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> smile fades. 

THE_VOW_DVS469
01:07:15,00 --> 01:07:20,50
He removes his shirt. 

THE_VOW_DVS470
01:07:37,00 --> 01:07:44,50
He sets a small wetsuit beside her and regards her with a subdued, wily smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS471
01:07:42,00 --> 01:07:46,50
SOMEONE<Paige> frowns, intrigued. 

THE_VOW_DVS472
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:58,50
SOMEONE<Paige> unbuckles her safety belt, then writhes in her seat, working her demure dress off over her head. 

THE_VOW_DVS473
01:07:56,00 --> 01:08:00,50
SOMEONE<Leo> takes a peek. 

THE_VOW_DVS475
01:07:59,00 --> 01:08:04,50
SOMEONE<Paige> shakes her hair out. 

THE_VOW_DVS476
01:08:02,00 --> 01:08:06,50
SOMEONE<Leo> turns. 

THE_VOW_DVS477
01:08:06,00 --> 01:08:16,50
He laughs as she dashes out in her bra and panties. Grabbing blankets and towels he hustles after her and does high steps to get out of his jeans. 

THE_VOW_DVS478
01:08:13,00 --> 01:08:20,50
SOMEONE<Paige> runs into the water up to her ankles and bids a hasty retreat. 

THE_VOW_DVS479
01:08:19,00 --> 01:08:26,50
Clad in biker briefs, SOMEONE<Leo> grabs her around the waist and carries her back in. 

THE_VOW_DVS480
01:08:23,00 --> 01:08:29,50
Joining hands they run further out into the glistening lake. 

THE_VOW_DVS481
01:08:27,00 --> 01:08:33,50
SOMEONE<Leo> plunges in and SOMEONE<Paige> submerges up to her shoulders. 

THE_VOW_DVS482
01:08:30,00 --> 01:08:37,50
SOMEONE<Leo> lifts both her feet and her upper body dunks up to her chin. 

THE_VOW_DVS483
01:08:34,00 --> 01:08:40,50
Now he helps SOMEONE<Paige> up and gives her a piggyback ride ashore. 

THE_VOW_DVS484
01:08:38,00 --> 01:08:43,50
Grabbing a towel and blanket, he wraps both around her. 

THE_VOW_DVS485
01:08:47,00 --> 01:08:52,50
SOMEONE<Paige> hurries back into his car and he follows. 

THE_VOW_DVS486
01:08:53,00 --> 01:09:00,50
SOMEONE<Leo> wraps a blanket around his shivering shoulders and laughs with SOMEONE<Paige>. 

THE_VOW_DVS487
01:09:04,00 --> 01:09:10,50
SOMEONE<Leo> considers, then envelops her hands in both his own. 

THE_VOW_DVS488
01:09:08,00 --> 01:09:13,50
He blows on her fingers then kisses them tenderly. 

THE_VOW_DVS490
01:09:12,00 --> 01:09:20,50
Now at the apartment, keys slide along the dining table. At its far end, SOMEONE<Leo> and SOMEONE<Paige> sway in an embrace. 

THE_VOW_DVS491
01:09:24,00 --> 01:09:28,50
SOMEONE<Leo> smiles fondly. 

THE_VOW_DVS492
01:09:27,00 --> 01:09:32,50
In the soft light of the streetlamps outside, he plants two tender kisses on her lips. 

THE_VOW_DVS494
01:09:41,00 --> 01:09:49,50
Leaning close, she brushes SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> blanket off his shoulders, while letting her own fall to the floor. 

THE_VOW_DVS495
01:09:46,00 --> 01:09:51,50
Standing in their underwear, they kiss again. 

THE_VOW_DVS496
01:09:55,00 --> 01:10:01,50
SOMEONE<Paige> smiles up at him sweetly, and his parted lips find hers. 

THE_VOW_DVS497
01:09:59,00 --> 01:10:05,50
The young woman wraps an arm around her husband’s bare shoulder 

THE_VOW_DVS498
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:07,50
and he cradles her head in his hand. 

THE_VOW_DVS499
01:10:04,00 --> 01:10:10,50
SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> hand finds his cheek and caresses it softly. 

THE_VOW_DVS500
01:10:07,00 --> 01:10:14,50
As they make out, we look on from the far end of the table. 

THE_VOW_DVS501
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:16,50
Our view sinks into the shadows. 

THE_VOW_DVS502
01:10:13,00 --> 01:10:18,50
Now, SOMEONE<Leo> helps SOMEONE<Paige> out of his car. 

THE_VOW_DVS503
01:10:21,00 --> 01:10:26,50
SOMEONE heads toward her parents' house. 

THE_VOW_DVS504
01:10:26,00 --> 01:10:30,50
She faces him. 

THE_VOW_DVS506
01:10:31,00 --> 01:10:37,50
Her smile gone, SOMEONE<Paige> shifts her uneasy gaze. SOMEONE<Leo> shakes his head earnestly. 

THE_VOW_DVS507
01:10:36,00 --> 01:10:41,50
SOMEONE<Paige> hunches her shoulders and looks away. 

THE_VOW_DVS508
01:10:40,00 --> 01:10:45,50
She meets his gaze with a gentle smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS509
01:10:53,00 --> 01:11:01,50
SOMEONE<Leo> lingers on the spot, shifting boyishly on his feet as his wife enters her parents’ home. 

THE_VOW_DVS510
01:10:58,00 --> 01:11:05,50
As she shuts the door, he turns away and steps around his car. 

THE_VOW_DVS511
01:11:05,00 --> 01:11:12,50
Inside the house, SOMEONE<Paige> sets down her keys and takes off her shoes. 

THE_VOW_DVS512
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:14,50
In the next room, SOMEONE<Gwen> waits up seated with a book. 

THE_VOW_DVS513
01:11:26,00 --> 01:11:31,50
SOMEONE<Paige> smiles sadly, her eyes welling up. 

THE_VOW_DVS514
01:11:36,00 --> 01:11:41,50
SOMEONE<Paige> shakes her head tearfully. 

THE_VOW_DVS515
01:11:52,00 --> 01:11:57,50
SOMEONE<Gwen> gives her a hug. 

THE_VOW_DVS516
01:11:58,00 --> 01:12:03,50
On a sunny day, SOMEONE<Leo> walks with his friends. 

THE_VOW_DVS517
01:12:38,00 --> 01:12:42,50
At the Thornton’s. 

THE_VOW_DVS518
01:12:48,00 --> 01:12:52,50
SOMEONE<Bill> brings SOMEONE<Paige> a folder. 

THE_VOW_DVS519
01:13:11,00 --> 01:13:15,50
SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> mother joins them. 

THE_VOW_DVS520
01:13:17,00 --> 01:13:22,50
SOMEONE<Bill> hands the file to his daughter. 

THE_VOW_DVS522
01:13:29,00 --> 01:13:35,50
At dusk in the city, two elevated trains pass one another under the Chicago skyline. 

THE_VOW_DVS523
01:13:33,00 --> 01:13:41,50
In the apartment, SOMEONE<Leo> drops a jacket on a chair and carries a stack of mail to a coffee table. 

THE_VOW_DVS524
01:13:38,00 --> 01:13:44,50
Sitting, he flips through the envelopes. 

THE_VOW_DVS525
01:13:41,00 --> 01:13:46,50
He pauses, then tosses them down. 

THE_VOW_DVS527
01:13:44,00 --> 01:13:50,50
a pink envelope bears a stamp reading Past Due. 

THE_VOW_DVS528
01:13:48,00 --> 01:13:54,50
SOMEONE<Leo> wearily leans back on the sofa and stares at the ceiling. 

THE_VOW_DVS529
01:13:52,00 --> 01:13:56,50
Now, on a sunny day, 

THE_VOW_DVS530
01:13:53,00 --> 01:14:01,50
yellow rose petals arc through the air as wedding guests shower them on SOMEONE<Ryan> and SOMEONE<Gwen>. 

THE_VOW_DVS531
01:13:58,00 --> 01:14:03,50
In their tux and gown, 

THE_VOW_DVS532
01:14:00,00 --> 01:14:07,50
the newlyweds joyfully make their way up a narrow aisle between the well-wishers. 

THE_VOW_DVS533
01:14:04,00 --> 01:14:10,50
Later, the groom sweeps his bride up in his arms. 

THE_VOW_DVS534
01:14:08,00 --> 01:14:13,50
She laughs delightedly and he kisses her cheek. 

THE_VOW_DVS535
01:14:11,00 --> 01:14:19,50
Later still, SOMEONE<Leo> steps toward SOMEONE<Paige>, but then holds back as she joins her sister for a wedding photo. 

THE_VOW_DVS537
01:14:17,00 --> 01:14:24,50
the photographer takes a picture of the sisters, their parents, and SOMEONE<Ryan>. 

THE_VOW_DVS538
01:14:22,00 --> 01:14:28,50
The bridal party moves on without SOMEONE<Leo>, who stands among the guests. 

THE_VOW_DVS539
01:14:26,00 --> 01:14:31,50
He turns on the spot, watching SOMEONE<Paige>. 

THE_VOW_DVS540
01:14:28,00 --> 01:14:33,50
She smiles briefly at him, then turns away. 

THE_VOW_DVS541
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:36,50
SOMEONE<Leo> moves unhappily through the crowd. 

THE_VOW_DVS542
01:14:33,00 --> 01:14:38,50
Later, with his necktie loosened, 

THE_VOW_DVS543
01:14:35,00 --> 01:14:41,50
he strolls through a lavish outdoor reception 

THE_VOW_DVS544
01:14:38,00 --> 01:14:43,50
and spies SOMEONE<Paige> dancing with her sister. 

THE_VOW_DVS545
01:14:44,00 --> 01:14:50,50
She fails to notice him and he moves on sullenly. 

THE_VOW_DVS546
01:14:47,00 --> 01:14:56,50
Reaching the edge of the party, he arrives at a crenelated terrace, overlooking the city’s distant gleaming skyline. 

THE_VOW_DVS547
01:14:53,00 --> 01:14:58,50
As he gazes off morosely, 

THE_VOW_DVS548
01:14:55,00 --> 01:15:01,50
SOMEONE<Bill> approaches with a bottle of fine liquor. 

THE_VOW_DVS549
01:15:06,00 --> 01:15:11,50
He sets two glasses on the parapet. 

THE_VOW_DVS550
01:15:10,00 --> 01:15:14,50
SOMEONE<Bill> pours the drinks. 

THE_VOW_DVS551
01:15:21,00 --> 01:15:25,50
They clink glasses. 

THE_VOW_DVS552
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:28,50
The two men sip the amber liquor. 

THE_VOW_DVS553
01:15:25,00 --> 01:15:30,50
SOMEONE<Leo> cocks his head and nods appreciatively. 

THE_VOW_DVS554
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:36,50
SOMEONE<Leo> puts down his glass, SOMEONE<Bill> does the same. 

THE_VOW_DVS555
01:15:59,00 --> 01:16:03,50
SOMEONE<Bill> takes another sip. 

THE_VOW_DVS556
01:16:05,00 --> 01:16:10,50
The young man turns away. 

THE_VOW_DVS557
01:16:34,00 --> 01:16:38,50
SOMEONE<Bill> stares at him. 

THE_VOW_DVS558
01:16:35,00 --> 01:16:41,50
From the reception, Mrs. Thornton notices the exchange. 

THE_VOW_DVS559
01:16:40,00 --> 01:16:46,50
Moving past him, SOMEONE<Leo> leaves the terrace. 

THE_VOW_DVS560
01:16:43,00 --> 01:16:49,50
The older man hesitantly takes a drink of his whiskey. 

THE_VOW_DVS561
01:16:46,00 --> 01:16:51,50
Behind him, SOMEONE<Leo> goes inside. 

THE_VOW_DVS562
01:16:48,00 --> 01:16:55,50
Setting his drink on a coaster, he plunks onto an elegant leather sofa. 

THE_VOW_DVS563
01:16:53,00 --> 01:16:59,50
SOMEONE<Jeremy> approaches, finishing off his own drink. 

THE_VOW_DVS564
01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:42,50
They stand toe to toe. 

THE_VOW_DVS565
01:17:55,00 --> 01:18:01,50
SOMEONE<Leo> swallows and vaguely flashes a smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS567
01:18:18,00 --> 01:18:23,50
SOMEONE<Leo> finds SOMEONE<Paige> staring at him, stunned. 

THE_VOW_DVS568
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:25,50
She marches off. 

THE_VOW_DVS569
01:18:22,00 --> 01:18:30,50
SOMEONE<Leo> looks down at SOMEONE<Jeremy>, who sprawls on the floor with a bleeding nose, then follows SOMEONE<Paige> outside. 

THE_VOW_DVS570
01:18:51,00 --> 01:18:55,50
SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> eyes glisten. 

THE_VOW_DVS571
01:19:31,00 --> 01:19:36,50
SOMEONE<Paige> wears a bitter, tearful smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS572
01:19:48,00 --> 01:19:55,50
Blinking back tears, SOMEONE<Leo> bravely meets her forgiving gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS573
01:19:53,00 --> 01:19:57,50
He grows stoic. 

THE_VOW_DVS574
01:20:01,00 --> 01:20:06,50
SOMEONE<Paige> averts her regretful gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS575
01:20:04,00 --> 01:20:10,50
Bowing his head, SOMEONE<Leo> shuffles back a few steps, then heads inside. 

THE_VOW_DVS576
01:20:08,00 --> 01:20:12,50
SOMEONE<Paige> helplessly turns on the spot. 

THE_VOW_DVS577
01:20:13,00 --> 01:20:18,50
Pausing by the door he faces his wife. 

THE_VOW_DVS578
01:20:27,00 --> 01:20:34,50
SOMEONE<Leo> regards her longingly, then turns away and walks back inside. 

THE_VOW_DVS579
01:20:31,00 --> 01:20:40,50
SOMEONE<Paige> stares after her estranged husband, then takes a few deep steadying breaths and shuts her eyes. 

THE_VOW_DVS580
01:20:37,00 --> 01:20:45,50
Back in the city, SOMEONE<Leo> lumbers down a sidewalk parallel to elevated train tracks. 

THE_VOW_DVS581
01:20:42,00 --> 01:20:49,50
His suit jacket dangling from one hand, and his tie hanging from the other. 

THE_VOW_DVS582
01:20:46,00 --> 01:20:53,50
His head droops forward and he transfers his coat to his other hand. 

THE_VOW_DVS583
01:20:53,00 --> 01:21:00,50
Now in his recording studio, SOMEONE<Leo> sits playing an acoustic guitar. 

THE_VOW_DVS584
01:20:57,00 --> 01:21:06,50
The view drifts past stacked equipment and microphone stands as we watch the heartbroken young man play. 

THE_VOW_DVS585
01:21:04,00 --> 01:21:10,50
On the other side of the glass, two lamps turn on in the mixing room. 

THE_VOW_DVS586
01:21:08,00 --> 01:21:14,50
SOMEONE<Lily> walks into view casually and peers at the soundboard. 

THE_VOW_DVS587
01:21:11,00 --> 01:21:18,50
In the recording room SOMEONE<Leo> gently plucks the guitar strings. 

THE_VOW_DVS588
01:21:15,00 --> 01:21:20,50
His lips hold a pensive frown. 

THE_VOW_DVS589
01:21:20,00 --> 01:21:27,50
From the other side of the glass, SOMEONE<Lily> stares at him, then leaves the room. 

THE_VOW_DVS590
01:21:25,00 --> 01:21:31,50
Unnoticing, SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> eyes remain on the instrument in his hands. 

THE_VOW_DVS591
01:21:29,00 --> 01:21:36,50
His wedding ring gleams on his finger as his left hand sets up cords on the fret board. 

THE_VOW_DVS592
01:21:33,00 --> 01:21:39,50
SOMEONE<Lily> walks up to him with folded arms. 

THE_VOW_DVS593
01:22:54,00 --> 01:23:00,50
SOMEONE<Lily> gives a tearful sympathetic nod. 

THE_VOW_DVS594
01:23:06,00 --> 01:23:12,50
SOMEONE<Leo> stares off, tears welling in his deep set eyes. 

THE_VOW_DVS595
01:23:13,00 --> 01:23:19,50
He wipes one away, sets his guitar down and faces his friend. 

THE_VOW_DVS596
01:23:18,00 --> 01:23:24,50
With a knowing shake of his head, he leaves his sorrowful friend stunned. 

THE_VOW_DVS597
01:23:23,00 --> 01:23:32,50
Out in the night, a gliding view of Chicago’s streets and high rises presents a vast expanse of speckled lights. 

THE_VOW_DVS598
01:23:29,00 --> 01:23:34,50
In SOMEONE’s now cleaned out studio, 

THE_VOW_DVS599
01:23:31,00 --> 01:23:36,50
SOMEONE<Leo> finishes packing a box. 

THE_VOW_DVS600
01:23:34,00 --> 01:23:39,50
A half dozen empty worktables fill the room. 

THE_VOW_DVS601
01:23:37,00 --> 01:23:42,50
SOMEONE<Leo> closes the box and carries it out. 

THE_VOW_DVS602
01:23:39,00 --> 01:23:45,50
Passing a trio of tall gracefully curved sculptures. 

THE_VOW_DVS603
01:23:43,00 --> 01:23:52,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Leo> loads the box on top of another in the back of his Wagoneer, then shuts the rear gate. 

THE_VOW_DVS604
01:23:49,00 --> 01:23:53,50
As he goes back inside, 

THE_VOW_DVS605
01:23:51,00 --> 01:23:56,50
a few pots of leggy dying flowers come into view. 

THE_VOW_DVS606
01:23:54,00 --> 01:24:01,50
The plank mounded with SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> clay scraps sits discarded beside them. 

THE_VOW_DVS607
01:23:59,00 --> 01:24:06,50
Now the bean shaped  cloud gate in Millennium Park reflects an overcast day. 

THE_VOW_DVS608
01:24:04,00 --> 01:24:08,50
Inside a high-rise building, 

THE_VOW_DVS609
01:24:05,00 --> 01:24:12,50
a woman at a conference table slides legal documents to SOMEONE<Leo>. 

THE_VOW_DVS610
01:24:11,00 --> 01:24:20,50
Next to a notary’s embossed stamp, he locates SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> signature on a line labeled Plaintiff. 

THE_VOW_DVS611
01:24:17,00 --> 01:24:24,50
Above a phrase reads, Joint Petition for Simplified Dissolution of Marriage. 

THE_VOW_DVS612
01:24:22,00 --> 01:24:29,50
SOMEONE<Leo> glances at the lawyer and signs his name on a line marked Defendant. 

THE_VOW_DVS613
01:24:26,00 --> 01:24:32,50
He twists the pen shut, drops it and leaves the table. 

THE_VOW_DVS614
01:24:30,00 --> 01:24:35,50
Now shirtless on a cloudy day, 

THE_VOW_DVS615
01:24:32,00 --> 01:24:38,50
the broad chested young man takes the garbage out 

THE_VOW_DVS616
01:24:35,00 --> 01:24:40,50
and finds the stray cat perched on the trash bin. 

THE_VOW_DVS617
01:24:38,00 --> 01:24:44,50
Munching a slice of pizza, he offers some to the cat. 

THE_VOW_DVS618
01:24:45,00 --> 01:24:51,50
The feline shows no interest in the food, but lets SOMEONE<Leo> pick him up. 

THE_VOW_DVS619
01:24:50,00 --> 01:24:57,50
The cat’s paws rest on SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> shoulder, as he carries the animal inside. 

THE_VOW_DVS620
01:24:56,00 --> 01:25:02,50
Now SOMEONE spots SOMEONE at a market and quickly turns tail. 

THE_VOW_DVS621
01:25:00,00 --> 01:25:05,50
SOMEONE<Paige> grins at the apprehensive woman. 

THE_VOW_DVS622
01:25:29,00 --> 01:25:34,50
SOMEONE's<Diane’s> words sink in hard. 

THE_VOW_DVS623
01:25:46,00 --> 01:25:50,50
SOMEONE<Gwen> approaches. 

THE_VOW_DVS624
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:57,50
She sees SOMEONE<Diane> hurrying out the door. 

THE_VOW_DVS625
01:25:54,00 --> 01:26:00,50
With a reluctant look, she faces her sister and meets her gaze. 

THE_VOW_DVS626
01:25:58,00 --> 01:26:02,50
SOMEONE<Gwen> shrugs her hands. 

THE_VOW_DVS627
01:26:04,00 --> 01:26:08,50
SOMEONE<Gwen> nods. 

THE_VOW_DVS628
01:26:12,00 --> 01:26:16,50
SOMEONE<Paige> rushes away. 

THE_VOW_DVS629
01:26:14,00 --> 01:26:20,50
Now SOMEONE<Paige> finds her mother gardening in front of the house. 

THE_VOW_DVS630
01:26:23,00 --> 01:26:28,50
SOMEONE<Paige> shoves down her bicycle. 

THE_VOW_DVS631
01:26:28,00 --> 01:26:32,50
Her mother bows her head. 

THE_VOW_DVS632
01:27:14,00 --> 01:27:20,50
Shaking her head, her mother lowers her tearful eyes. 

THE_VOW_DVS633
01:27:37,00 --> 01:27:41,50
Smiling, she wipes away tears. 

THE_VOW_DVS634
01:28:27,00 --> 01:28:31,50
SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> eyes brim with tears. 

THE_VOW_DVS635
01:28:32,00 --> 01:28:37,50
SOMEONE<Paige> slouches and shakes her head to herself. 

THE_VOW_DVS636
01:28:35,00 --> 01:28:39,50
She shrugs. 

THE_VOW_DVS637
01:28:46,00 --> 01:28:50,50
Glaring, she walks away. 

THE_VOW_DVS638
01:28:48,00 --> 01:28:54,50
Her mother remains kneeling before the autumn flowerbed. 

THE_VOW_DVS639
01:28:52,00 --> 01:28:58,50
Now in the city, a water taxi glides under a bridge. 

THE_VOW_DVS640
01:28:56,00 --> 01:29:02,50
SOMEONE<Leo> and a young woman follow the sidewalk in front of his apartment building. 

THE_VOW_DVS641
01:29:05,00 --> 01:29:11,50
As they stroll into the alley, SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> grin fades. 

THE_VOW_DVS642
01:29:09,00 --> 01:29:17,50
His ex-wife sits on a stoop with her head rested on her hands. She awkwardly gets to her feet. 

THE_VOW_DVS643
01:29:19,00 --> 01:29:24,50
Closing her eyes for a moment, SOMEONE<Paige> winces. 

THE_VOW_DVS644
01:29:28,00 --> 01:29:35,50
SOMEONE<Leo> watches his female friend leave, then faces SOMEONE<Paige>. 

THE_VOW_DVS645
01:29:33,00 --> 01:29:37,50
He steps closer. 

THE_VOW_DVS646
01:29:36,00 --> 01:29:40,50
SOMEONE<Paige> glances aside. 

THE_VOW_DVS647
01:29:55,00 --> 01:30:00,50
She sits back down on the stoop. 

THE_VOW_DVS648
01:30:01,00 --> 01:30:06,50
SOMEONE<Leo> takes a seat beside her. 

THE_VOW_DVS649
01:30:28,00 --> 01:30:34,50
SOMEONE<Paige> studies him, her expression growing tender. 

THE_VOW_DVS650
01:30:31,00 --> 01:30:38,50
As SOMEONE<Leo> regards her, she sucks in a breath and gazes off thoughtfully. 

THE_VOW_DVS651
01:30:36,00 --> 01:30:42,50
SOMEONE<Paige> shakes her head and drops her face in her hands. 

THE_VOW_DVS652
01:30:40,00 --> 01:30:44,50
Folding them she stares off. 

THE_VOW_DVS653
01:30:48,00 --> 01:30:53,50
Meeting SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> gaze, she shrugs. 

THE_VOW_DVS654
01:30:53,00 --> 01:30:58,50
He returns a gentle look and she considers him. 

THE_VOW_DVS655
01:30:56,00 --> 01:31:00,50
Now at North Western Law, 

THE_VOW_DVS656
01:30:58,00 --> 01:31:03,50
SOMEONE<Paige> sits in a lecture classroom with her notebook open. 

THE_VOW_DVS657
01:31:09,00 --> 01:31:16,50
As the other students around her diligently take notes and type on laptops, 

THE_VOW_DVS658
01:31:14,00 --> 01:31:18,50
SOMEONE draws in her notebook, 

THE_VOW_DVS659
01:31:16,00 --> 01:31:23,50
making sketches that resemble the treelike sculptures in her former studio. 

THE_VOW_DVS660
01:31:20,00 --> 01:31:28,50
Later, at a water taxi stop on the river, she walks with SOMEONE<Jeremy> up a flight of stairs. 

THE_VOW_DVS661
01:32:31,00 --> 01:32:36,50
SOMEONE<Jeremy> glances away. 

THE_VOW_DVS662
01:32:41,00 --> 01:32:46,50
She gazes at him with an apologetic look. 

THE_VOW_DVS663
01:32:44,00 --> 01:32:48,50
He forces a smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS664
01:32:46,00 --> 01:32:53,50
As they head up to the street, she takes his arm in a friendly gesture. 

THE_VOW_DVS665
01:32:50,00 --> 01:32:58,50
Now SOMEONE<Paige> sits on a bench on the law school’s quad and stares into the distance. 

THE_VOW_DVS666
01:32:55,00 --> 01:33:00,50
Her father approaches. 

THE_VOW_DVS667
01:33:14,00 --> 01:33:18,50
He takes a seat beside her. 

THE_VOW_DVS668
01:33:26,00 --> 01:33:31,50
SOMEONE’s<Bill’s> smile fades. 

THE_VOW_DVS669
01:33:35,00 --> 01:33:39,50
He stands. 

THE_VOW_DVS670
01:33:55,00 --> 01:33:59,50
Her gaze flickers over him. 

THE_VOW_DVS671
01:33:59,00 --> 01:34:04,50
He eyes her lovingly and gives a faint smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS673
01:34:03,00 --> 01:34:09,50
Seen in slow motion, SOMEONE<Paige> hugs him, her chin pressing firmly to his shoulder. 

THE_VOW_DVS674
01:34:10,00 --> 01:34:19,50
Now in the alley by the flowerpot garden, fall turns to winter. Snow veils SOMEONE’s<Paige’s> clay scrap pile. 

THE_VOW_DVS675
01:34:24,00 --> 01:34:29,50
Now Page paints animals on a nursery wall. 

THE_VOW_DVS676
01:34:29,00 --> 01:34:34,50
Her pregnant sister smiles, watching. 

THE_VOW_DVS677
01:34:34,00 --> 01:34:42,50
The sisters admire the mural which shows a giraffe, an elephant, and a lion balancing atop round trees. 

THE_VOW_DVS678
01:34:44,00 --> 01:34:50,50
SOMEONE<Leo> listens as a band records in his studio. 

THE_VOW_DVS679
01:34:49,00 --> 01:34:55,50
In a new apartment, SOMEONE<Paige> ladles her parents’ soup. 

THE_VOW_DVS680
01:34:56,00 --> 01:35:01,50
The cat lies on SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> stomach. 

THE_VOW_DVS681
01:35:06,00 --> 01:35:10,50
SOMEONE<Paige> sculpts in her apartment. 

THE_VOW_DVS682
01:35:17,00 --> 01:35:27,50
Rifling through an unpacked box, SOMEONE<Paige> finds the SOMEONE<Café> Mnemonic menu with her vows written on it. She reads. 

THE_VOW_DVS683
01:35:47,00 --> 01:35:56,50
A factory style window shows a nighttime view of a light snowfall and a car traveling the warmly lit street. 

THE_VOW_DVS684
01:35:53,00 --> 01:35:58,50
SOMEONE<Paige> looks away thoughtfully. 

THE_VOW_DVS685
01:35:55,00 --> 01:36:05,50
Now SOMEONE<Leo> holds his coat, closed around his neck as he walks past a row of snow dusted Christmas trees for sale. 

THE_VOW_DVS686
01:36:02,00 --> 01:36:08,50
Striding down a sidewalk with hunched shoulders, 

THE_VOW_DVS687
01:36:05,00 --> 01:36:10,50
he blows on his cupped hands. 

THE_VOW_DVS688
01:36:07,00 --> 01:36:12,50
As he reaches the entrance to SOMEONE Mnemonic, 

THE_VOW_DVS689
01:36:09,00 --> 01:36:15,50
he finds a note written on a menu taped to the glass. 

THE_VOW_DVS690
01:36:12,00 --> 01:36:17,50
It reads, snow day. 

THE_VOW_DVS691
01:36:14,00 --> 01:36:19,50
He gives a disappointed look. 

THE_VOW_DVS692
01:36:17,00 --> 01:36:23,50
Meanwhile SOMEONE<Paige> heads toward the SOMEONE<Café>. 

THE_VOW_DVS693
01:36:22,00 --> 01:36:29,50
Turning from the entrance SOMEONE<Leo> starts to walk off, but spots SOMEONE<Paige> approaching. 

THE_VOW_DVS694
01:36:27,00 --> 01:36:33,50
She stops and puts her hands in her coat pockets. 

THE_VOW_DVS695
01:36:34,00 --> 01:36:39,50
Grinning, she steps closer. 

THE_VOW_DVS696
01:36:38,00 --> 01:36:44,50
He gazes tenderly at her, then glances at the SOMEONE<Café>. 

THE_VOW_DVS697
01:37:14,00 --> 01:37:19,50
He stares at her radiant smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS698
01:37:33,00 --> 01:37:37,50
He smiles. 

THE_VOW_DVS699
01:37:36,00 --> 01:37:41,50
His eyes shine with tears. 

THE_VOW_DVS700
01:37:40,00 --> 01:37:46,50
She nods then lifts her eyes to the falling snow. 

THE_VOW_DVS701
01:37:43,00 --> 01:37:47,50
He follows her gaze skyward. 

THE_VOW_DVS702
01:38:27,00 --> 01:38:33,50
The corners of SOMEONE’s<Leo’s> mouth tug into a smile. 

THE_VOW_DVS703
01:38:39,00 --> 01:38:43,50
She shakes her head. 

THE_VOW_DVS704
01:38:40,00 --> 01:38:46,50
Stifling a grin, he gives a satisfied nod. 

THE_VOW_DVS705
01:38:57,00 --> 01:39:02,50
They head down the sidewalk. 

THE_VOW_DVS706
01:39:10,00 --> 01:39:17,50
She takes his arm as they head down the snowy street in the opposite direction. 

THE_VOW_DVS707
01:39:14,00 --> 01:39:19,50
An L train glides overhead. 

THE_VOW_DVS708
01:39:22,00 --> 01:39:28,50
Our view widens to show the glittering city scape.
