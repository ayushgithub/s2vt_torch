00:02:42,00 --> 00:02:51,50

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS17
00:02:48,00 --> 00:02:54,50
Using the captured guard as a shield, SOMEONE<Tuck> advances.

The surviving Heinrich brother lands safely and slides his parachute off his back. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS34
00:04:20,00 --> 00:04:35,50
He glances up at the skyscraper then moves to SOMEONE's<Jonas's> body which lies sprawled on the car's crushed roof. The rugged Heinrich finds the patch of fabric torn from SOMEONE's<FDR's> suit, still in his brother's clinched hand. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS35
00:04:32,00 --> 00:04:38,50
He takes it then lifts his gaze to the helipad. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS36
00:04:35,00 --> 00:04:42,50

Later, she enters a sushi restaurant. The chefs behind the bar cheer. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS55
00:07:51,00 --> 00:07:57,50
She gives a dispirited look then heads over. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS56
00:07:55,00 --> 00:08:01,50
One of the chef hands her a warm towel as she sits. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS57
00:08:05,00 --> 00:08:10,50
She drops her face in the towel.

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS70
00:12:07,00 --> 00:12:14,50
He removes his sunglasses and stares. Sliding off his jacket, he smirks. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS71
00:12:11,00 --> 00:12:16,50
Now at a Karate Dojo. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS72
00:12:16,00 --> 00:12:20,50
Two boys face each other. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS73
00:12:20,00 --> 00:12:26,50
A burly father watches his son square off with SOMEONE's<Tuck's> smaller one.

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS80
00:13:24,00 --> 00:13:32,50
As they exit the dojo together, an SUV pulls up and a pretty brunette waves from the driver seat. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS81
00:13:33,00 --> 00:13:37,50
SOMEONE<Joe> climbs in back. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS82

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS91
00:14:52,00 --> 00:14:57,50
His opponent flips him to a mat. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS92
00:14:54,00 --> 00:15:00,50

Crossing the office, he glances over her outfit. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS99
00:15:26,00 --> 00:15:31,50
Looking back, she heads across the testing area. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS100
00:15:40,00 --> 00:15:49,50
SOMEONE steps around her computer and finds in itsfate. net profile with her picture and the headline, Come and Get It Boys.

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS105
00:17:37,00 --> 00:17:42,50
He takes off his sunglasses and she does the same. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS106
00:17:52,00 --> 00:17:56,50
They sit across from each other. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS107
00:18:22,00 --> 00:18:32,50
A movie plays on a TV at a video store. SOMEONE<FDR> takes an escalator down to a lower floor, observing a variety of single women. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS108
00:18:30,00 --> 00:18:35,50
He smiles at a dark-haired woman strolling by. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS109
00:18:35,00 --> 00:18:41,50
He checks out a short-haired woman then takes out his cellphone and reads a text message. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS111
00:19:00,00 --> 00:19:05,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> nods emphatically. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS112
00:19:47,00 --> 00:19:54,50

She heads off with another movie. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS118
00:21:41,00 --> 00:21:47,50
SOMEONE<FDR> watches her go then shakes his head and leaves as well. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS119
00:21:44,00 --> 00:21:49,50
Now at the field office with the tech.

She rolls her eyes and he walks off with a grin. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS128
00:23:43,00 --> 00:23:49,50
Now an aerial view, roves pass downtown Los Angeles. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS129

At the CIA Field Office, SOMEONE<Tuck> and SOMEONE<FDR> work at their opposing desks. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS130
00:24:20,00 --> 00:24:26,50
Each man turns his laptop to reveal a photo of the same woman. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS131
00:25:39,00 --> 00:25:47,50
SOMEONE<FDR> shuts his laptop. SOMEONE<Tuck> does the same. Then resumes work at his desktop computer. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS133

In a darkened corridor. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS144
00:28:56,00 --> 00:29:00,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> covers SOMEONE's<Lauren's> eyes. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS145
00:28:59,00 --> 00:29:05,50
He reveals a trapeze structure adorned with lights in the middle of a circus ring. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS146
00:29:06,00 --> 00:29:10,50
He takes her hand. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS147
00:29:08,00 --> 00:29:14,50
As SOMEONE<Tuck> swings, SOMEONE<Lauren> stands on a platform.

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS150
00:29:23,00 --> 00:29:29,50
She jumps from the platform and swings out over the net. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS151
00:29:28,00 --> 00:29:36,50
Hanging on by their legs, they grab each other's wrists. SOMEONE<Lauren> lets go and swings with SOMEONE<Tuck>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS152
00:29:36,00 --> 00:29:42,50
He lets her fall and she lands on the net, bouncing high into the air. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS153
00:29:40,00 --> 00:29:48,50
He lets himself fall and bounce as well. Then they roll into the middle and lie side by side. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS154
00:29:59,00 --> 00:30:04,50

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS156
00:30:04,00 --> 00:30:13,50

As his colleagues move on, SOMEONE<Tuck> shifts his gaze. Now with the tech. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS163
00:31:27,00 --> 00:31:32,50
He steps aside with his hands in his pockets. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS164
00:31:34,00 --> 00:31:42,50
A satellite view zooms in on a street, tracking an Audi convertible which loops around and parks outside a busy nightclub. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS165
00:31:40,00 --> 00:31:47,50
SOMEONE<FDR> hops out of the sports car and joins SOMEONE<Lauren> who stands in a long line to get in.

A bartender hands him a bottle of wine. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS178
00:32:43,00 --> 00:32:55,50
SOMEONE<FDR> turns to find SOMEONE<Lauren> missing from her chair. He peers across the dance floor then heads after her. Outside, as SOMEONE<Lauren> crosses the street, SOMEONE<FDR> catches up. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS179
00:33:35,00 --> 00:33:40,50
She spots SOMEONE<Steve> and SOMEONE<Kelly>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS180
00:33:38,00 --> 00:33:43,50
She grabs SOMEONE<FDR> as he walks away. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS181
00:33:50,00 --> 00:33:56,50
She pulls him into a passionate kiss as the happy couple arrives. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS182
00:34:09,00 --> 00:34:14,50
SOMEONE<FDR> glares at her. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS183
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:23,50
She glances at SOMEONE<FDR>. He finally turns to SOMEONE<Steve> and offers his hand. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS185
00:34:55,00 --> 00:35:00,50
She smacks him playfully. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS186
00:34:59,00 --> 00:35:04,50
SOMEONE<Steve> and SOMEONE<Kelly> watch them kiss again. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS187
00:35:50,00 --> 00:35:54,50
Later at Pizzeria. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS188
00:36:20,00 --> 00:36:24,50
He smiles. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS189
00:36:22,00 --> 00:36:27,50
He taps his temple and she brightens. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS190
00:36:30,00 --> 00:36:36,50
An aerial view shows the city at dawn. At the field office. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS191
00:36:38,00 --> 00:36:43,50
SOMEONE<FDR> strolls cheerfully through a bullpen. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS192
00:36:42,00 --> 00:36:47,50
Turning, he finds a bald agent grinning at him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS193
00:36:44,00 --> 00:36:50,50
SOMEONE's<FDR's> smile fades to a comprehending scowl. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS194
00:36:47,00 --> 00:36:55,50
He marches into the work area he shares with SOMEONE<Tuck> and finds him sitting casually at his desk. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS196
00:37:38,00 --> 00:37:46,50
He drops the file in front of SOMEONE<Tuck>. It contains a photo of the blunt-featured SOMEONE<Ivan>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS197
00:37:43,00 --> 00:37:47,50
SOMEONE<FDR> sits at his own desk. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS198
00:38:11,00 --> 00:38:16,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> gestures bashfully. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS199
00:38:40,00 --> 00:38:44,50
SOMEONE<FDR> looks up from a file. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS200
00:38:52,00 --> 00:38:56,50
Now they hold separate briefings. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS201
00:39:33,00 --> 00:39:40,50
Now in a stylish home, SOMEONE<Lauren> dances in a kitchen as she makes microwave popcorn. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS202
00:39:39,00 --> 00:39:46,50
A window behind her shows SOMEONE<Tuck> lowering to the ground on a cable. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS204
00:39:48,00 --> 00:39:57,50
Wearing shorts, a big comfy shirt, and a ponytail, she struts into the living room and turns on a flat screen TV. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS205
00:39:54,00 --> 00:40:00,50
Behind her, SOMEONE<Tuck> creeps in and ducks behind a couch. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS206
00:39:58,00 --> 00:40:03,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> returns to the kitchen obliviously. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS207
00:40:00,00 --> 00:40:07,50
Getting to his feet, SOMEONE<Tuck> peers at her bookshelf and notices models of vintage sports cars. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS208
00:40:05,00 --> 00:40:13,50
In the kitchen, she swivels her hips as she wipes out her popcorn bowl. As she leaves the kitchen, he darts out. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS209
00:40:16,00 --> 00:40:24,50
She passes stairs, steps through a doorway, and shuts it behind her. SOMEONE<FDR> darts down the stairs. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS210
00:40:22,00 --> 00:40:29,50
He glides over to a lamp and sticks a tiny device under the shade's cross-beamed frame. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS211
00:40:27,00 --> 00:40:34,50
Noticing a framed poster for a Gustav Klimt Exhibit, he studies it closely. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS212
00:40:31,00 --> 00:40:39,50
SOMEONE<FDR> ducks around a doorway and hides as SOMEONE<Lauren> comes out and eyes an open laptop. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS213
00:40:38,00 --> 00:40:45,50
SOMEONE<FDR> notices a website for a pet shelter on her browser. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS214
00:40:42,00 --> 00:40:48,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> waves her hands in the air as she dances to her microwave. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS215
00:40:46,00 --> 00:40:54,50
SOMEONE<FDR> ducks behind the kitchen island then darts around a corner as she takes out her popcorn. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS216
00:40:54,00 --> 00:40:59,50
Behind her, SOMEONE<FDR> dashes off outside. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS218
00:41:06,00 --> 00:41:13,50
Now at his desk, SOMEONE<Tuck> throws a crumpled paper ball at a waste basket and misses. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS219
00:41:10,00 --> 00:41:16,50
A paper ball flying from another direction goes in. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS220
00:41:13,00 --> 00:41:21,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> faces SOMEONE<FDR> who blows on his fingers like a gun barrel and flashes a cocky smile. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS221
00:41:18,00 --> 00:41:23,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> tries again and his paper ball goes in. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS222
00:41:21,00 --> 00:41:26,50
Their feet on their desks, they take turns throwing. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS223
00:41:38,00 --> 00:41:44,50
Now a marquee reads, The Penthouse - Beautiful Girls Nightly. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS224
00:41:53,00 --> 00:41:59,50
As a bouncer moves aside, SOMEONE<Tuck> faces his partner. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS225
00:42:00,00 --> 00:42:04,50
He sniffs SOMEONE<FDR>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS226
00:42:06,00 --> 00:42:13,50
Leaning on SOMEONE<FDR>, SOMEONE<Tuck> staggers drunkenly into a backroom where men play cards. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS227
00:42:30,00 --> 00:42:35,50
SOMEONE<Ivan> glares at him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS228
00:42:40,00 --> 00:42:45,50
SOMEONE<Ivan> stands revealing his powerful build. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS229
00:42:46,00 --> 00:42:53,50
SOMEONE's<Ivan's> poker buddies draw guns and fires as he flees. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS230
00:42:50,00 --> 00:42:55,50
Dropping to the floor, the agent shoot their assailants. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS232
00:43:00,00 --> 00:43:08,50
As he runs through a doorway, a bald man tosses SOMEONE<Ivan> a shotgun then attacks SOMEONE<FDR>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS233
00:43:05,00 --> 00:43:11,50
The agent fights back, wrapping a payphone cord around his neck. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS234
00:43:10,00 --> 00:43:20,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> drops to the floor as SOMEONE<Ivan> shoots. The blast misses him and SOMEONE<Ivan> flees. SOMEONE<Tuck> and SOMEONE<FDR> give chase, dropping the bald man. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS235
00:43:17,00 --> 00:43:24,50
Reaching the main floor, SOMEONE<Ivan> trips then draws an ankle pistol and aims. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS237
00:43:23,00 --> 00:43:37,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> forces a patron down and SOMEONE<Ivan> shot misses again. SOMEONE<FDR> dashes over the bar then somersaults across the table. As SOMEONE<Ivan> reaches the dancer stage, SOMEONE<FDR> knocks him down and falls away. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS238
00:43:34,00 --> 00:43:46,50
Arriving, SOMEONE<Tuck> disarms SOMEONE<Ivan> and slams him against the pole. SOMEONE<FDR> charges but SOMEONE<Ivan> kicks him away. SOMEONE<Tuck> forces SOMEONE<Ivan> down and SOMEONE<FDR> punches him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS239
00:43:43,00 --> 00:43:51,50
While his partner straps SOMEONE's<Ivan's> neck and cuffs him to the pole, SOMEONE<FDR> holds him at gun point. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS241
00:43:55,00 --> 00:44:00,50
Later, they haul SOMEONE<Ivan> into the field office. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS242
00:44:03,00 --> 00:44:07,50
I'm not saying anything. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS243
00:44:13,00 --> 00:44:19,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> eyes his cell. It reads, Boyles - urgent check in. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS244
00:44:16,00 --> 00:44:22,50
SOMEONE<FDR> gets a text from SOMEONE<Bothwick> reading, mission alert. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS247
00:44:51,00 --> 00:44:55,50
Now at SOMEONE's<Lauren's> house. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS248
00:45:11,00 --> 00:45:16,50
She shows the photo of SOMEONE<FDR>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS249
00:45:28,00 --> 00:45:35,50
As SOMEONE<FDR> spies on the women from a surveillance truck, SOMEONE<Tuck> burst in on him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS250
00:46:54,00 --> 00:46:59,50
Both men listen worriedly. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS251
00:47:06,00 --> 00:47:11,50
SOMEONE<FDR> faces his cackling friend. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS252
00:47:16,00 --> 00:47:20,50
His smile vanishes. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS253
00:47:44,00 --> 00:47:49,50
The men meet separately with their team leaders. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS255
00:48:00,00 --> 00:48:04,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> rides in the Camaro with her. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS256
00:48:10,00 --> 00:48:18,50
A spy drone flies into view behind them. Tilting his side mirror, SOMEONE<Tuck> spots it. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS257
00:48:15,00 --> 00:48:23,50
From a surveillance room, SOMEONE<FDR> watches footage from its camera. SOMEONE<Tucks> sticks up his middle finger. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS258
00:48:23,00 --> 00:48:32,50
Behind his back, he discreetly draws a gun then makes a show of resting his hand behind SOMEONE's<Lauren's> seat back. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS259
00:48:29,00 --> 00:48:34,50
He shoots the drone, destroying it. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS260
00:48:38,00 --> 00:48:45,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> raises both hands, SOMEONE<Tuck> grabs the wheel. The briefings continue. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS261
00:48:56,00 --> 00:49:02,50
Now SOMEONE<FDR> takes SOMEONE<Lauren> to an enormous art vault. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS262
00:48:59,00 --> 00:49:06,50
In an alcove, several paintings by Klimt stand propped against crates. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS263
00:49:20,00 --> 00:49:26,50
At a remote location, SOMEONE<Bothwick> speaks into a headset. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS265
00:50:02,00 --> 00:50:06,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> frowns. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS266
00:50:03,00 --> 00:50:08,50
With SOMEONE<Tuck>, SOMEONE<Boyles> giggles mischievously. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS268
00:50:27,00 --> 00:50:31,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE<Tuck> laughs. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS269
00:50:35,00 --> 00:50:40,50
He takes her to a draped painting. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS270
00:50:39,00 --> 00:50:45,50
He unveils it, revealing Klimt's romantic masterpiece, The Kiss. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS271
00:50:47,00 --> 00:50:52,50
It depicts a man kissing a woman's face. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS272
00:50:54,00 --> 00:51:01,50
She takes SOMEONE's<FDR's> arm as she gazes wistfully at the stylized yet tender image. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS273
00:50:58,00 --> 00:51:05,50
The agent's expression softens affectionately and he faces the painting. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS274
00:51:09,00 --> 00:51:14,50
They share a smile. Later, a phone call. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS275
00:51:18,00 --> 00:51:22,50
In surveillance. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS276
00:51:27,00 --> 00:51:33,50
SOMEONE<Bothwick> brings up a video feed from SOMEONE's<Lauren's> house. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS277
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:53,50
SOMEONE's<FDR's> smile fades. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS278
00:51:50,00 --> 00:51:55,50
Now he takes SOMEONE<Lauren> to a dog shelter. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS279
00:52:08,00 --> 00:52:13,50
He high fives a boy. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS280
00:52:22,00 --> 00:52:27,50
She faces a tiny mutt's cage. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS281
00:52:26,00 --> 00:52:31,50
SOMEONE<FDR> starts to open it. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS282
00:52:36,00 --> 00:52:44,50
As SOMEONE<Lauren> moves on to the terrier's cage, the tiny mutt springs out and attacks SOMEONE<FDR>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS283
00:52:46,00 --> 00:52:54,50
The terrier jumps up and down in front of SOMEONE<Lauren>. With great effort, SOMEONE<FDR> wrestles the mutt into submission. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS284
00:52:52,00 --> 00:52:57,50
Turning, SOMEONE<Lauren> smiles fondly at them. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS285
00:52:54,00 --> 00:52:59,50
He puts the dog back in its cage. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS286
00:53:01,00 --> 00:53:06,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> brushes more hair off his shirt. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS288
00:53:26,00 --> 00:53:31,50
Later, SOMEONE<Tuck> spies on SOMEONE<Lauren> and SOMEONE<Trish>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS289
00:53:47,00 --> 00:53:52,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> frowns. Now at a paintball park. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS290
00:54:07,00 --> 00:54:14,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> sweeps curtains of netting apart revealing men and boys on a paintball field. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS292
00:54:13,00 --> 00:54:18,50
He swings out from a rail, kicking a man down. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS293
00:54:16,00 --> 00:54:21,50
He disarms another. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS294
00:54:18,00 --> 00:54:26,50
Crouching on a deck, he shoots the players hiding beneath then beacons SOMEONE<Lauren> with the wave. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS295
00:54:26,00 --> 00:54:30,50
She fumbles with goggles. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS296
00:54:31,00 --> 00:54:36,50
Now they peek out from behind a partition. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS297
00:54:37,00 --> 00:54:45,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> whips around and shoots players surrounding him. He hits two in their helmets. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS298
00:54:45,00 --> 00:54:48,50
In a bunker. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS299
00:54:47,00 --> 00:54:54,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> drops onto the roof and throws in a canister. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS300
00:54:52,00 --> 00:55:03,50
He swings away, leaving the kids staring from the bunker windows. Blue paint sprays out from inside. SOMEONE<Tuck> leaps from post to post up to a tower with a flag. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS301
00:55:02,00 --> 00:55:09,50
He yanks a man from the tower, grabs the flag and proudly shows it to SOMEONE<Lauren>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS302
00:55:09,00 --> 00:55:13,50
He nimbly climbs down to her. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS303
00:55:36,00 --> 00:55:41,50
Her gun shoots him in the crouch. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS304
00:55:52,00 --> 00:55:56,50
He straightens his face flushed. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS305
00:55:56,00 --> 00:56:00,50
At the gymboree. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS306
00:57:00,00 --> 00:57:04,50
SOMEONE<FDR> shakes his hand. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS307
00:57:03,00 --> 00:57:07,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> checks his watch. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS308
00:57:10,00 --> 00:57:14,50
Later, with Agent SOMEONE<Bothwick>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS309
00:57:15,00 --> 00:57:20,50
Now candles filled SOMEONE's<Tuck's> loft. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS310
00:57:30,00 --> 00:57:38,50
As they kiss, a monitor in the CIA surveillance room shows their glowing heat signature. SOMEONE<FDR> scowls. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS311
00:57:37,00 --> 00:57:42,50
A tech wearing glasses stands behind him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS312
00:57:41,00 --> 00:57:45,50
SOMEONE<Dickerman> presses a remote. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS313
00:57:43,00 --> 00:57:53,50
In the loft, the overhead fires sprinklers go off, extinguishing the candles and drenching SOMEONE<Tuck> and SOMEONE<Lauren>. SOMEONE<FDR> smirks. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS314
00:57:51,00 --> 00:57:56,50
On another day, SOMEONE<Tuck> walks with Agent SOMEONE<Boyles>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS315
00:57:56,00 --> 00:58:01,50
At SOMEONE's<FDR's> pad. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS316
00:58:08,00 --> 00:58:15,50
An old dog wheezes on his couch as they stop and kiss. SOMEONE<Lauren> pulls away. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS317
00:58:17,00 --> 00:58:27,50
She exists. SOMEONE<FDR> watches her go then excitedly grabs a wine bottle and two glasses and hurries over to the coffee table. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS318
00:58:26,00 --> 00:58:31,50
He sets them down then presses the remote. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS319
00:58:30,00 --> 00:58:36,50
He quickly lights a candle then almost sits down on his new pet. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS320
00:58:36,00 --> 00:58:41,50
He shoos the dog off the couch. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS322
00:58:42,00 --> 00:58:49,50
He pulls a dart from his neck. Looking out the window, he sees SOMEONE<Tuck> on the next roof. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS323
00:58:49,00 --> 00:59:01,50
Holding a tranquilizer rifle, his partner communicates with him using military hand signals then disappears. SOMEONE's<FDR's> knees slowly buckle and he collapses to the couch. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS324
00:59:04,00 --> 00:59:10,50
As he falls unconscious, SOMEONE<Lauren> returns. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS325
00:59:15,00 --> 00:59:21,50
The next day, SOMEONE<FDR> and SOMEONE<Tuck> stand in an elevator. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS326
00:59:25,00 --> 00:59:32,50
As they both try to exit at the same time, they get log-jammed. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS327
00:59:55,00 --> 00:59:59,50
They enter an interrogation room. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS328
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:18,50
He brandish his pliers. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS329
01:00:27,00 --> 01:00:32,50
Sitting handcuffed in a chair, SOMEONE<Ivan> chuckles. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS330
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:34,50
SOMEONE glares at SOMEONE 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS331
01:00:31,00 --> 01:00:35,50
who turns to their prisoner. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS333
01:00:38,00 --> 01:00:43,50
Sooner or later he'll be coming for you. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS335
01:00:45,00 --> 01:00:50,50
He glowers at SOMEONE's<Tuck's> poker face. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS336
01:00:49,00 --> 01:00:55,50
He turns his harsh eyes on SOMEONE<FDR> who gives a cool smirk. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS337
01:00:52,00 --> 01:01:06,50
Now a satellite view zooms out from the CIA Field Office rapidly relocates the Los Angeles harbor and zooms in. At a dock, a henchman clasps hands with Heinrich and helps him disembark off a fishing boat. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS338
01:01:07,00 --> 01:01:11,50
I'm sorry about SOMEONE<Jonas>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS339
01:01:09,00 --> 01:01:15,50
They get in one of two black Chevy Suburban’s waiting at a curb. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS340
01:01:12,00 --> 01:01:18,50
As the cars pull out, the picture fades to black. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS341
01:01:19,00 --> 01:01:25,50
Now SOMEONE<FDR> brings SOMEONE<Lauren> to his grandparents' estate. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS342
01:01:22,00 --> 01:01:28,50
His little nephew spins around with a bucket on his head then collapses. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS344
01:01:48,00 --> 01:01:53,50
She pulls SOMEONE<Lauren> away. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS345
01:01:50,00 --> 01:01:56,50
Left behind with a pie in his hand, SOMEONE<FDR> lets out a sigh. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS346
01:01:54,00 --> 01:02:00,50
Nana walks SOMEONE<Lauren> out to a stable where photographs clutter a wall. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS347
01:02:46,00 --> 01:02:50,50
At a family dinner. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS348
01:03:25,00 --> 01:03:30,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> raises her glass of white wine. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS349
01:03:31,00 --> 01:03:35,50
Everyone toasts. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS350
01:03:32,00 --> 01:03:37,50
That night, SOMEONE<FDR> walks SOMEONE<Lauren> to her house. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS351
01:03:56,00 --> 01:04:01,50
They both glance away shyly then look each other in the eyes. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS352
01:03:59,00 --> 01:04:03,50
SOMEONE<FDR> chuckles nervously. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS353
01:04:12,00 --> 01:04:18,50
The two surveillance teams watch from the CIA. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS354
01:04:16,00 --> 01:04:33,50
SOMEONE<FDR> and SOMEONE<Lauren> burst into her house. Kissing hungrily as they remove their coats. They start tearing off each other's clothes. She straddles his thighs as he lifts her onto the kitchen island. He whips off his blue button down shirt. Agent SOMEONE<Boyles> watches the video feed. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS355
01:04:34,00 --> 01:04:42,50
SOMEONE<FDR> lifts SOMEONE's<Lauren's> dress off over her head. She reclines with a sultry smile. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS356
01:04:39,00 --> 01:04:51,50
Back at the CIA Field Office, SOMEONE's<Boyles's> three colleagues crane their necks to watch. As SOMEONE<FDR> and SOMEONE<Lauren> lie kissing on the kitchen island, the picture fades to black. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS357
01:04:51,00 --> 01:04:57,50
The next morning, he lies asleep in her bed. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS358
01:04:54,00 --> 01:05:01,50
Dressed for work, SOMEONE<Lauren> tiptoes out from her bathroom and gathers her things. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS359
01:05:59,00 --> 01:06:04,50
He winces. SOMEONE<Lauren> makes a call as she heads out. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS360
01:06:38,00 --> 01:06:42,50
At the CIA. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS361
01:06:57,00 --> 01:07:03,50
Agent SOMEONE<Boyles> reluctantly takes it out of his breast pocket. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS363
01:07:16,00 --> 01:07:22,50
Avoiding eye contact, SOMEONE<Tuck> nods tensely. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS364
01:07:31,00 --> 01:07:38,50
He chucks the disk in the trash and storms off. Now SOMEONE<FDR> watches Titanic. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS365
01:07:36,00 --> 01:07:44,50
Standing at the prow of the ship, SOMEONE<Kate> Winslet looks out over the water. SOMEONE<FDR> smiles. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS366
01:07:46,00 --> 01:07:53,50
He goes to an elevator door and answers it to reveal a sexy woman in a flight attendant's uniform. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS367
01:08:17,00 --> 01:08:23,50
SOMEONE<Maya> gives a shock gape then nods and smiles politely. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS368
01:08:21,00 --> 01:08:26,50
The elevator doors slide shut. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS369
01:08:23,00 --> 01:08:30,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> closes his eyes and lifts his brow then returns to the living room. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS370
01:08:28,00 --> 01:08:32,50
Pausing in tracks. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS371
01:08:30,00 --> 01:08:35,50
He looks back over his shoulder toward the elevator. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS373
01:09:07,00 --> 01:09:13,50
The satellite view zooms out from the CIA Field Office. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS374
01:09:13,00 --> 01:09:19,50
It shifts to James Monroe Elementary. SOMEONE<Joe> comes out from the school. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS375
01:09:19,00 --> 01:09:25,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> stands by smiling as SOMEONE<Tuck> gives his son a hug. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS376
01:09:30,00 --> 01:09:35,50
SOMEONE<FDR> monitors the conversation. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS377
01:09:50,00 --> 01:09:59,50
At the Smart Consumer offices, SOMEONE<Joe> sits before a toy fire truck. SOMEONE<Lauren> gives him a hammer and lets him smash it to pieces. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS378
01:09:57,00 --> 01:10:03,50
Later, the three spray water at some test windows. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS380
01:10:04,00 --> 01:10:08,50
They spray him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS381
01:10:05,00 --> 01:10:10,50
A water fight ensues between all three of them. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS382
01:10:08,00 --> 01:10:14,50
Back in the surveillance room, SOMEONE<FDR> paces as he monitors the scene. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS384
01:10:16,00 --> 01:10:20,50
She waves from his truck. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS385
01:10:18,00 --> 01:10:24,50
SOMEONE's<Tuck's> ex comes out of her and watches him give SOMEONE<Joe> a hug. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS386
01:10:24,00 --> 01:10:29,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> smiles as he returns to his truck. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS387
01:10:26,00 --> 01:10:31,50
Back in the surveillance room. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS388
01:10:40,00 --> 01:10:48,50
On screen, a satellite zooms in on SOMEONE's<Tuck's> vehicle as it pulls over to the side of the road. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS389
01:10:45,00 --> 01:10:52,50
SOMEONE<FDR> sits and watches SOMEONE<Lauren> and SOMEONE's<Tuck's> heat signatures in the front seat. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS391
01:11:00,00 --> 01:11:07,50
As SOMEONE<Tuck> pulls away, their noses graze and their lips linger an inch apart. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS392
01:11:06,00 --> 01:11:11,50
They meet in a tender kiss. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS393
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:15,50
SOMEONE<FDR> shuts his eyes and bows his head. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS394
01:11:13,00 --> 01:11:20,50
Now the couple barges into SOMEONE's<Lauren's> house locked in a passionate embrace. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS395
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:30,50
As SOMEONE<Tuck> lifts SOMEONE<Lauren> up onto a console table, he discreetly removes the bug from the lamp and throws it on the floor. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS396
01:11:28,00 --> 01:11:35,50
As SOMEONE<Tuck> crashes it under his shoe, the surveillance team loses one of their angles. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS397
01:11:33,00 --> 01:11:40,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> leans SOMEONE<Lauren> over a dining table and reaches into a center piece. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS401
01:11:55,00 --> 01:12:00,50
SOMEONE<FDR> throws down a pair of headphones. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS402
01:12:00,00 --> 01:12:06,50
Now SOMEONE<Tuck> lays SOMEONE<Lauren> down on the couch. He kisses her neck. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS403
01:12:10,00 --> 01:12:15,50
SOMEONE<FDR> listens in. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS404
01:12:18,00 --> 01:12:24,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> tenderly strokes his cheek. In the surveillance room. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS405
01:12:26,00 --> 01:12:33,50
SOMEONE's<FDR's> head sinks and he covers his eyes. Daytime, at SOMEONE's<Trish's> house. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS407
01:13:08,00 --> 01:13:13,50
She lifts her son onto her lap. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS408
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:22,50
Now SOMEONE<Tuck> and SOMEONE<FDR> stand at their desks. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS409
01:13:46,00 --> 01:13:53,50
As SOMEONE<Tuck> takes a clip from his gun, SOMEONE<FDR> packs up his belongings in a file box. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS411
01:14:10,00 --> 01:14:15,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> takes his cellphone from his pocket. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS412
01:14:36,00 --> 01:14:41,50
Keeping his stare on SOMEONE<FDR>, SOMEONE<Tuck> ends the call. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS413
01:14:41,00 --> 01:14:47,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> shuts his laptop. Pockets his phone and grabs his jacket. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS414
01:14:50,00 --> 01:14:57,50
As SOMEONE<Tuck> strides out of the room, SOMEONE<FDR> stands motionless at his box of belongings. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS415
01:14:55,00 --> 01:15:02,50
Later, SOMEONE<FDR> enters the surveillance area with the box under his arm. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS416
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:05,50
He sets it down next to SOMEONE<Dickerman> watching surveillance footage. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS418
01:15:24,00 --> 01:15:29,50
SOMEONE<FDR> glances back at the footage and stops. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS419
01:15:28,00 --> 01:15:34,50
The camera zooms in from a wide view to a close up of the truck. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS420
01:15:31,00 --> 01:15:36,50
SOMEONE's<FDR's> eyes narrow. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS421
01:15:41,00 --> 01:15:45,50
They see a car parked behind the truck. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS422
01:15:44,00 --> 01:15:51,50
The tech complies. A zoomed in image clarifies, revealing the shadowy face of the driver. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS423
01:15:51,00 --> 01:15:56,50
SOMEONE<FDR> rushes out of the room. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS424
01:16:01,00 --> 01:16:06,50
SOMEONE<FDR> approaches. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS425
01:16:42,00 --> 01:16:46,50
She heads up some stairs. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS426
01:16:48,00 --> 01:16:54,50
SOMEONE<FDR> waves. Now SOMEONE<Trish> is bare feet, move up and down. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS427
01:16:52,00 --> 01:16:57,50
She rests from using her fitness ball. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS429
01:17:23,00 --> 01:17:29,50
As SOMEONE<FDR> nods and complies, SOMEONE<Tuck> gives him a slap on the cheek. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS430
01:17:31,00 --> 01:17:37,50
SOMEONE<FDR> faces SOMEONE<Tuck> then delivers a fast right hook. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS431
01:17:34,00 --> 01:17:40,50
In a posh ladies room, SOMEONE<Lauren> controls her breath. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS432
01:17:37,00 --> 01:17:49,50
In the chic restaurant, customers clear out as the two men brawl. SOMEONE<FDR> sends SOMEONE<Tuck> rolling over a table then throws a knife into a leather chair by SOMEONE's<Tuck's> head. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS433
01:17:51,00 --> 01:17:56,50
She sees food on her gum line. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS435
01:18:00,00 --> 01:18:06,50
SOMEONE<FDR> stuns SOMEONE<Tuck> with a throat punch. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS436
01:18:04,00 --> 01:18:09,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> wheels a coat rack like a quarterstaff. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS437
01:18:08,00 --> 01:18:14,50
SOMEONE<FDR> uses the pole to ram SOMEONE<Tuck> backward through a glass partition. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS439
01:18:13,00 --> 01:18:22,50
She mops her cleavage. Now SOMEONE<FDR> and SOMEONE<Tuck> scrap right over a balcony. They plummet 20 feet onto a table below. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS440
01:18:20,00 --> 01:18:25,50
In the ladies room. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS441
01:18:24,00 --> 01:18:31,50
Now bloody face then lying on glass shards, SOMEONE<FDR> feebly throws a fork at SOMEONE<Tuck>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS442
01:18:32,00 --> 01:18:36,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> comes down the stairs. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS443
01:19:04,00 --> 01:19:09,50
With disappointment in her eyes, SOMEONE<Lauren> turns away. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS444
01:19:09,00 --> 01:19:14,50
As she clears out, the two battered man wilt. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS445
01:19:11,00 --> 01:19:17,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> joins SOMEONE<Trish> in her convertible bug. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS446
01:19:21,00 --> 01:19:25,50
SOMEONE<Trish> hands her a sippy cup. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS447
01:19:37,00 --> 01:19:46,50
An SUV bumps them from behind. A second bumps them from the front. Trapping the car. Two men approach, one is Heinrich. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS448
01:19:50,00 --> 01:19:57,50
Heinrich signals an accomplice. In the trashed restaurant, the guys stand up. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS449
01:19:58,00 --> 01:20:02,50
Now they exit to the sidewalk. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS450
01:20:05,00 --> 01:20:10,50
It's SOMEONE's<Lauren's> cell calling. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS451
01:20:27,00 --> 01:20:32,50
Three SUVs escort SOMEONE's<Trish's> VW. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS452
01:20:44,00 --> 01:20:49,50
SOMEONE<FDR> manipulates his handheld. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS454
01:20:58,00 --> 01:21:02,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> flings the valet from the car. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS456
01:21:09,00 --> 01:21:14,50
SOMEONE<Boyles> takes the mic. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS457
01:21:12,00 --> 01:21:20,50
On the freeway, SOMEONE's<Trish's> convertible is escorted on three sides. The passenger side is unguarded. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS458
01:21:24,00 --> 01:21:38,50
As the Jeep comes up fast on the VW's unguarded side, SOMEONE<FDR> grips the roll bar and leans out. He leaps aboard the convertible and punches a thug in back, sending him tumbling. SOMEONE<FDR> grabs SOMEONE<Lauren>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS461
01:21:42,00 --> 01:21:50,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> shoots the tire on SOMEONE's<Trish's> car which veers off the road and catches air over a decorative man-made lake. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS462
01:21:51,00 --> 01:21:58,50
The huge splash blocks everything from view except a free flying license plate. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS463
01:21:56,00 --> 01:22:02,50
The water calms. SOMEONE<Trish> sits safely in the buoyant bobbing bug. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS464
01:21:59,00 --> 01:22:19,50
On the road, a gunman in one SUV fires on the jeep which evades to the right. Heinrich fires from another SUV. A return shot from SOMEONE<Tuck> tags Heinrich's shoulder. His car halts and he scolds, Drive you idiot. His driver slumps dead. Heinrich shoves the body out and drives on. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS466
01:22:26,00 --> 01:22:35,50
In a parking garage, two SUVs race their way. SOMEONE<Tuck> reverses as they advance head on. He beckons SOMEONE<Lauren>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS468
01:22:42,00 --> 01:22:54,50
The Jeep does a tight skidding 180, SOMEONE<Tuck> nearly falls out but SOMEONE<FDR> pulls him back in. As one SUV gunman aims at them, SOMEONE<Tuck> pulls his trigger and pegs the guy. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS469
01:22:59,00 --> 01:23:12,50
With a lug wrench, SOMEONE<Tuck> smashes the window of an enemy driver beside them. Hooks the stirring wheel and yanks. The SUV hits a column and explodes. Meanwhile, SOMEONE's<Tuck's> son watches TV. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS472
01:23:26,00 --> 01:23:46,50
Chased by another SUV, SOMEONE<FDR> throws a gas jug from the Jeep. As it bounces under the pursuer's bumper, the agents shoot it and it explodes. The SUV gets thrown upside down. Seeing the road's end, SOMEONE<Lauren> breaks. The Jeep spins to a sidelong halt within inches of the sheer drop. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS473
01:23:43,00 --> 01:23:48,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> sways outward precariously. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS474
01:23:45,00 --> 01:23:51,50
Two traffic cones plunge to the highway below. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS475
01:23:48,00 --> 01:23:54,50
SOMEONE<FDR> looks from SOMEONE<Tuck> to SOMEONE<Lauren>. His gaze intense and thoughtful. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS476
01:23:52,00 --> 01:23:56,50
He addresses SOMEONE<Lauren>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS477
01:24:19,00 --> 01:24:27,50
Heinrich's SUV speeds toward them. Standing on the road, SOMEONE<Tuck> and SOMEONE<FDR> both fire at it. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS478
01:24:24,00 --> 01:24:30,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> stands back by the Jeep, visible between the two agents. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS481
01:24:38,00 --> 01:24:45,50
The agents kneel. As the SUV rounds closer, they fire. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS482
01:24:43,00 --> 01:24:51,50
A deploying airbag wallops Heinrich's face and he careens into a mobile construction light. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS483
01:24:48,00 --> 01:24:56,50
The blast sends the SUV rolling sideways toward the road's unfinished end. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS484
01:24:53,00 --> 01:25:05,50
In slow motion, SOMEONE<FDR> and SOMEONE<Tuck> each race to one side. They both beacon SOMEONE<Lauren>, urging her to clear out of the way. But the tumbling SUV bares down swiftly. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS485
01:25:02,00 --> 01:25:09,50
Scene from the ground, the SUV and Jeep barrel over the edge and explode on impact. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS486
01:25:07,00 --> 01:25:14,50
A bird's-eye-view shows the black smoke hiding the end of the unfinished roadway. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS487
01:25:11,00 --> 01:25:18,50
The smoke thins and SOMEONE<Tuck> becomes visible, semi-reclined on the road. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS488
01:25:16,00 --> 01:25:21,50
Opposite him, SOMEONE<FDR> holds SOMEONE<Lauren>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS489
01:25:23,00 --> 01:25:28,50
SOMEONE's<Tuck's> squints at them, stunned and knowing. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS490
01:25:27,00 --> 01:25:34,50
SOMEONE<FDR> tenderly caresses her hair and SOMEONE<Lauren> peers longingly at him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS491
01:25:31,00 --> 01:25:37,50
As SOMEONE<Tuck> looks on, they both turn their attention to him. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS492
01:25:34,00 --> 01:25:41,50
He resiliently straightens his posture and gives a few curt nods of his head. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS493
01:25:42,00 --> 01:25:50,50
All three notice the news chopper. Meanwhile, SOMEONE's<Tuck's> son and ex-wife gawk at the TV. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS494
01:25:56,00 --> 01:26:02,50
Later, a paramedic faces SOMEONE<FDR>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS495
01:26:01,00 --> 01:26:10,50
Wrapped in a blanket, SOMEONE<Lauren> goes to SOMEONE<Tuck> who sits at the rear of an ambulance. He stands and they kiss each other's cheeks. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS496
01:26:14,00 --> 01:26:18,50
He looks to his friend. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS498
01:26:30,00 --> 01:26:35,50
SOMEONE<Lauren> gives him a warm smile. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS499
01:26:40,00 --> 01:26:45,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> lowers his gaze and nods shyly. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS500
01:26:46,00 --> 01:26:52,50
Heading off, he pauses and turns back to face his approaching friend. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS501
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:03,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> adjusts his wrist watch. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS502
01:27:04,00 --> 01:27:09,50
SOMEONE<FDR> regards his friend with a concerned frown. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS503
01:27:12,00 --> 01:27:15,50
They hug. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS504
01:27:19,00 --> 01:27:23,50
They part and SOMEONE<Tuck> heads off. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS505
01:27:23,00 --> 01:27:29,50
Rejoining SOMEONE<Lauren>, SOMEONE<FDR> wraps his arms around her. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS506
01:27:32,00 --> 01:27:38,50
His lips meet hers in a smoldering kiss. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS507
01:27:39,00 --> 01:27:44,50
They rock back and forth lingering in the embrace. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS508
01:27:41,00 --> 01:27:48,50
Looking up at SOMEONE<FDR>, SOMEONE<Lauren> shakes her head knowingly and smiles. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS509
01:27:51,00 --> 01:28:00,50
As they enjoy another kiss, we drift up and away from the unfinished overpass and gaze out over the city. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS510
01:27:57,00 --> 01:28:05,50
Now in the SOMEONE<Marshall> Arts Dojo, SOMEONE<Joe> and SOMEONE<Steven> face off again as both of their fathers look on. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS511
01:28:05,00 --> 01:28:14,50
As SOMEONE<Steven> charges, SOMEONE<Joe> swings his leg over the bigger boy's arm and flips him to the mat. He runs proudly to SOMEONE<Tuck>. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS513
01:28:25,00 --> 01:28:30,50
Leaning on SOMEONE<Tuck>, the man obeys with effort. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS514
01:28:34,00 --> 01:28:38,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> pats his back. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS515
01:28:39,00 --> 01:28:46,50
As SOMEONE<Joe> steps away, SOMEONE<Tuck> shyly approaches his ex who waits for him in a doorway. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS516
01:28:45,00 --> 01:28:51,50
She smiles and glances away. Her wide eyes glistening. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS517
01:28:56,00 --> 01:29:01,50
He presents himself to her humbly. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS518
01:28:58,00 --> 01:29:05,50
Leaning against the door frame, she steps forward and extends a hand. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS519
01:29:06,00 --> 01:29:12,50
SOMEONE's<Tuck's> brow lifts in a delighted smile, he shakes her hand. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS520
01:29:28,00 --> 01:29:35,50
With a tearful smile, she gestures SOMEONE<Tuck> to follow her as she goes over to her son. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS521
01:29:34,00 --> 01:29:41,50
In slow motion, the reunited family walks down a hallway together. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS522
01:29:40,00 --> 01:29:47,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> lays a hand on SOMEONE's<Katie's> back, gently ushering her through a doorway. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS523
01:29:44,00 --> 01:29:50,50
He follows with a hopeful gaze. Fade to black. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS524
01:29:47,00 --> 01:29:53,50
Now a military grade helicopter flies out at a night time mission. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS525
01:29:54,00 --> 01:29:58,50
Inside, SOMEONE<FDR> answers his cell. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS526
01:29:57,00 --> 01:30:01,50
In a sporty convertible. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS527
01:30:37,00 --> 01:30:41,50
In the helicopter. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS528
01:30:44,00 --> 01:30:49,50
They jump up and down, a hatch lowers. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS529
01:30:48,00 --> 01:30:53,50
SOMEONE<Tuck> checks SOMEONE's<FDR's> chute. 

THIS_MEANS_WAR_DVS530
01:31:22,00 --> 01:31:26,50
SOMEONE<FDR> stares at him.
