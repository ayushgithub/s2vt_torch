TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS22
00:02:46,00 --> 00:02:50,50
He lowers his hand from his heart. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS23
00:02:49,00 --> 00:02:58,50
SOMEONE<Derek> enters the penalty box, where he sits on a waiting recliner, puts his feet up, and rests his hands behind his head. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS24
00:02:56,00 --> 00:03:00,50
Fans bang on the glass. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS25
00:03:05,00 --> 00:03:13,50
Now, in the locker room, reporters gather around a young man. The muscle-bound SOMEONE<Derek> steps out. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS26
00:03:41,00 --> 00:03:46,50
SOMEONE<Derek> stares at the trendy kid. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS27
00:03:45,00 --> 00:03:50,50
He watches SOMEONE return to the reporters, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS28
00:03:47,00 --> 00:03:52,50
then glances around with a troubled expression. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS29
00:03:50,00 --> 00:03:54,50
Later, in the rink, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS30
00:03:51,00 --> 00:03:55,50
he approaches a group of fans. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS31
00:03:53,00 --> 00:04:00,50
As a zamboni passes, a grinning SOMEONE<Derek> accepts a pen from a curly-haired boy. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS32
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:20,50
SOMEONE<Derek> eyes the boy. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS33
00:05:07,00 --> 00:05:10,50
SOMEONE<Gabe> frowns. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS34
00:05:11,00 --> 00:05:16,50
The children's parents glare. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS35
00:05:15,00 --> 00:05:19,50
The boy lowers his gaze. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS36
00:05:16,00 --> 00:05:20,50
SOMEONE<Derek> winks. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS37
00:05:19,00 --> 00:05:24,50
Now, in a suburban neighborhood, a Corvette's license 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS39
00:05:23,00 --> 00:05:29,50
Indoors, SOMEONE<Derek> clowns, wearing French fries like fangs. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS40
00:05:29,00 --> 00:05:33,50
A girl and mother smile. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS41
00:05:37,00 --> 00:05:42,50
A pre-teen boy glowers. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS42
00:05:44,00 --> 00:05:50,50
The moppy-haired boy goes to the fridge. SOMEONE<Derek> pretends to perish. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS43
00:05:52,00 --> 00:05:56,50
The girl makes fangs. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS44
00:05:55,00 --> 00:06:00,50
Her brunette mother crouches beside her. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS45
00:06:04,00 --> 00:06:08,50
She checks the new gap. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS46
00:06:15,00 --> 00:06:19,50
SOMEONE<Derek> shifts uncomfortably. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS47
00:06:21,00 --> 00:06:25,50
His mother reluctant. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS49
00:06:23,00 --> 00:06:26,50
SOMEONE<Derek> watches. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS51
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:37,50
SOMEONE<Derek> brings dinner plates to a counter. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS52
00:06:41,00 --> 00:06:45,50
She shoots him a look. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS53
00:06:47,00 --> 00:06:52,50
She caresses his cheek with her thumb. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS54
00:06:49,00 --> 00:06:53,50
He smiles and they kiss. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS55
00:07:00,00 --> 00:07:05,50
He chases the girl through the house. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS56
00:07:02,00 --> 00:07:08,50
SOMEONE<Derek> and four buddies play cards at the kitchen table. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS57
00:07:13,00 --> 00:07:17,50
SOMEONE<Derek> makes a face. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS58
00:07:33,00 --> 00:07:38,50
The guys stare and he gets up. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS59
00:07:44,00 --> 00:07:49,50
SOMEONE<Derek> glances through a doorway. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS60
00:07:46,00 --> 00:07:51,50
Now, the girl sleeps soundly in her bed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS61
00:07:49,00 --> 00:07:55,50
SOMEONE<Derek> reaches under her pillow and pulls out a dollar SOMEONE<bill>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS63
00:07:53,00 --> 00:07:57,50
Grinning at the money, he tiptoes out of her room. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS64
00:07:55,00 --> 00:08:00,50
Later in the kitchen, SOMEONE<Derek> holds a wad of cash. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS65
00:08:11,00 --> 00:08:15,50
The couple share a smile 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS66
00:08:12,00 --> 00:08:16,50
and SOMEONE<Derek> follows the guys. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS68
00:08:34,00 --> 00:08:41,50
SOMEONE's<Derek's> playful grin evaporates. His girlfriend searches the floor. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS69
00:09:03,00 --> 00:09:07,50
SOMEONE<Derek> shows his winning. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS71
00:09:10,00 --> 00:09:15,50
She mouths the word "Stop", then secretly goes through her purse behind the bed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS72
00:09:20,00 --> 00:09:25,50
Her mom holds up a dollar. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS73
00:09:27,00 --> 00:09:32,50
SOMEONE<Tess> smiles and hugs her mother. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS74
00:09:29,00 --> 00:09:34,50
The woman kisses her cheek, then glares at SOMEONE<Derek>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS76
00:09:54,00 --> 00:09:58,50
She hands him his jacket. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS77
00:09:56,00 --> 00:10:00,50
She starts off. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS78
00:10:02,00 --> 00:10:06,50
She goes upstairs. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS79
00:10:03,00 --> 00:10:08,50
SOMEONE<Derek> rattles a fist. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS81
00:10:08,00 --> 00:10:13,50
Now, his Corvette sits outside an apartment complex, where a second story light goes out. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS83
00:10:12,00 --> 00:10:17,50
In a darkened bedroom, SOMEONE<Derek> lies on his side and rubs his shoulder. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS84
00:10:14,00 --> 00:10:18,50
He rolls onto his back. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS85
00:10:19,00 --> 00:10:24,50
He stirs under the covers and rolls onto his stomach. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS86
00:10:24,00 --> 00:10:30,50
Two bulges form under SOMEONE's<Derek's> shirt on his upper back. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS87
00:10:27,00 --> 00:10:31,50
SOMEONE<Derek> wiggles his shoulder. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS88
00:10:29,00 --> 00:10:35,50
As he lies still, his hands find a glowing document under the pillow. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS89
00:10:33,00 --> 00:10:39,50
Its heading reads "Department of Dissemination of Disbelief" 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS90
00:10:36,00 --> 00:10:42,50
and demands his appearance at the Grand Hall of Tooth Fairy Land. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS92
00:10:51,00 --> 00:10:56,50
SOMEONE<Derek> sits up on the edge of his bed, flips on a lamp, and reads the summons. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS93
00:10:53,00 --> 00:11:00,50
As he chuckles, a pair of fluffy-edged wings spread open on his back. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS94
00:10:58,00 --> 00:11:04,50
Wide-eyed, SOMEONE<Derek> swallows, then glances nervously. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS95
00:11:01,00 --> 00:11:05,50
He approaches a mirror. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS96
00:11:03,00 --> 00:11:08,50
He stumbles back on the bed, then gets up. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS97
00:11:06,00 --> 00:11:10,50
SOMEONE<Derek> looks down. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS98
00:11:07,00 --> 00:11:13,50
Magical smoke envelops his feet and rises up his entire body, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS99
00:11:11,00 --> 00:11:21,50
leaving behind a fairy's pretty tights, tutu, and satiny bodice. As SOMEONE<Derek> grimaces, the magical smoke swirls overhead. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS100
00:11:19,00 --> 00:11:25,50
Loose papers fly and a wind blows blankets off the bed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS101
00:11:22,00 --> 00:11:29,50
SOMEONE<Derek> looks up, peering through a seemingly endless funnel of energy. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS102
00:11:26,00 --> 00:11:32,50
SOMEONE<Derek> blinks helplessly as lights glimmer on his frightened face. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS104
00:11:38,00 --> 00:11:43,50
Now, in his pretty dress, SOMEONE<Derek> stands in a grand hall. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS105
00:11:40,00 --> 00:11:47,50
Male and female fairies pass by. Some with wings, some without. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS106
00:11:44,00 --> 00:11:49,50
A female fairy flies overhead. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS107
00:11:47,00 --> 00:11:53,50
A male fairy's wing brushes SOMEONE's<Derek's> face and he bats at it. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS108
00:11:50,00 --> 00:11:59,50
Another male sneers at him. A female smiles. On a wall, a mechanical information board updates. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS109
00:11:56,00 --> 00:12:07,50
Name, tooth, location, and status. A listing about a canine in a tin can updates to a molar on a window sill. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS110
00:12:04,00 --> 00:12:16,50
SOMEONE<Derek> watches a flying female collect files from office worker fairies. She flies up to a map of the world and touches her wand to a location over Eastern Europe. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS111
00:12:13,00 --> 00:12:17,50
SOMEONE<Derek> gapes. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS112
00:12:20,00 --> 00:12:25,50
A gangly geeky man faces him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS113
00:12:23,00 --> 00:12:27,50
SOMEONE<Derek> grimaces. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS114
00:12:28,00 --> 00:12:32,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> sneers at SOMEONE's<Derek's> tutu. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS115
00:12:32,00 --> 00:12:37,50
Bald fairies pass with pamphlets. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS116
00:12:39,00 --> 00:12:44,50
A stocky male fairy walks up. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS117
00:13:28,00 --> 00:13:32,50
SOMEONE<Derek> puts on a beaming smile. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS118
00:13:32,00 --> 00:13:38,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> grins. The stocky fairy pantomimes flying. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS119
00:13:36,00 --> 00:13:41,50
SOMEONE<Derek> bolts, knocking other fairies down on his way. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS120
00:13:45,00 --> 00:13:51,50
Fairies point magic wands and drag him back to SOMEONE<Tracy>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS121
00:13:52,00 --> 00:13:55,50
He stands up. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS122
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:06,50
The wingless case worker pushes him, then smirks. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS123
00:14:07,00 --> 00:14:11,50
SOMEONE<Derek> pushes him back. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS124
00:14:09,00 --> 00:14:14,50
He rolls his shoulders and SOMEONE<Tracy> glances at the crowd. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS125
00:14:14,00 --> 00:14:18,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> takes off his glasses. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS126
00:14:22,00 --> 00:14:25,50
SOMEONE<Derek> shoves him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS127
00:14:26,00 --> 00:14:32,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> grabs the stocky fairy's magic wand. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS128
00:14:33,00 --> 00:14:38,50
Someone throws SOMEONE<Derek> a wand. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS129
00:14:42,00 --> 00:14:49,50
As he flexes his arms, his wand shoots fairy dust in his eyes. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS130
00:14:49,00 --> 00:14:54,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> pokes him with his wand. SOMEONE<Derek> grabs it. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS131
00:14:53,00 --> 00:14:57,50
He snaps it in two. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS132
00:14:58,00 --> 00:15:07,50
Everyone turns. A matronly four-winged fairy gracefully descends through sunbeams to the floor. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS133
00:15:04,00 --> 00:15:09,50
The captivated younger fairies gape. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS134
00:15:57,00 --> 00:16:00,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> grins. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS135
00:16:26,00 --> 00:16:31,50
SOMEONE<Derek> shakes his head, then furrows his brow. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS137
00:17:14,00 --> 00:17:18,50
She grins, then starts off. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS138
00:17:24,00 --> 00:17:28,50
She studies his dress. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS139
00:17:29,00 --> 00:17:34,50
She leans and SOMEONE<Tracy> mimes cracking an egg. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS140
00:17:37,00 --> 00:17:46,50
Now, SOMEONE<Tracy> waits among tall supply shelves. SOMEONE<Derek> arrives in a blue satin tunic and tights. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS146
00:17:54,00 --> 00:17:58,50
He tosses SOMEONE's<Tracy's> clipboard. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS147
00:17:57,00 --> 00:18:04,50
As SOMEONE<Tracy> fetches it, SOMEONE<Derek> finds an elderly fairy in a cardigan descending a ladder. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS148
00:18:06,00 --> 00:18:10,50
He hangs up a cellphone. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS150
00:18:25,00 --> 00:18:30,50
He glances aside, then gestures for SOMEONE<Derek> to crouch to his eye level. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS151
00:18:45,00 --> 00:18:49,50
His wing hits SOMEONE<Derek>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS152
00:18:53,00 --> 00:18:58,50
His wing brushes SOMEONE's<Derek's> face again. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS153
00:19:09,00 --> 00:19:14,50
SOMEONE<Derek> accepts the wand and avoids SOMEONE's<Jerry's> wing. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS154
00:19:39,00 --> 00:19:43,50
SOMEONE<Jerry> shows SOMEONE<Derek> a spray canister. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS155
00:19:47,00 --> 00:19:51,50
He grabs a tube of paste. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS156
00:20:27,00 --> 00:20:32,50
A tiny bone shape decorates each mint. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS157
00:20:33,00 --> 00:20:37,50
SOMEONE<Derek> takes one. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS158
00:20:53,00 --> 00:20:58,50
SOMEONE's<Derek's> eyes widen and SOMEONE<Jerry> nod. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS159
00:20:55,00 --> 00:20:59,50
The new fairy glances around. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS160
00:21:16,00 --> 00:21:20,50
He grabs a tiny canister. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS161
00:21:25,00 --> 00:21:29,50
He hurries off. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS163
00:21:32,00 --> 00:21:36,50
He holds up a little pouch. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS164
00:21:38,00 --> 00:21:42,50
He sprinkles it in SOMEONE's<Derek's> face. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS165
00:21:55,00 --> 00:22:00,50
Later, in utter whiteness, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS166
00:22:04,00 --> 00:22:09,50
a male fairy stands at a control station. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS167
00:22:23,00 --> 00:22:27,50
They pound fists. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS168
00:22:32,00 --> 00:22:38,50
Duke pulls a lever and SOMEONE<Derek> takes off. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS169
00:22:39,00 --> 00:22:45,50
He pushes another lever and a squirming SOMEONE<Derek> flies higher. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS171
00:22:59,00 --> 00:23:04,50
The case worker grabs a tennis ball from a bin. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS172
00:23:04,00 --> 00:23:09,50
He throws the ball, then grabs a racket. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS173
00:23:07,00 --> 00:23:13,50
A pitching machine fires ball after ball. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS174
00:23:10,00 --> 00:23:16,50
One nails SOMEONE's<Derek's> groin. Now, SOMEONE<Derek> stands at a check-in window. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS175
00:23:18,00 --> 00:23:24,50
SOMEONE<Derek> reluctantly raises his hand and glares at the winged clerk. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS176
00:23:35,00 --> 00:23:39,50
SOMEONE<Derek> balks. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS178
00:23:42,00 --> 00:23:47,50
The clerk glares. SOMEONE<Derek> sheepishly glances around, then gives in. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS179
00:23:51,00 --> 00:23:55,50
She eyes him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS180
00:24:04,00 --> 00:24:08,50
Now in an office. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS181
00:24:23,00 --> 00:24:29,50
He notices her tapping finger, then shakes his head. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS182
00:24:42,00 --> 00:24:46,50
She sprinkles fairy dust. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS183
00:24:43,00 --> 00:24:47,50
The screen goes white, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS184
00:24:45,00 --> 00:24:49,50
then SOMEONE<Derek> wakes up in bed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS185
00:24:46,00 --> 00:24:51,50
He glances at his surroundings. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS186
00:24:49,00 --> 00:24:54,50
He crosses his arms and feels his back for wings. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS187
00:24:52,00 --> 00:24:57,50
Finding nothing, he relaxes. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS188
00:25:01,00 --> 00:25:07,50
Now, SOMEONE<Carly> answers her door to find SOMEONE<Derek> holding a bouquet of roses. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS189
00:25:06,00 --> 00:25:11,50
She holds a few of Tess' dolls. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS190
00:25:16,00 --> 00:25:20,50
SOMEONE<Derek> eyes her steadily. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS191
00:25:20,00 --> 00:25:24,50
She barely smiles. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS192
00:25:28,00 --> 00:25:33,50
SOMEONE<Carly> raises her brow thoughtfully and nods. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS194
00:25:32,00 --> 00:25:39,50
With a playful look, SOMEONE<Derek> shifts his eyes to the bouquet of flowers then gives his girlfriend a winning grin. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS195
00:25:36,00 --> 00:25:42,50
She half stifles her smile as she accepts the bouquet. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS196
00:25:47,00 --> 00:25:53,50
SOMEONE's<Derek's> grin stays plastered on his face as he gives a few wobbling nods. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS198
00:25:59,00 --> 00:26:03,50
He turns away. SOMEONE<Carly> grins. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS199
00:26:03,00 --> 00:26:08,50
In his room, SOMEONE<Randy> plays guitar. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS200
00:26:13,00 --> 00:26:18,50
SOMEONE<Derek> enters with a hockey stick half wrapped in paper. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS201
00:26:16,00 --> 00:26:21,50
SOMEONE<Randy> keeps playing on his loft bed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS202
00:26:30,00 --> 00:26:34,50
He autographs it. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS203
00:26:36,00 --> 00:26:40,50
SOMEONE<Randy> rolls his eyes. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS204
00:26:40,00 --> 00:26:45,50
SOMEONE<Randy> glares at the stick then at SOMEONE<Derek>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS205
00:26:45,00 --> 00:26:50,50
SOMEONE<Derek> leans the stick against the bed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS206
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:51,50
He grins widely at SOMEONE<Randy>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS207
00:27:02,00 --> 00:27:06,50
SOMEONE<Randy> looks away. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS208
00:27:05,00 --> 00:27:09,50
He holds out his fist. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS209
00:27:06,00 --> 00:27:10,50
SOMEONE<Randy> ignores it. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS211
00:27:27,00 --> 00:27:31,50
Later at SOMEONE's<Derek's>. SOMEONE<Derek> grins. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS212
00:27:41,00 --> 00:27:45,50
She leans in and they kiss. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS213
00:27:43,00 --> 00:27:47,50
SOMEONE's<Derek's> phone lights up. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS214
00:27:46,00 --> 00:27:52,50
He grabs it from a nearby table and reads a text message. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS217
00:28:05,00 --> 00:28:09,50
He heads to the kitchen. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS218
00:28:15,00 --> 00:28:20,50
SOMEONE<Derek> gets whipped cream and strawberries from the fridge. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS219
00:28:17,00 --> 00:28:22,50
As he returns to the living room, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS220
00:28:19,00 --> 00:28:24,50
his fairy wings sprout from his back. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS221
00:28:22,00 --> 00:28:27,50
SOMEONE<Carly> paws at the air, her eyes still shut. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS222
00:28:28,00 --> 00:28:32,50
SOMEONE<Derek> grabs his phone. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS223
00:28:29,00 --> 00:28:34,50
As he turns away, he knocks over a lamp. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS224
00:28:34,00 --> 00:28:41,50
In the kitchen, light flashes and SOMEONE<Derek> finds himself in his tooth fairy uniform. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS225
00:28:53,00 --> 00:28:58,50
SOMEONE<Derek> rushes outside and answers his phone. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS226
00:29:22,00 --> 00:29:26,50
SOMEONE<Carly> stands in the doorway. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS227
00:29:31,00 --> 00:29:35,50
She leaves. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS228
00:29:42,00 --> 00:29:46,50
SOMEONE<Derek> creeps off. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS229
00:29:43,00 --> 00:29:51,50
Now, his wing sticks out of the driver's window of his Corvette as he pulls up in front of a house. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS230
00:29:48,00 --> 00:29:55,50
Waiting on the sidewalk, SOMEONE<Tracy> watches SOMEONE<Derek> climb out of the vehicle. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS231
00:29:59,00 --> 00:30:04,50
SOMEONE<Derek> swats a bent wing into place as he stands. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS232
00:30:01,00 --> 00:30:05,50
He approaches his case worker. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS233
00:30:58,00 --> 00:31:04,50
At the front door, SOMEONE<Derek> takes out his tube of shrinking paste. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS235
00:31:15,00 --> 00:31:20,50
Shaking his head skeptically, SOMEONE<Derek> twists the cap off the tube. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS236
00:31:22,00 --> 00:31:27,50
He lifts the tube to his lips. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS237
00:31:25,00 --> 00:31:30,50
SOMEONE<Derek> grimaces as he sucks on the tube. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS238
00:31:30,00 --> 00:31:35,50
He smacks his lips thoughtfully as he lowers 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS239
00:31:33,00 --> 00:31:37,50
He flicks his tongue. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS240
00:31:38,00 --> 00:31:43,50
He shrinks to only a few inches. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS241
00:31:47,00 --> 00:31:52,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> raises his foot at SOMEONE<Derek>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS242
00:32:05,00 --> 00:32:09,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> sets his foot down. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS243
00:32:06,00 --> 00:32:11,50
He drops a rolled up dollar. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS244
00:32:09,00 --> 00:32:15,50
In SOMEONE's<Derek's> hands, the dollar is the size of a rolled up poster. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS245
00:32:13,00 --> 00:32:19,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> glares sourly as SOMEONE<Derek> lies on his stomach and wriggles under the door. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS246
00:32:20,00 --> 00:32:26,50
He drops the rolled up dollar and slides back to retrieve it. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS247
00:32:26,00 --> 00:32:31,50
Now, he straightens on the other side of the door and looks around. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS248
00:32:29,00 --> 00:32:38,50
With the dollar strapped to his back, he cautiously tiptoes across a hardwood floor, making his way past a looming dining table. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS249
00:32:38,00 --> 00:32:42,50
He peers around a corner. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS250
00:32:43,00 --> 00:32:46,50
He pulls back. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS252
00:32:45,00 --> 00:32:50,50
With a frightened look, he steps out and stares at a sleeping cat. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS253
00:32:56,00 --> 00:33:03,50
SOMEONE<Derek> carefully sidesteps past the head of the sleeping tabby. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS254
00:33:03,00 --> 00:33:09,50
The cat's ear twitches as he passes in front of its face. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS255
00:33:09,00 --> 00:33:15,50
SOMEONE<Derek> stumbles as the tabby stretches. Its eyes remain closed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS256
00:33:13,00 --> 00:33:19,50
As SOMEONE<Derek> hurriedly tiptoes by, the cat shifts in its sleep. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS257
00:33:17,00 --> 00:33:22,50
Now, SOMEONE<Derek> slides under a bedroom door. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS258
00:33:25,00 --> 00:33:31,50
SOMEONE emerges on the other side of a door 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS259
00:33:28,00 --> 00:33:33,50
and spots a sleeping boy across the room. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS260
00:33:30,00 --> 00:33:36,50
A few toys show in silhouette underneath his bed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS261
00:33:33,00 --> 00:33:38,50
SOMEONE dashes to a night stand, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS263
00:33:41,00 --> 00:33:46,50
then frowns uncertainly at the towering bed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS264
00:33:43,00 --> 00:33:49,50
He grabs hold of a knob on the night stand and hoists himself up to the drawer above. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS265
00:33:46,00 --> 00:33:52,50
On the nearby bed, the blanket hangs over the side. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS266
00:33:49,00 --> 00:33:53,50
SOMEONE<Derek> leaps for it. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS267
00:33:53,00 --> 00:33:58,50
Clinging to the blanket, he climbs up. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS268
00:33:55,00 --> 00:34:02,50
He reaches the top and peeks over at the boy, whose chest rises rhythmically. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS270
00:34:02,00 --> 00:34:06,50
SOMEONE<Derek> glances around, then swings his legs up. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS271
00:34:06,00 --> 00:34:12,50
He stumbles slightly as the stands on the bed's plush surface. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS273
00:34:14,00 --> 00:34:18,50
With his gaze fixed on the boy's closed eyes, SOMEONE<Derek> creeps toward the headboard. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS274
00:34:16,00 --> 00:34:21,50
He takes a cautious step toward the boy's pillow, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS277
00:34:25,00 --> 00:34:29,50
He lifts it.  

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS278
00:34:32,00 --> 00:34:37,50
He crawls underneath the pillow. Using the lit tip of his wand, he searches under the pillow.  

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS279
00:34:35,00 --> 00:34:40,50
Creeping further under the pillow, he finds a tooth.  

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS280
00:34:38,00 --> 00:34:43,50
He grabs it and starts to wriggle back out.  

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS281
00:34:40,00 --> 00:34:45,50
With a quick glance over his shoulder, he leaves the rolled up dollar SOMEONE<bill> in its place. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS283
00:34:45,00 --> 00:34:50,50
SOMEONE<Derek> cautiously crawls out from under the pillow. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS284
00:34:50,00 --> 00:34:57,50
As he straightens, he looks at the boy, then turns to the edge of the bed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS285
00:34:57,00 --> 00:35:03,50
The boy rolls in his sleep, knocking SOMEONE<Derek> off the bed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS286
00:35:06,00 --> 00:35:11,50
SOMEONE<Derek> lands safely on the back of a plush alligator. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS287
00:35:09,00 --> 00:35:14,50
He rolls off and shakes out his arms. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS288
00:35:11,00 --> 00:35:15,50
The boy peers down at him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS289
00:35:12,00 --> 00:35:16,50
SOMEONE<Derek> jumps. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS291
00:35:22,00 --> 00:35:31,50
SOMEONE<Derek> scurries away. As he flattens himself against the wall, the boy's parents rush in. The flung open door whacks him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS292
00:35:33,00 --> 00:35:38,50
SOMEONE<Derek> peeks out from behind the door. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS293
00:35:37,00 --> 00:35:43,50
As SOMEONE<Derek> heads out, he comes face to face with the cat. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS294
00:35:47,00 --> 00:35:52,50
He scampers behind a miniature skateboard half pipe. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS295
00:35:51,00 --> 00:35:55,50
The tabby glares. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS296
00:35:52,00 --> 00:35:59,50
SOMEONE<Derek> reaches out from behind the half pipe and retrieves a tiny skateboard. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS297
00:35:56,00 --> 00:36:08,50
As the tabby stalks closer, SOMEONE<Derek> rides the skateboard up the half pipe and soars into the air. He winks at the cat as he passes over its head. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS298
00:36:07,00 --> 00:36:13,50
As he escapes down the hallway, the tabby bounds after him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS299
00:36:11,00 --> 00:36:17,50
SOMEONE<Derek> jumps off the skateboard. The tabby gains on him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS300
00:36:17,00 --> 00:36:21,50
He points his wand. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS301
00:36:20,00 --> 00:36:25,50
He races into the kitchen and skids to a stop. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS302
00:36:22,00 --> 00:36:28,50
Pressing his back against a wall, he swallows hard. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS303
00:36:26,00 --> 00:36:34,50
With a SOMEONE<grimace>, he peeks around the corner into the hallway and sees the tabby closing in. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS304
00:36:34,00 --> 00:36:39,50
He notices a cat door on the other side of the kitchen. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS305
00:36:36,00 --> 00:36:43,50
He reaches into his pouch, pulls out his cat away canister, and presses the nozzle button. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS306
00:36:43,00 --> 00:36:48,50
The tabby shoots upward then runs off. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS307
00:36:45,00 --> 00:36:52,50
SOMEONE<Derek> scurries across the kitchen and launches himself against the plastic cat door flap. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS308
00:36:49,00 --> 00:36:54,50
He tumbles outside then hurries away. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS309
00:36:58,00 --> 00:37:04,50
At home, SOMEONE's<Derek's> barely taller than his sofa. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS310
00:37:09,00 --> 00:37:13,50
She lies on the sofa. He sneaks by. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS312
00:37:14,00 --> 00:37:18,50
Now, at the rink. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS323
00:37:31,00 --> 00:37:35,50
SOMEONE<Derek> walks with SOMEONE<Mick>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS324
00:37:49,00 --> 00:37:57,50
SOMEONE<Mick> grins as he leaves SOMEONE<Derek> and joins his teammates on the ice. SOMEONE<Derek> eyes the crowd. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS326
00:37:59,00 --> 00:38:09,50
He steps out of the gangway and stares disbelievingly. Words on the scoreboard flash "Mick the Stick" in sync with the crowd's chanting. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS327
00:38:11,00 --> 00:38:23,50
In the center of the rink, SOMEONE<Mick> raises his arms to the crowd and lifts a gloved hand to his ear. He pumps his arms to the beat of the cheers, then skates over to SOMEONE<Derek>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS330
00:38:26,00 --> 00:38:33,50
As SOMEONE<Mick> glides away, SOMEONE<Derek> uneasily glances around the arena. Later. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS340
00:38:52,00 --> 00:39:00,50
SOMEONE<Mick> deftly dribbles the puck toward the opposing team's goal. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS344
00:39:02,00 --> 00:39:07,50
He works the puck between his skates. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS348
00:39:12,00 --> 00:39:23,50
A roughneck checks SOMEONE<Mick>. Behind him, SOMEONE<Derek> checks a roughneck. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS353
00:39:25,00 --> 00:39:31,50
As a player charges SOMEONE<Mick>, SOMEONE<Derek> starts over, then reads a message on the scoreboard. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS354
00:39:28,00 --> 00:39:34,50
"Kids asleep at 2631 Castle Heights. " 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS356
00:39:33,00 --> 00:39:42,50
He trips and falls face first. The charging roughneck mows SOMEONE<Mick> down. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS359
00:39:49,00 --> 00:39:55,50
SOMEONE<Mick> frowns at SOMEONE<Derek>, who smiles meagerly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS360
00:39:52,00 --> 00:39:57,50
A bulge sprouts at his shoulder under his jersey. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS361
00:39:55,00 --> 00:40:00,50
SOMEONE<Derek> hides it. Now in the locker room. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS363
00:40:01,00 --> 00:40:05,50
SOMEONE<Derek> hurries by. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS364
00:40:04,00 --> 00:40:10,50
He rushes into the bathroom and locks himself in a stall. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS365
00:40:10,00 --> 00:40:15,50
His wings burst out of his jersey. He ducks. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS367
00:40:18,00 --> 00:40:23,50
More teammates enter. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS368
00:40:21,00 --> 00:40:26,50
They look under SOMEONE's<Derek's> stall. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS369
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:36,50
They glimpse the powder blue tights on his toes. SOMEONE<Derek> squeezes his eyes shut and pushes the magic generator button on his wand. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS370
00:40:39,00 --> 00:40:45,50
Glancing at the toilet, SOMEONE<Derek> takes out his shrinking paste. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS371
00:40:45,00 --> 00:40:49,50
He eats some paste. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS372
00:40:48,00 --> 00:40:54,50
The players burst into the stall and find it empty. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS373
00:40:51,00 --> 00:40:56,50
They see only water swirling down the flushed toilet. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS374
00:40:54,00 --> 00:41:01,50
Now, SOMEONE<Tracy> waits on a sidewalk as SOMEONE<Derek> slams his Corvette door. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS375
00:41:09,00 --> 00:41:14,50
SOMEONE<Derek> storms up to a house. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS376
00:41:12,00 --> 00:41:16,50
And old man opens the front door. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS377
00:41:15,00 --> 00:41:20,50
He throws amnesia dust then steps inside. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS378
00:41:19,00 --> 00:41:24,50
He throws dust in the faces of all the family members. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS379
00:41:23,00 --> 00:41:27,50
Dust falls on a dog, whose eyes go goofy. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS381
00:41:26,00 --> 00:41:33,50
Now, SOMEONE<Derek> lifts a pillow and the head of the child sleeping on it, takes the tooth, and tosses down a dollar. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS383
00:42:04,00 --> 00:42:09,50
She shows the disoriented family members wandering around. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS384
00:42:12,00 --> 00:42:17,50
SOMEONE<Derek> smacks SOMEONE's<Tracy's> chest. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS385
00:42:14,00 --> 00:42:18,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> smacks him back. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS386
00:42:16,00 --> 00:42:20,50
They spot the googly-eyed dog. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS387
00:42:42,00 --> 00:42:46,50
Now, letters on double doors read "Break Room". 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS390
00:42:46,00 --> 00:42:52,50
a young fairy reads, while another peruses food in a display case at a counter. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS391
00:42:50,00 --> 00:42:54,50
SOMEONE<Derek> flips through a magazine. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS392
00:42:56,00 --> 00:43:01,50
He scowls at SOMEONE<Tracy>, who sits by him drinking. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS393
00:42:59,00 --> 00:43:07,50
The case worker freezes and stares dreamily at the gossamer wings of two fairies across the room, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS394
00:43:05,00 --> 00:43:10,50
the fluffy edges agleam in the sunlight. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS395
00:43:07,00 --> 00:43:12,50
SOMEONE's<Tracy's> lips part longingly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS396
00:43:10,00 --> 00:43:15,50
SOMEONE notices his odd expression 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS397
00:43:12,00 --> 00:43:16,50
and follows his gaze to the wing. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS398
00:43:19,00 --> 00:43:23,50
He watches the wide-eyed case worker. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS399
00:43:21,00 --> 00:43:25,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> blinks out of the moment. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS400
00:43:23,00 --> 00:43:29,50
He meets SOMEONE's gaze, then sheepishly sips from his cup 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS401
00:43:36,00 --> 00:43:43,50
As time passes, the break room grows emptier and emptier until only SOMEONE<Derek> remains. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS402
00:43:40,00 --> 00:43:47,50
His mouth hangs open as he lies across two chairs and sleeps. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS403
00:43:44,00 --> 00:43:49,50
His head rests on a third chair's arm. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS404
00:43:49,00 --> 00:43:53,50
He picks up his phone and reads a text "Assignment cancelled. " 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS407
00:43:55,00 --> 00:43:59,50
SOMEONE<Carly> honks her horn. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS408
00:43:57,00 --> 00:44:01,50
SOMEONE<Derek> steps onto his balcony. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS409
00:44:25,00 --> 00:44:29,50
SOMEONE<Derek> lifts his brow. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS410
00:44:26,00 --> 00:44:31,50
As SOMEONE gets out with a scowl, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS411
00:44:28,00 --> 00:44:33,50
his mother sweetly mouths the word "Please". 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS412
00:44:30,00 --> 00:44:36,50
SOMEONE<Derek> forces a delighted crinkle of his nose. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS413
00:44:40,00 --> 00:44:45,50
SOMEONE<Randy> trudges toward the apartment. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS414
00:44:44,00 --> 00:44:50,50
With a sarcastic smile, SOMEONE<Derek> heads inside. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS415
00:44:47,00 --> 00:44:53,50
SOMEONE wears his earphones as he steps into the living room, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS416
00:44:50,00 --> 00:44:55,50
his hands shoved in his pockets. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS417
00:44:52,00 --> 00:44:56,50
SOMEONE<Derek> faces. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS419
00:44:56,00 --> 00:45:00,50
Shaking his head, SOMEONE<Randy> takes out his earphones. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS420
00:44:58,00 --> 00:45:04,50
He scans the room, noting SOMEONE's<Derek's> hockey paraphernalia and average apartment, then sneers. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS423
00:45:08,00 --> 00:45:14,50
Looking away impatiently, SOMEONE<Derek> sets his hands on his hips. He turns back to SOMEONE<Randy>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS424
00:45:14,00 --> 00:45:21,50
Later, he and SOMEONE<Derek> stroll through the guitar section of a music store. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS425
00:45:26,00 --> 00:45:30,50
SOMEONE<Derek> picks up a guitar. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS426
00:45:28,00 --> 00:45:32,50
He plugs it into an amp. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS427
00:45:32,00 --> 00:45:37,50
He thrusts the electric guitar into SOMEONE's<Randy's> hands. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS428
00:45:35,00 --> 00:45:41,50
The boy grudgingly plops down on a stool and glowers up at SOMEONE<Derek>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS429
00:45:48,00 --> 00:45:54,50
He rolls his eyes as he leaves SOMEONE<Randy> by himself. The boy watches SOMEONE walk away. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS431
00:45:53,00 --> 00:45:57,50
He adjusts the guitar in his hands. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS432
00:45:59,00 --> 00:46:04,50
A dark-haired girl rounds a corner and spots SOMEONE<Randy>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS433
00:46:02,00 --> 00:46:08,50
As he continues to riff, his head down, she approaches. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS434
00:46:16,00 --> 00:46:20,50
A boy walks over. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS435
00:46:22,00 --> 00:46:26,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> smiles at SOMEONE<Randy>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS436
00:46:24,00 --> 00:46:28,50
He waves bashfully. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS437
00:46:25,00 --> 00:46:30,50
As she leaves, SOMEONE<Ben> steps closer. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS438
00:46:30,00 --> 00:46:34,50
SOMEONE<Ben> grabs the guitar. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS439
00:46:33,00 --> 00:46:39,50
SOMEONE<Derek> arrives and taps SOMEONE's<Ben's> head with drumsticks. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS440
00:46:42,00 --> 00:46:47,50
SOMEONE<Ben> fearfully hands the guitar back to SOMEONE<Randy>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS441
00:46:47,00 --> 00:46:52,50
SOMEONE<Randy> watches as SOMEONE<Ben> scurries away. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS442
00:46:49,00 --> 00:46:54,50
SOMEONE<Derek> grins and SOMEONE<Randy> does too. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS443
00:46:52,00 --> 00:46:59,50
Later, in SOMEONE's<Derek's> living room, they play cards and use cheese puffs as betting chips. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS444
00:47:04,00 --> 00:47:08,50
SOMEONE<Randy> bets. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS445
00:47:14,00 --> 00:47:18,50
SOMEONE<Randy> sets down his hand. SOMEONE collects his winnings. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS446
00:47:25,00 --> 00:47:30,50
He tilts his head at SOMEONE. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS447
00:47:29,00 --> 00:47:35,50
SOMEONE<Derek> stops organizing the cards and meets SOMEONE's<Randy's> gaze. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS448
00:47:33,00 --> 00:47:37,50
The boy lifts his brow expectantly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS449
00:47:58,00 --> 00:48:02,50
SOMEONE<Derek> holds out his fist. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS451
00:48:01,00 --> 00:48:05,50
SOMEONE<Randy> eyes it, then pounds his fist to SOMEONE's<Derek's>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS452
00:48:57,00 --> 00:49:02,50
He and SOMEONE<Tess> share a grin. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS453
00:49:02,00 --> 00:49:06,50
SOMEONE's<Derek's> phone vibrates. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS456
00:49:20,00 --> 00:49:24,50
He escorts them outside. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS457
00:49:21,00 --> 00:49:25,50
Later, with SOMEONE<Tracy>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS458
00:49:46,00 --> 00:49:51,50
SOMEONE<Derek> closes his eyes as he sprays. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS459
00:49:48,00 --> 00:49:53,50
Mist shoots away from him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS460
00:49:50,00 --> 00:49:55,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> turns the nozzle to face SOMEONE<Derek>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS461
00:49:54,00 --> 00:49:58,50
SOMEONE<Derek> opens his eyes and glares at SOMEONE<Tracy>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS462
00:49:56,00 --> 00:50:00,50
He closes them again and sprays. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS463
00:49:58,00 --> 00:50:03,50
A could of mist wafts over him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS464
00:50:00,00 --> 00:50:04,50
SOMEONE<Derek> inspects himself. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS465
00:50:07,00 --> 00:50:11,50
He disappears. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS466
00:50:12,00 --> 00:50:19,50
Now, SOMEONE's<Derek's> footprints appear on a carpet as he steps into a den. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS467
00:50:16,00 --> 00:50:20,50
A couple reads on a couch. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS468
00:50:17,00 --> 00:50:22,50
The woman looks up as a rocking seems 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS469
00:50:20,00 --> 00:50:25,50
to move by itself and a lamp tips. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS470
00:50:25,00 --> 00:50:30,50
SOMEONE<Derek> steps on a plush toy. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS471
00:50:36,00 --> 00:50:41,50
Amnesia dust whirls in the air. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS472
00:50:42,00 --> 00:50:48,50
SOMEONE<Derek> fumbles the powder onto the coffee table. The woman faints. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS473
00:50:49,00 --> 00:50:54,50
At the front door, SOMEONE<Derek> faces a small dog. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS474
00:50:56,00 --> 00:51:02,50
At headquarters, the dog dangles from SOMEONE's<Derek's> wing by its teeth. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS475
00:51:08,00 --> 00:51:13,50
Two fairy assistant go to grab the dog. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS476
00:51:11,00 --> 00:51:17,50
His wing freed, SOMEONE<Derek> gives his boss the tooth. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS477
00:51:14,00 --> 00:51:19,50
He offers a sarcastic salute, then heads out. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS478
00:52:25,00 --> 00:52:29,50
Fairy Godmother's jaw hangs slack. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS479
00:52:27,00 --> 00:52:30,50
SOMEONE<Derek> grins. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS480
00:52:35,00 --> 00:52:40,50
He storms out into a corridor. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS481
00:52:40,00 --> 00:52:46,50
A cagey fairy waits for him as he passes through a doorway. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS482
00:52:45,00 --> 00:52:49,50
The cagey fairy waves him over. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS483
00:52:47,00 --> 00:52:52,50
SOMEONE<Derek> points quizzically at himself and the fairy nods. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS484
00:52:51,00 --> 00:52:56,50
He opens a display pouch and shows magic supplies. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS485
00:53:11,00 --> 00:53:15,50
SOMEONE<Derek> knits his brow. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS486
00:53:21,00 --> 00:53:25,50
He glances toward his boss. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS487
00:53:25,00 --> 00:53:29,50
He leans toward Ziggy. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS488
00:53:32,00 --> 00:53:37,50
SOMEONE<Derek> frowns and glances back at Fairy Godmother's office. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS490
00:53:36,00 --> 00:53:42,50
In front of a house, SOMEONE<Derek> sprays himself down. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS491
00:53:39,00 --> 00:53:44,50
He turns see through but doesn't disappear. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS492
00:53:41,00 --> 00:53:47,50
A woman sees his ghostly form on her way out. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS493
00:53:45,00 --> 00:53:50,50
SOMEONE<Derek> examines his transparent hands. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS494
00:53:50,00 --> 00:53:54,50
The terrified woman gapes. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS495
00:53:55,00 --> 00:54:00,50
SOMEONE<Derek> eats some shrinking paste. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS496
00:53:58,00 --> 00:54:03,50
Smacking his lips, he goes back to normal. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS497
00:54:00,00 --> 00:54:12,50
The woman's chin trembles fearfully. Instead of shrinking, SOMEONE's<Derek's> head stretches like a balloon. His ears spring out as his head grows too big for his body. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS498
00:54:14,00 --> 00:54:19,50
The fairy's head returns to the right size. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS499
00:54:19,00 --> 00:54:23,50
The woman uses her phone. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS500
00:54:22,00 --> 00:54:31,50
Later, police cruisers surround the house. Now, SOMEONE<Derek> sits in a police department holding cell with four other detainees. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS501
00:54:29,00 --> 00:54:33,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> appears in front of him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS502
00:54:46,00 --> 00:54:50,50
The others can't see SOMEONE<Tracy>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS503
00:54:51,00 --> 00:54:54,50
SOMEONE<Derek> frowns. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS504
00:55:31,00 --> 00:55:35,50
SOMEONE<Derek> frowns. The others stare. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS505
00:55:32,00 --> 00:55:37,50
Later, SOMEONE<Carly> walks SOMEONE<Derek> out. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS506
00:55:47,00 --> 00:55:51,50
They halt near the front desk. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS507
00:55:53,00 --> 00:55:57,50
SOMEONE<Derek> winces helplessly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS508
00:55:57,00 --> 00:56:01,50
SOMEONE<Carly> narrows her eye. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS509
00:56:15,00 --> 00:56:22,50
The clerk at the desk watches as SOMEONE<Derek> tosses a pinch of amnesia dust in SOMEONE's<Carly's> face. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS510
00:56:28,00 --> 00:56:33,50
He throws more dust at her. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS511
00:56:38,00 --> 00:56:44,50
SOMEONE<Derek> dashes her with more dust and the clerk gawks. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS512
00:56:51,00 --> 00:56:56,50
SOMEONE<Carly> kisses SOMEONE<Derek>, then gives him a hug. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS513
00:56:59,00 --> 00:57:03,50
The clerk scoffs. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS514
00:57:02,00 --> 00:57:06,50
In SOMEONE's<Derek's> apartment. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS515
00:57:20,00 --> 00:57:27,50
SOMEONE<Derek> wears his helmet and hockey pads over his tooth fairy uniform. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS516
00:57:31,00 --> 00:57:36,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> arches his brows doubtfully. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS517
00:57:33,00 --> 00:57:43,50
Later outside, SOMEONE<Derek> runs up to a tall concrete fence, hooks his hockey stick over the top, and vaults over it. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS518
00:57:44,00 --> 00:57:49,50
Now, the door to a young boy's room swings open 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS519
00:57:46,00 --> 00:57:51,50
and a shadowy figure strides in. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS520
00:57:48,00 --> 00:57:54,50
It's a mousy-looking father in a sweater vest. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS521
00:57:51,00 --> 00:57:57,50
He moseys over to the bed and reaches under his son's pillow. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS522
00:57:54,00 --> 00:57:58,50
As he extracts a tooth, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS523
00:57:55,00 --> 00:58:00,50
SOMEONE<Derek> treads up behind him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS524
00:57:57,00 --> 00:58:04,50
The father turns and his jaw drops. SOMEONE<Derek> covers his face with his gloved hand. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS525
00:58:14,00 --> 00:58:19,50
He lowers his glove from the man's gaping mouth. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS526
00:58:17,00 --> 00:58:22,50
He turns his hand palm up demandingly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS527
00:58:23,00 --> 00:58:28,50
The father moves his hand toward SOMEONE's<Derek's>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS529
00:58:31,00 --> 00:58:35,50
SOMEONE<Derek> nods. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS530
00:58:37,00 --> 00:58:41,50
The dumbfounded father blinks his wide eyes. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS532
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:44,50
SOMEONE<Derek> grins and strides onto a balcony. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS533
00:58:43,00 --> 00:58:49,50
He halts just outside and the father steps closer. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS534
00:58:47,00 --> 00:58:52,50
SOMEONE<Derek> props his hands on his hips. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS535
00:58:51,00 --> 00:58:56,50
The father gawks disbelievingly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS536
00:58:54,00 --> 00:59:00,50
SOMEONE<Derek> climbs over the railing and jumps off the balcony. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS540
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:15,50
SOMEONE<Derek> looks on. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS541
00:59:31,00 --> 00:59:35,50
During a game. A fight breaks out.  

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS543
01:00:01,00 --> 01:00:09,50
Alone in the locker room, SOMEONE<Derek> douses himself with invisibility spray and grins. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS544
01:00:09,00 --> 01:00:14,50
He fades completely from view. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS545
01:00:11,00 --> 01:00:20,50
Later, a door to the rink opens. Two lines carve onto the ice as the invisible SOMEONE<Derek> skates out. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS546
01:00:20,00 --> 01:00:25,50
The lines stop right behind SOMEONE<Mick>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS547
01:00:24,00 --> 01:00:28,50
The ref drops the puck. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS548
01:00:25,00 --> 01:00:31,50
SOMEONE<Mick> pumps with his skates but stays in place. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS549
01:00:32,00 --> 01:00:37,50
Finally free, SOMEONE<Mick> chases after the puck. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS550
01:00:41,00 --> 01:00:46,50
Without warning, SOMEONE<Mick> gets thrown backward. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS552
01:00:53,00 --> 01:01:00,50
Now, the star player's jersey stirs under his arms as he's tickled. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS553
01:01:02,00 --> 01:01:12,50
A peppermint embossed with a dog bone floats through midair and flies into SOMEONE's<Mick's> mouth. As he gulps it down, a ref skates up. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS554
01:01:14,00 --> 01:01:18,50
SOMEONE<Mick> grabs his throat. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS555
01:01:21,00 --> 01:01:24,50
SOMEONE<Mick> snarls. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS556
01:01:23,00 --> 01:01:27,50
The visible SOMEONE exits 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS557
01:01:24,00 --> 01:01:28,50
the locker room. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS558
01:01:25,00 --> 01:01:30,50
SOMEONE returns to the bench and takes a seat, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS559
01:01:33,00 --> 01:01:40,50
taps his throat and shudders, then shrugs. A teammate elbows him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS560
01:01:38,00 --> 01:01:45,50
SOMEONE<Mick> bumps him angrily and strokes his throat, then hunches over and pants. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS561
01:01:44,00 --> 01:01:48,50
SOMEONE<Derek> beams. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS563
01:01:46,00 --> 01:01:51,50
As SOMEONE<Derek> plays drums, SOMEONE<Randy> plays his guitar. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS564
01:02:13,00 --> 01:02:19,50
SOMEONE's<Derek's> stunned lips part as SOMEONE<Randy> sneers expectantly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS565
01:02:17,00 --> 01:02:21,50
The hockey player locks eyes with him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS566
01:02:43,00 --> 01:02:48,50
The burly man swallows and shakes his head. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS567
01:02:47,00 --> 01:02:51,50
SOMEONE<Randy> blinks thoughtfully. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS568
01:02:49,00 --> 01:02:53,50
SOMEONE<Derek> points at him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS569
01:03:10,00 --> 01:03:14,50
The player eyes the boy sheepishly, then smiles. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS572
01:03:20,00 --> 01:03:24,50
SOMEONE<Randy> drops his gaze and works his lips. He nods. They share a chuckle. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS574
01:03:28,00 --> 01:03:33,50
Now, at tooth fairy headquarters, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS575
01:03:30,00 --> 01:03:37,50
SOMEONE<Derek> saunters into SOMEONE's<Lily's> office. He wears his hockey pads and fairy uniform. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS576
01:03:36,00 --> 01:03:45,50
He presents her with a tooth box and leaves. SOMEONE<Tracy> smiles. As SOMEONE<Lily> gives a stunned look, he shrugs modestly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS578
01:03:43,00 --> 01:03:47,50
In the grand hall. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS579
01:04:26,00 --> 01:04:31,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Tracy> sprints. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS580
01:04:29,00 --> 01:04:33,50
He weaves through an obstacle course. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS581
01:04:31,00 --> 01:04:38,50
In the empty ice rink, SOMEONE<Derek> practices but falls. Now, he and SOMEONE<Randy> play music. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS582
01:04:35,00 --> 01:04:41,50
Outside, SOMEONE<Tracy> runs away from the obstacle course. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS583
01:04:40,00 --> 01:04:45,50
On the ice, SOMEONE<Derek> wipes out. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS584
01:04:42,00 --> 01:04:46,50
Back at the obstacle course. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS585
01:04:48,00 --> 01:04:54,50
At the rink, SOMEONE<Derek> shoots pucks at the net. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS586
01:04:51,00 --> 01:04:58,50
At the obstacle course, a flat cutout of a cartoony bulldog pops up. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS587
01:04:56,00 --> 01:05:01,50
Another cutout shows a child. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS588
01:04:58,00 --> 01:05:03,50
Now, SOMEONE<Derek> skates, then plays music with SOMEONE<Randy>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS589
01:05:00,00 --> 01:05:05,50
At the obstacle course, SOMEONE<Tracy> hurdles a fence. His ankles graze the top and he falls. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS591
01:05:10,00 --> 01:05:14,50
Later, SOMEONE<Derek> skates nimbly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS592
01:05:11,00 --> 01:05:17,50
At the obstacle course, cutouts showing a family pop up. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS593
01:05:14,00 --> 01:05:18,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> beheads one. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS594
01:05:19,00 --> 01:05:25,50
He smacks into an arch holding up a fake bedroom window. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS595
01:05:22,00 --> 01:05:27,50
Later, he climbs up SOMEONE<Derek> to reach it. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS596
01:05:25,00 --> 01:05:29,50
He pokes partway through. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS597
01:05:29,00 --> 01:05:34,50
With a shove from SOMEONE<Derek>, he flops through and hits the ground. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS598
01:05:32,00 --> 01:05:38,50
Now, SOMEONE<Carly> and SOMEONE<Tess> dance as SOMEONE<Derek> and SOMEONE<Randy> play their instruments. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS599
01:05:35,00 --> 01:05:41,50
Now, SOMEONE<Tracy> minces around traffic cones. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS600
01:05:42,00 --> 01:05:47,50
Later, SOMEONE<Derek> demonstrates invisibility spray. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS601
01:05:46,00 --> 01:05:50,50
They face the parent cutouts. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS602
01:05:49,00 --> 01:05:56,50
At the rink, SOMEONE<Derek> works a puck around a simple dummy consisting of two feet and a stick. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS603
01:05:53,00 --> 01:06:00,50
Observing, SOMEONE<Randy> beams. Now, SOMEONE<Derek> fires puck after puck into the net. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS604
01:05:57,00 --> 01:06:05,50
An awed SOMEONE<Randy> watches from the bench. SOMEONE<Derek> shoots the last puck and pumps a fist. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS605
01:06:05,00 --> 01:06:15,50
At the obstacle course, SOMEONE<Tracy> mimes using invisibility spray then amnesia dust. He climbs up the staged window and shows a prop tooth. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS606
01:06:12,00 --> 01:06:17,50
Later, SOMEONE<Derek> and SOMEONE<Randy> finish music practice. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS607
01:06:19,00 --> 01:06:23,50
They share a smile. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS608
01:06:24,00 --> 01:06:28,50
SOMEONE<Randy> shows a flyer for the talent show. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS609
01:06:26,00 --> 01:06:31,50
It lists the performers names with SOMEONE's<Randy's> at the bottom. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS610
01:06:45,00 --> 01:06:50,50
SOMEONE<Derek> folds the flyer and sets it aside. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS611
01:07:07,00 --> 01:07:12,50
SOMEONE<Randy> nods, stifling an eager smile. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS612
01:07:09,00 --> 01:07:14,50
SOMEONE's<Derek's> mouth stutters, then relaxes. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS613
01:07:12,00 --> 01:07:15,50
SOMEONE<Randy> grins. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS614
01:07:22,00 --> 01:07:26,50
SOMEONE<Derek> gives an encouraging smile. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS615
01:07:24,00 --> 01:07:29,50
Now, at a hockey game. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS616
01:07:33,00 --> 01:07:37,50
On the bench. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS617
01:07:51,00 --> 01:07:56,50
As SOMEONE<Mick> skates out, SOMEONE<Derek> checks the scoreboard. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS618
01:07:58,00 --> 01:08:03,50
A teammate returns to the bench and SOMEONE<Derek> skates out. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS619
01:08:03,00 --> 01:08:09,50
He ducks down and checks an arrow then hurls the player on his back. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS620
01:08:07,00 --> 01:08:11,50
The arrow crashes down onto the ice. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS621
01:08:47,00 --> 01:08:52,50
SOMEONE<Derek> hesitates, his stick raised and the puck at his feet. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS622
01:08:51,00 --> 01:08:56,50
An arrow bashes him away from the puck, knocking him down. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS623
01:08:57,00 --> 01:09:04,50
As SOMEONE<Mick> irritably shakes his head, SOMEONE<Derek> pushes himself onto his hands and knees. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS624
01:09:07,00 --> 01:09:11,50
SOMEONE<Derek> hangs his head. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS625
01:09:12,00 --> 01:09:20,50
Behind the Ice Wolves bench, the coach angrily chews his gum and glares at SOMEONE<Derek>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS626
01:09:17,00 --> 01:09:24,50
The burly player returns to the bench and takes a seat, his gaze downcast. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS627
01:09:21,00 --> 01:09:28,50
His coach swaggers closer and averts his eyes, then whirls to face SOMEONE<Derek>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS628
01:09:30,00 --> 01:09:34,50
SOMEONE<Derek> shakes his head. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS630
01:09:43,00 --> 01:09:48,50
Later, SOMEONE<Derek> drives home. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS631
01:09:45,00 --> 01:09:50,50
He finds SOMEONE<Carly> and the kids waiting in the parking lot. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS632
01:09:50,00 --> 01:09:56,50
He musters a curt wave and pulls into a parking space. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS633
01:09:54,00 --> 01:09:59,50
SOMEONE<Carly> and SOMEONE<Tess> tango toward his bumper. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS634
01:09:56,00 --> 01:10:01,50
SOMEONE<Randy> totes his guitar. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS635
01:09:59,00 --> 01:10:03,50
SOMEONE<Derek> gets out with his duffel. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS636
01:10:37,00 --> 01:10:43,50
Cringing tearfully, SOMEONE<Randy> smashes his guitar on the pavement. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS637
01:10:41,00 --> 01:10:47,50
SOMEONE<Carly> and SOMEONE<Tess> clutch their hands to their mouths. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS638
01:10:44,00 --> 01:10:51,50
SOMEONE<Randy> faces SOMEONE<Derek> and shakes his head, then collects the pieces of his guitar. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS639
01:11:01,00 --> 01:11:05,50
SOMEONE<Carly> storms to her car. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS640
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:13,50
SOMEONE<Derek> stands frozen. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS641
01:11:11,00 --> 01:11:15,50
SOMEONE<Carly> stifles tears. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS642
01:11:14,00 --> 01:11:20,50
She tugs open her car door and gets behind the wheel. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS643
01:11:20,00 --> 01:11:25,50
SOMEONE<Carly> jerks her head and drives off. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS644
01:11:22,00 --> 01:11:27,50
SOMEONE squeezes his eyes shut, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS645
01:11:24,00 --> 01:11:30,50
then regretfully shakes his head and summons a sorrowful breath. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS646
01:11:27,00 --> 01:11:31,50
Fade to black. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS647
01:11:33,00 --> 01:11:38,50
Now in bed, he wakes up. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS648
01:11:38,00 --> 01:11:43,50
He staggers to his front door. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS649
01:11:44,00 --> 01:11:49,50
Opening up, he finds SOMEONE<Tracy> outside. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS650
01:11:52,00 --> 01:11:55,50
Later, upstairs. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS651
01:11:55,00 --> 01:12:01,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> shows a fairy learner's permit with his photo on it. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS652
01:12:21,00 --> 01:12:25,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> shifts uncomfortably. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS653
01:12:53,00 --> 01:12:59,50
SOMEONE<Derek> throws a hand toward the floor in a falling motion. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS654
01:12:56,00 --> 01:13:01,50
SOMEONE eyes the spot sadly, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS655
01:12:58,00 --> 01:13:03,50
then purses his lips. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS656
01:13:00,00 --> 01:13:04,50
He and SOMEONE<Derek> lock gazes. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS657
01:13:16,00 --> 01:13:22,50
The case worker gives a mocking sneer and disappears in thin air. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS659
01:13:44,00 --> 01:13:48,50
At a game, a ref drops the puck. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS660
01:13:47,00 --> 01:13:52,50
Two players crash into each other. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS661
01:13:57,00 --> 01:14:03,50
An opposing player blocks SOMEONE<Mick> as he tries to weave around. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS662
01:14:11,00 --> 01:14:16,50
The puck bounces off the net's frame. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS663
01:14:14,00 --> 01:14:19,50
An opponent bashes SOMEONE<Petrenko> in the back. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS664
01:14:24,00 --> 01:14:30,50
SOMEONE<Petrenko> writhes face down on the ice. A SOMEONE<medic> skates out. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS665
01:14:27,00 --> 01:14:34,50
Behind the bench, the Ice Wolves' coach scowls, then sidles over to SOMEONE<Derek>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS666
01:14:35,00 --> 01:14:39,50
SOMEONE<Derek> eyes him quizzically. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS667
01:14:38,00 --> 01:14:42,50
The coach glares, then stalks away. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS668
01:14:40,00 --> 01:14:45,50
Straightening out of a slouch, SOMEONE<Derek> grabs his helmet. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS669
01:14:43,00 --> 01:14:50,50
In the stands, the NHL hopeful, SOMEONE<Gabe>, watches anxiously as SOMEONE<Derek> heads onto the ice. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS670
01:14:53,00 --> 01:14:58,50
SOMEONE<Derek> lumbers onto the ice. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS671
01:15:05,00 --> 01:15:10,50
An opposing team member knocks him down. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS672
01:15:12,00 --> 01:15:19,50
SOMEONE<Derek> slides into the rink wall under the opposing team's box. His rivals bang their sticks. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS673
01:15:21,00 --> 01:15:27,50
SOMEONE<Derek> wearily pushes himself up onto all fours. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS674
01:15:25,00 --> 01:15:33,50
As he sits back, he sees two opposing players skate past with smug stares. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS675
01:15:32,00 --> 01:15:38,50
Their teammates on the bench jeer at SOMEONE<Derek> as he gets to his feet. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS676
01:15:41,00 --> 01:15:50,50
At the Ice Wolves' bench, the coach shouts impatiently. His teammates pound the wall with their gloved hands. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS677
01:15:48,00 --> 01:15:54,50
SOMEONE's<Derek's> hopeless gaze sweeps over the ice rink. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS678
01:15:51,00 --> 01:15:57,50
He spots SOMEONE<Tracy> perched on a goal's crossbar. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS680
01:15:56,00 --> 01:16:01,50
Unseen by the rival goalie, SOMEONE<Tracy> watches SOMEONE<Derek> steadily. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS681
01:15:58,00 --> 01:16:03,50
As the discouraged athlete meets his gaze, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS682
01:16:00,00 --> 01:16:06,50
the case worker jerks his head toward the rink. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS683
01:16:03,00 --> 01:16:07,50
SOMEONE's<Derek's> eyes narrow. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS685
01:16:05,00 --> 01:16:11,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> repeats the encouraging gesture and gives a nod. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS686
01:16:08,00 --> 01:16:14,50
The athlete looks away, his chest heaving. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS689
01:16:14,00 --> 01:16:19,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> brightly lifts his brow and cocks his head. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS691
01:16:19,00 --> 01:16:25,50
His gaze growing determined, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS692
01:16:22,00 --> 01:16:29,50
SOMEONE<Derek> heaves a resolute sigh and bravely leaves the wall. SOMEONE's<Tracy's> smile grows as the athlete skates out with an invigorated stride. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS693
01:16:33,00 --> 01:16:37,50
He rushes an opponent. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS694
01:16:41,00 --> 01:16:46,50
Stopping short, he intercepts the puck. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS695
01:16:58,00 --> 01:17:02,50
SOMEONE<Gabe> stares slack-jawed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS696
01:17:01,00 --> 01:17:06,50
The defender smacks him with his stick. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS697
01:17:09,00 --> 01:17:15,50
Leaping, SOMEONE<Derek> flings the puck with his stick. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS698
01:17:13,00 --> 01:17:19,50
He lands on his stomach and slides. The puck flies into the net. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS699
01:17:18,00 --> 01:17:25,50
His teammates cheer and SOMEONE's<Gabe's> dad lifts the boy in his arms. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS700
01:17:26,00 --> 01:17:35,50
As the fans whoop, SOMEONE<Mick> and another teammate shout joyfully. Their coach folds his arms, shakes his head, and allows a smile. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS701
01:17:33,00 --> 01:17:39,50
SOMEONE<Derek> stands and raises his arms. His teammates join him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS702
01:17:50,00 --> 01:17:55,50
SOMEONE<Derek> and his teammates skate across the ice. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS703
01:17:54,00 --> 01:17:58,50
He faces SOMEONE<Mick>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS704
01:17:57,00 --> 01:18:05,50
SOMEONE<Derek> gives a crooked smile and pumps his fist. With a warm smirk, SOMEONE<Mick> sits back on the bench. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS705
01:18:05,00 --> 01:18:12,50
SOMEONE<Derek> reaches the center line with his teammates and exhales through pursed lips. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS706
01:18:17,00 --> 01:18:27,50
SOMEONE<Derek> spots SOMEONE<Tracy> by the bench tapping his watch. As the athlete stares, the case worker stubbornly points at his timepiece. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS707
01:18:26,00 --> 01:18:32,50
He shifts his conflicted gaze and crouches slightly, his stick ready. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS708
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:33,50
The play begins. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS709
01:18:39,00 --> 01:18:43,50
He faces SOMEONE<Tracy>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS710
01:18:57,00 --> 01:19:03,50
The scoreboard LED screens flash an address. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS711
01:19:00,00 --> 01:19:05,50
2122 Pine Street. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS712
01:19:02,00 --> 01:19:07,50
SOMEONE<Derek> soberly faces SOMEONE<Tracy>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS713
01:19:16,00 --> 01:19:20,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> gives a patient shrug. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS714
01:19:19,00 --> 01:19:25,50
The case worker's lips curl upward in a smile. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS715
01:19:22,00 --> 01:19:27,50
SOMEONE's<Derek's> wings sprout from his back. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS716
01:19:24,00 --> 01:19:29,50
His coach and teammates stare wide-eyed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS717
01:19:26,00 --> 01:19:32,50
In the stands, SOMEONE<Gabe> blinks at his favorite player. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS718
01:19:29,00 --> 01:19:36,50
SOMEONE<Derek> drops his stick, shakes off his gloves, and removes his helmet. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS719
01:19:33,00 --> 01:19:40,50
His brow lifted, he eyes the people filling the stands all around him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS720
01:19:37,00 --> 01:19:43,50
SOMEONE<Derek> yields a stoic shrug and faces his case worker. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS722
01:19:51,00 --> 01:20:02,50
With a brilliant flash of light, SOMEONE's<Derek's> hockey uniform vanishes, leaving him clad in his satiny tunic and tights. His coach and teammates gape. SOMEONE flashes a self-conscious smirk. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS724
01:20:03,00 --> 01:20:10,50
He skates a broad, graceful arc around the rink as the crowd watches breathlessly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS725
01:20:11,00 --> 01:20:16,50
SOMEONE<Derek> makes another turn and gathers speed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS726
01:20:13,00 --> 01:20:21,50
He smiles at his benched teammates as he passes and they respond with slack-jawed stares. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS727
01:20:18,00 --> 01:20:23,50
Beside them, SOMEONE<Tracy> looks on proudly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS728
01:20:21,00 --> 01:20:29,50
In slow motion, SOMEONE's<Derek's> wings give a powerful flap and his skates lift off the ice. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS729
01:20:27,00 --> 01:20:34,50
The winged man extends his arms straight by his sides and flies over us. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS730
01:20:31,00 --> 01:20:37,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> grins, tilting his head back to watch. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS731
01:20:34,00 --> 01:20:39,50
SOMEONE's<Derek's> teammates and fans get to their feet. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS732
01:20:36,00 --> 01:20:42,50
The coach's chewing gum balances on his slack lip. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS733
01:20:39,00 --> 01:20:45,50
In the stands, SOMEONE<Gabe> stands on his chair. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS734
01:20:44,00 --> 01:20:51,50
From overhead, we watch SOMEONE<Derek> ascend toward us with a wide-eyed smile. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS735
01:20:48,00 --> 01:20:57,50
As SOMEONE<Gabe> watches soberly, a sparkling swirling vortex opens just beneath the ceiling. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS736
01:20:54,00 --> 01:21:03,50
The announcers gawk as SOMEONE<Derek> flies toward the vortex then vanishes inside it with a flash of light. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS737
01:21:00,00 --> 01:21:08,50
Below, his teammates and fans stare after him and the players on the ice stand motionless. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS738
01:21:05,00 --> 01:21:13,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> rides out atop a zamboni mounted with a sleek gleaming cannon. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS739
01:21:18,00 --> 01:21:24,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> swivels the gun as it shoots a thick jet of amnesia dust. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS741
01:21:36,00 --> 01:21:40,50
As SOMEONE<Tess> sleeps soundly in her bed, SOMEONE's<Derek's> hand reaches under her pillow. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS742
01:21:38,00 --> 01:21:43,50
He removes a tiny envelope sealed with a smiley face sticker. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS743
01:21:41,00 --> 01:21:47,50
SOMEONE beams fondly at it, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS745
01:21:46,00 --> 01:21:52,50
then slides a rolled up SOMEONE<bill> under the pillow. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS746
01:21:50,00 --> 01:21:58,50
The winged man leans forward, resting his elbows the side of Tess' bed as he gazes tenderly at her. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS747
01:21:58,00 --> 01:22:02,50
She awakens and smiles. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS748
01:22:01,00 --> 01:22:04,50
She sits up. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS749
01:22:06,00 --> 01:22:11,50
She notices his broad wing. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS750
01:22:20,00 --> 01:22:24,50
SOMEONE<Tess> pats his cheek. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS751
01:22:26,00 --> 01:22:30,50
SOMEONE<Tess> blinks sweetly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS753
01:22:34,00 --> 01:22:40,50
SOMEONE<Derek> smiles gently, then sprinkles a ring of glowing sparkly dust between them. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS754
01:22:39,00 --> 01:22:44,50
SOMEONE looks up at the hovering wreath 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS755
01:22:41,00 --> 01:22:45,50
and SOMEONE<Derek> grins at her. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS756
01:22:42,00 --> 01:22:48,50
Meeting his gaze, she beams joyfully. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS757
01:22:52,00 --> 01:22:55,50
They share a smile. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS758
01:22:53,00 --> 01:22:58,50
The little girl gazes up at the shimmering dust. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS761
01:23:02,00 --> 01:23:07,50
SOMEONE<Derek> creeps downstairs and ducks around a corner, leaving SOMEONE<Carly> undisturbed on the sofa, sound asleep. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS762
01:23:05,00 --> 01:23:10,50
She doses under an afghan, a work document by her side. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS764
01:23:09,00 --> 01:23:14,50
In his room, SOMEONE<Randy> lies on his loft bed, his back to the door and his eyes closed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS768
01:23:16,00 --> 01:23:21,50
An ear bud wire trails from SOMEONE<Derek> starts to approach, then pauses. The boy's hand rhythmically.  

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS769
01:23:18,00 --> 01:23:22,50
Taking a breath, SOMEONE tucks his wings out of sight. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS775
01:23:25,00 --> 01:23:29,50
and crosses to the bed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS778
01:23:35,00 --> 01:23:39,50
He exhales bracing, then taps the boy's elbow.  

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS779
01:23:36,00 --> 01:23:41,50
Rolling over, SOMEONE<Randy> scowls and removes his ear buds. He turns away from his visitor. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS781
01:23:53,00 --> 01:23:56,50
SOMEONE shakes his head 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS782
01:24:11,00 --> 01:24:17,50
His back still to SOMEONE's<Derek's> remorseful gaze, SOMEONE<Randy> shuts his eyes and bites his lip.  

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS785
01:24:18,00 --> 01:24:23,50
Blinking tearfully, he rolls over and props himself up on his elbows. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS787
01:24:34,00 --> 01:24:38,50
SOMEONE<Derek> shifts his sober gaze, nods, then raises a finger. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS789
01:24:38,00 --> 01:24:43,50
Crouching beneath the bed, he takes out his wand. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS790
01:24:40,00 --> 01:24:45,50
SOMEONE<Derek> shuts his eyes, shakes his head, and mutters a silent wish. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS792
01:24:44,00 --> 01:24:50,50
Opening his eyes, he flourishes the wand and sparkling light trails from its tip. SOMEONE<Derek> eyes his handiwork and grins. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS796
01:24:53,00 --> 01:24:58,50
he presents SOMEONE<Randy> with a shiny new guitar. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS798
01:25:06,00 --> 01:25:11,50
SOMEONE<Randy> sizes up SOMEONE's<Derek's> outfit. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS799
01:25:15,00 --> 01:25:19,50
SOMEONE<Randy> smiles and nods. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS800
01:25:17,00 --> 01:25:22,50
Leaving the room, SOMEONE<Derek> spreads his wings. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS801
01:25:19,00 --> 01:25:24,50
The boy's smile vanishes. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS802
01:25:21,00 --> 01:25:25,50
Now, by the stairs. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS803
01:25:23,00 --> 01:25:28,50
Turning, he finds SOMEONE<Carly> gawking. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS804
01:25:28,00 --> 01:25:34,50
SOMEONE<Tess> hurries downstairs and joins the winged man at his side. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS805
01:25:32,00 --> 01:25:37,50
SOMEONE<Carly> takes in the situation, then tilts her head. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS806
01:25:46,00 --> 01:25:51,50
As SOMEONE<Carly> grins, SOMEONE<Randy> joins them. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS807
01:25:59,00 --> 01:26:04,50
Passing SOMEONE<Derek>, SOMEONE<Carly> pauses and gives him a kiss. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS809
01:26:06,00 --> 01:26:12,50
Holding SOMEONE<Randy> close, SOMEONE<Derek> takes to the air. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS810
01:26:13,00 --> 01:26:17,50
City lights twinkle below. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS811
01:26:36,00 --> 01:26:40,50
They land in the school's parking lot. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS812
01:26:38,00 --> 01:26:45,50
As SOMEONE<Randy> grins at him, SOMEONE<Derek> lets out a breath and soberly holds the boy's gaze. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS813
01:26:43,00 --> 01:26:47,50
SOMEONE's<Randy's> smile fades. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS814
01:26:46,00 --> 01:26:51,50
SOMEONE<Derek> produces his pouch of amnesia dust. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS815
01:26:52,00 --> 01:26:56,50
The boy's lip curls questioningly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS816
01:26:54,00 --> 01:26:59,50
SOMEONE takes out a pinch of dust, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS817
01:26:56,00 --> 01:27:01,50
casts it at SOMEONE's<Randy's> face, and vanishes. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS818
01:26:59,00 --> 01:27:04,50
A school faculty member comes out and spots the 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS819
01:27:06,00 --> 01:27:10,50
Now, in SOMEONE's<Lily's> office. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS820
01:27:30,00 --> 01:27:33,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> looks on. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS821
01:27:31,00 --> 01:27:36,50
As SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE expectantly, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS822
01:27:33,00 --> 01:27:37,50
the case worker leans closer. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS823
01:27:40,00 --> 01:27:44,50
SOMEONE<Lily> gapes proudly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS824
01:27:46,00 --> 01:27:50,50
SOMEONE<Derek> offers a warm smile. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS828
01:28:00,00 --> 01:28:07,50
She sprinkles an arc of sparkling dust before him and his wings vanish. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS829
01:28:06,00 --> 01:28:10,50
She extends a hand. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS830
01:28:11,00 --> 01:28:15,50
SOMEONE<Derek> points at it. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS831
01:28:13,00 --> 01:28:19,50
Grinning, he spreads his arms and envelops her in a hug. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS832
01:28:16,00 --> 01:28:20,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> winces. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS833
01:28:34,00 --> 01:28:39,50
He hugs her again and kisses her cheek. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS834
01:28:45,00 --> 01:28:49,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> shifts anxiously. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS835
01:28:56,00 --> 01:29:01,50
SOMEONE<Lily> bestows a badge upon him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS836
01:28:59,00 --> 01:29:04,50
It's shaped like a tooth with a pair of fairy wings. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS837
01:29:01,00 --> 01:29:07,50
SOMEONE<Derek> beams as she pins it on SOMEONE's<Tracy's> vest. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS838
01:29:04,00 --> 01:29:09,50
The case worker gawks. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS839
01:29:19,00 --> 01:29:24,50
SOMEONE<Derek> hands over his supply bag. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS840
01:29:24,00 --> 01:29:31,50
He leans toward SOMEONE<Lily> with puckered lips but she gracefully recoils. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS841
01:29:31,00 --> 01:29:35,50
He offers an awkward bow. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS842
01:29:43,00 --> 01:29:47,50
She holds a small box. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS843
01:29:49,00 --> 01:29:53,50
SOMEONE's<Derek's> smile fades. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS844
01:29:57,00 --> 01:30:01,50
SOMEONE<Lily> smiles. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS845
01:29:59,00 --> 01:30:03,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> shakes his head and shrugs his hand. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS846
01:30:03,00 --> 01:30:06,50
He grins. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS847
01:30:04,00 --> 01:30:09,50
SOMEONE's<Derek's> expression grows serious and earnest. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS848
01:30:13,00 --> 01:30:16,50
The human nods. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS849
01:30:19,00 --> 01:30:24,50
The new tooth fairy gives a sad smile. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS850
01:30:26,00 --> 01:30:30,50
SOMEONE<Derek> whops him. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS851
01:30:31,00 --> 01:30:36,50
SOMEONE<Tracy> punches SOMEONE's<Derek's> shoulder twice. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS852
01:30:37,00 --> 01:30:43,50
He flings his arms around SOMEONE<Derek>, who returns the brotherly hug. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS853
01:30:54,00 --> 01:31:00,50
SOMEONE<Lily> rolls her eyes, then sprinkles SOMEONE<Derek> with amnesia dust. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS854
01:30:58,00 --> 01:31:05,50
In the talent show's packed audience, SOMEONE<Carly> anxiously looks around. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS855
01:31:02,00 --> 01:31:09,50
Seated beside her, SOMEONE<Tess> contentedly bops her shoulders to the music. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS856
01:31:06,00 --> 01:31:11,50
SOMEONE<Derek> arrives and scans the crowd. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS857
01:31:08,00 --> 01:31:13,50
Moving down the aisle, he sits beside SOMEONE<Carly>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS858
01:31:15,00 --> 01:31:20,50
He gazes off with a puzzled frown. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS859
01:31:25,00 --> 01:31:30,50
SOMEONE<Derek> winks at SOMEONE<Tess>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS860
01:31:29,00 --> 01:31:34,50
The three companions face the stage. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS861
01:31:32,00 --> 01:31:38,50
Young members of a band wave and take their bows. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS862
01:31:41,00 --> 01:31:49,50
In a white shirt and black vest, SOMEONE<Randy> comes out with his new guitar and gives a shy wave. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS864
01:31:49,00 --> 01:31:56,50
The boy arrives at center stage and raises his strumming hand to the guitar strings. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS866
01:31:54,00 --> 01:31:59,50
He pauses, facing the large packed house, and gives a modest smile. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS869
01:31:58,00 --> 01:32:03,50
Swaying on his feet, he looks down at his instrument. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS870
01:32:26,00 --> 01:32:32,50
The boy rhythmically bobs his knees and wags his head. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS871
01:32:29,00 --> 01:32:36,50
As the audience listens appreciatively, the band members peek out from backstage. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS872
01:32:35,00 --> 01:32:39,50
SOMEONE<Carly> grins broadly. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS873
01:32:37,00 --> 01:32:43,50
On stage, her son's playing grows bolder and more relaxed. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS874
01:32:40,00 --> 01:32:51,50
The band members exchange nods, then join SOMEONE<Randy> on stage. He glances up from his guitar, confidently facing the audience between phrases. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS875
01:32:51,00 --> 01:32:59,50
As he notices the other musicians, the audience members leap to their feet and the bass player smiles. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS876
01:32:56,00 --> 01:33:03,50
Dancing with SOMEONE<Tess>, SOMEONE<Carly> raises her hand high and SOMEONE<Derek> beams. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS877
01:33:01,00 --> 01:33:06,50
SOMEONE<Randy> faces the crowd with a joyful smile. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS878
01:33:03,00 --> 01:33:10,50
SOMEONE<Derek> draws SOMEONE<Carly> close and she blinks back proud tears. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS879
01:33:08,00 --> 01:33:14,50
Elsewhere in the crowd, SOMEONE<Kelly> smiles up at the guitarist. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS880
01:33:11,00 --> 01:33:18,50
Grinning, SOMEONE<Derek> points rhythmically at the boy while SOMEONE<Carly> bounces SOMEONE<Tess> in her arms. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS881
01:33:19,00 --> 01:33:27,50
SOMEONE<Randy> bites his lip in blissful concentration. As the audience grins and pumps their fists, 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS882
01:33:24,00 --> 01:33:29,50
he bounces smoothly, leaning back. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS883
01:33:26,00 --> 01:33:33,50
He wags his head, swishing his moppy hair, and his little sister beams. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS884
01:33:33,00 --> 01:33:42,50
SOMEONE<Carly> hugs SOMEONE<Tess>. Her boyfriend points at SOMEONE<Randy>, smiling warmly. The boy takes a bow and SOMEONE<Derek> gives a thumbs up. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS885
01:33:41,00 --> 01:33:45,50
SOMEONE<Carly> blows him a kiss. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS886
01:33:43,00 --> 01:33:50,50
SOMEONE<Randy> returns the gesture, then swaps friendly nods with his fellow musicians. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS887
01:33:47,00 --> 01:33:53,50
SOMEONE<Tess> grins up at him while SOMEONE<Derek> lovingly watches SOMEONE<Carly>. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS889
01:33:54,00 --> 01:34:00,50
She shares an elated smile with him, then faces the stage. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS890
01:34:00,00 --> 01:34:05,50
She stares, then rolls her head in a double take. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS891
01:34:12,00 --> 01:34:17,50
SOMEONE<Derek> gazes into her eyes. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS892
01:34:17,00 --> 01:34:22,50
Smiling tearfully, she nods. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS893
01:34:22,00 --> 01:34:27,50
They share a passionate kiss and hold each other tight. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS894
01:34:26,00 --> 01:34:32,50
Swaying with SOMEONE<Carly> in his arms, SOMEONE<Derek> spots SOMEONE<Tess> watching them. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS895
01:34:32,00 --> 01:34:37,50
Beaming, she claps her hands. 

TOOTH_FAIRY_DVS896
01:34:36,00 --> 01:34:45,50
