and the boy leads the horse into a yard. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS114

The boy lets go of the reigns 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS115
00:29:14,00 --> 00:29:19,50
and the horse bucks his head and rears up. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS117
00:29:23,00 --> 00:29:28,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> clings onto the reigns as the horse jumps about.

00:32:35,00 --> 00:32:42,50
Wearing dirty combinations, SOMEONE<Rooster> lies on the scruffy bed staring at SOMEONE<Mattie>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS124
00:32:45,00 --> 00:32:50,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> lets a smile slip. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS125
00:32:47,00 --> 00:32:52,50

TRUE_GRIT_DVS132
00:34:05,00 --> 00:34:11,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> rides along a track to a wide river with a wooden ferry. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS133
00:34:08,00 --> 00:34:15,50
The ferryman walks up and SOMEONE<Mattie> looks at two figures on the opposite bank. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS134
00:34:29,00 --> 00:34:34,50
He leads Little Blackie away. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS135
00:34:37,00 --> 00:34:44,50
She takes an apple from her bag and hurls it at the man's head. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS136
00:34:42,00 --> 00:34:47,50
Stunned, he lets go of the reigns. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS137
00:34:46,00 --> 00:34:51,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> rides back to the river.

00:34:53,00 --> 00:35:02,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> rides Little Blackie into the muddy river and they swim across, their heads just above the fast flowing water. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS142
00:35:00,00 --> 00:35:05,50
On the other side, SOMEONE is with SOMEONE, 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS143
00:35:03,00 --> 00:35:07,50
both astride their horses. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS144
00:35:04,00 --> 00:35:08,50
They causally watch as SOMEONE<Mattie> approaches. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS146
00:35:15,00 --> 00:35:21,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> and Little Blackie struggle on determinedly. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS147
00:35:19,00 --> 00:35:24,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> puts a cigarette in his mouth and lights it. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS148
00:35:30,00 --> 00:35:36,50
As they approach the riverbank, SOMEONE<Mattie> remounts Little Blackie. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS149
00:35:34,00 --> 00:35:39,50
Little Blackie snorts and wallops up the steep muddy bank, 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS150
00:35:37,00 --> 00:35:43,50
then trots onto the parched matted grass in front of SOMEONE<Rooster> and SOMEONE<LaBoeuf>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS151
00:35:44,00 --> 00:35:50,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> and SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> stare at SOMEONE<Mattie> impassively. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS152
00:35:47,00 --> 00:35:53,50
She returns their gaze, breathing heavily from her exertion. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS153
00:35:51,00 --> 00:35:59,50
Her long neat pigtails hang down over the front of her dark sodden brown coat. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS154
00:35:56,00 --> 00:36:02,50
On her head, she wears her father's wide-brimmed hat which she packed with paper to make it fit. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS157
00:36:30,00 --> 00:36:37,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> gets down from his horse and marches over to SOMEONE<Mattie>.  

TRUE_GRIT_DVS160
00:36:37,00 --> 00:36:41,50
He grabs her coat, pulls her to the ground. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS162
00:36:51,00 --> 00:36:55,50
He slaps her behind. He gets a stick.  

TRUE_GRIT_DVS163
00:36:56,00 --> 00:37:01,50
SOMEONE blows out cigarette smoke as he observes, He whips her. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS166
00:37:10,00 --> 00:37:15,50
SOMEONE pulls out his pistol, cocks it. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS167
00:37:12,00 --> 00:37:18,50
He aims at SOMEONE and stares at him fiercely. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS168
00:37:16,00 --> 00:37:21,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> stands and throws the stick away. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS169
00:37:18,00 --> 00:37:25,50
He walks towards SOMEONE<Rooster> who uncocks his weapon and holsters it. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS170
00:37:30,00 --> 00:37:37,50
In the pitch black night, SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> and SOMEONE<Mattie> sit by a campfire. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS171
00:37:34,00 --> 00:37:39,50
SOMEONE stares at the flames 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS172
00:37:36,00 --> 00:37:41,50
and SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> puffs on his pipe. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS173
00:38:02,00 --> 00:38:08,50
SOMEONE wanders over, stares at SOMEONE for a moment, 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS174
00:38:05,00 --> 00:38:10,50
then drops a pile of logs on the fire. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS175
00:38:25,00 --> 00:38:29,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> unreels some rope. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS179
00:39:28,00 --> 00:39:33,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> lies down staring at SOMEONE<LaBoeuf>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS182
00:39:56,00 --> 00:40:00,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> sips booze from a bottle. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS183
00:39:58,00 --> 00:40:02,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> frowns indignantly. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS184
00:40:00,00 --> 00:40:04,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> smiles at them both. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS186
00:40:13,00 --> 00:40:18,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> looks bewildered. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS187
00:40:15,00 --> 00:40:21,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> clasps both hands around his booze bottle. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS189
00:40:19,00 --> 00:40:24,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> lies under a blanket with her head against her saddle. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS190
00:40:24,00 --> 00:40:29,50
She wakes and sits up. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS191
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:32,50
A breeze ruffles loose strands of her hair. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS192
00:40:29,00 --> 00:40:37,50
She walks over to SOMEONE<Rooster> who's by some bare trees tying leather bags to his horse’s saddle. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS193
00:42:46,00 --> 00:42:50,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> points at SOMEONE<LaBoeuf>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS194
00:43:10,00 --> 00:43:16,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> watches, frowning as SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> rides off across the plains. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS197
00:43:27,00 --> 00:43:33,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> and SOMEONE<Rooster> ride side by side along by some rocks. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS198
00:43:30,00 --> 00:43:34,50
They head towards a wooden shack. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS199
00:43:32,00 --> 00:43:39,50
Two Native American kids sit on the porch tormenting a tied up donkey, 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS200
00:43:36,00 --> 00:43:41,50
poking it with a broom and a stick. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS201
00:43:38,00 --> 00:43:44,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> dismounts and hands his reigns to SOMEONE<Mattie>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS202
00:43:42,00 --> 00:43:47,50
He stomps over to the kids, holding a big knife. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS203
00:43:49,00 --> 00:43:54,50
He cuts the donkey's rope and sets it 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS205
00:43:53,00 --> 00:43:59,50
He grabs the kid with the broom, throws him to the ground, 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS206
00:43:56,00 --> 00:44:00,50
and whacks him with the broom. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS207
00:44:06,00 --> 00:44:13,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> boots the kid with the stick off the porch and goes into the shack. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS208
00:44:10,00 --> 00:44:15,50
A bell hands from the porch roof. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS209
00:44:12,00 --> 00:44:17,50
It has the letter B in relief on it. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS210
00:44:15,00 --> 00:44:20,50
The two kids sit staring at SOMEONE<Mattie> through narrowed eyes. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS212
00:44:20,00 --> 00:44:25,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> comes out of the shack and shoves one of the kids to the ground. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS213
00:44:34,00 --> 00:44:39,50
He flips a square of gold to SOMEONE<Mattie>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS214
00:46:20,00 --> 00:46:25,50
Surrounded by bare twisted trees, they stop. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS215
00:46:23,00 --> 00:46:31,50
Dangling from one of the upper most branches of a tree is a hanged man. A large bird pecks at the corpse’s flesh. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS217
00:46:31,00 --> 00:46:37,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> shoots his pistol in the air and the bird flies off. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS218
00:46:35,00 --> 00:46:41,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> and SOMEONE<Rooster> walk over and stand beneath the hanged man. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS219
00:46:39,00 --> 00:46:43,50
They look up. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS220
00:47:20,00 --> 00:47:26,50
High up in the tree, SOMEONE<Mattie> looks down indignantly. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS221
00:47:40,00 --> 00:47:45,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> smokes a cigarette. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS222
00:47:54,00 --> 00:47:59,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> cuts through the rope with a knife. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS223
00:48:04,00 --> 00:48:08,50
The corpse drops. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS225
00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:14,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> pushes the body onto its back with his boot. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS226
00:48:12,00 --> 00:48:17,50
He stares at the dark, deathly face framed by matted hair. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS228
00:48:23,00 --> 00:48:27,50
They both look round. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS229
00:48:25,00 --> 00:48:30,50
A man slowly approaches on horseback. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS230
00:48:28,00 --> 00:48:34,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> opens his coat revealing his pistol holstered at his side. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS231
00:48:31,00 --> 00:48:36,50
He rests his hand on it and watches the man approach. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS233
00:48:38,00 --> 00:48:43,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> looks down from high above. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS234
00:48:40,00 --> 00:48:46,50
The man stops with the body on the ground between him and SOMEONE<Rooster>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS235
00:48:54,00 --> 00:48:59,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> climbs down from the tree. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS236
00:48:56,00 --> 00:49:01,50
The man rides away with the body. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS237
00:50:10,00 --> 00:50:14,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> and SOMEONE<Rooster> stay put, sitting on their horses by some trees. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS239
00:50:14,00 --> 00:50:19,50
Snowflakes flutter around them. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS240
00:50:19,00 --> 00:50:26,50
The snow falls heavier, swirling through the air. As they continue to sit and wait, 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS241
00:50:24,00 --> 00:50:29,50
staring at dense tangled bushes 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS242
00:50:26,00 --> 00:50:31,50
and gnarled tree branches, 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS243
00:50:32,00 --> 00:50:38,50
a rider and two horses slowly approaches. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS244
00:50:35,00 --> 00:50:40,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> cocks his head, curiously. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS246
00:50:40,00 --> 00:50:45,50
The rider appears to be a black bear and the second horse has a dead body draped over it. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS247
00:50:51,00 --> 00:50:56,50
The rider stops facing SOMEONE<Rooster>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS248
00:50:54,00 --> 00:51:02,50
It is in fact a grizzled old man wearing a bear skin with the head still attached. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS249
00:51:00,00 --> 00:51:05,50
The man has a thick scraggy gray beard. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS250
00:51:02,00 --> 00:51:07,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> stares at him. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS251
00:51:26,00 --> 00:51:31,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> peers at the corpse. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS252
00:52:38,00 --> 00:52:45,50
That night, SOMEONE<Rooster> and SOMEONE<Mattie> look down at a cabin lodged into a muddy hillside. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS253
00:52:42,00 --> 00:52:47,50
Smoke wafts from a brick chimney. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS254
00:52:56,00 --> 00:53:02,50
Holding SOMEONE's coat, SOMEONE carefully walks onto the roof 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS255
00:52:59,00 --> 00:53:03,50
and over to the chimney. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS256
00:53:09,00 --> 00:53:15,50
Holding his rifle, SOMEONE<Rooster> makes his way to the front of the cabin. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS257
00:53:13,00 --> 00:53:19,50
All is dark apart from a slit of yellow light at a window. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS258
00:53:18,00 --> 00:53:21,50
The door opens. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS259
00:53:27,00 --> 00:53:31,50
They shut the door. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS260
00:53:37,00 --> 00:53:45,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> raises his hand to SOMEONE<Mattie> who puts SOMEONE's<Rooster's> coat over the chimney top, stifling the smoke. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS261
00:53:45,00 --> 00:53:53,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> squats down by some tree branches and aims at the dark cabin with his rifle. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS262
00:53:58,00 --> 00:54:05,50
Smoke seeps under the front door. SOMEONE<Mattie> carefully treads across the rooftop. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS263
00:54:07,00 --> 00:54:14,50
The men start shooting from the cabin and SOMEONE<Rooster> returns fire. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS264
00:54:43,00 --> 00:54:51,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Mattie> stares at the two scruffy, dirty men, now handcuffed. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS265
00:54:48,00 --> 00:54:59,50
The younger, Moon, has lank straggly hair and his face is covered in sweat. He holds a bloody cloth over a wound on his leg. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS266
00:54:56,00 --> 00:55:02,50
SOMEONE has a round jowly face 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS267
00:54:59,00 --> 00:55:04,50
set in a frown. SOMEONE<Rooster> stirs a pan of stew. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS269
00:55:42,00 --> 00:55:48,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> sits with a bowl of stew and smiles at SOMEONE<Quincy>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS270
00:57:31,00 --> 00:57:35,50
She looks at Moon. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS271
00:58:05,00 --> 00:58:11,50
SOMEONE<Quincy> plunges a knife into Moon's chest. SOMEONE<Rooster> shoots SOMEONE<Quincy> in the face. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS273
00:58:11,00 --> 00:58:15,50
SOMEONE<Quincy> lies dead. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS274
00:58:12,00 --> 00:58:17,50
Blood speckles cover SOMEONE's<Rooster's> cheek. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS275
00:58:15,00 --> 00:58:21,50
He looks down at Moon with a knife sticking out of his chest. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS276
00:58:21,00 --> 00:58:28,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> watches Moon lying on the floor shaking and grimaces. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS280
00:59:34,00 --> 00:59:40,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> and SOMEONE<Rooster> watch the cabin from high up on the hill above it. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS281
00:59:38,00 --> 00:59:43,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> readies his rifle and pistol. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS283
01:00:10,00 --> 01:00:14,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> eyes him nervously. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS284
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:19,50
He gets comfy. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS285
01:01:18,00 --> 01:01:24,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> picks up his rifle and looks down into the gloom. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS286
01:01:21,00 --> 01:01:26,50
A lone rider approaches the cabin. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS287
01:01:38,00 --> 01:01:45,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> and SOMEONE<Rooster> watch the rider head along a track towards the cabin then stop. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS288
01:01:43,00 --> 01:01:48,50
Smoke billows from the cabin’s chimney. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS289
01:01:49,00 --> 01:01:54,50
The rider dismounts and walks his horse toward the cabin. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS290
01:02:09,00 --> 01:02:16,50
As SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> enters the cabin, several more riders approach. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS291
01:02:18,00 --> 01:02:26,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> cocks his rifle and takes aim. SOMEONE<Mattie> looks nervously between the cabin and the approaching posse. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS292
01:02:31,00 --> 01:02:36,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> and SOMEONE<Rooster> keep watching from the hill. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS293
01:02:34,00 --> 01:02:43,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> walks out of the cabin and steps up to the four riders who sit side by side on their horses facing him. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS294
01:03:14,00 --> 01:03:19,50
Two of the riders move closer to SOMEONE<LaBoeuf>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS297
01:03:20,00 --> 01:03:25,50
One of them lassoes him with a rope, pulls him over, He drags him along the ground. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS298
01:03:26,00 --> 01:03:32,50
The other man gets off his horse and walks toward the cabin. SOMEONE<Rooster> shoots him. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS299
01:03:32,00 --> 01:03:37,50
The man flops to the ground in the doorway. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS300
01:03:34,00 --> 01:03:41,50
The three men still on horseback shoot up towards the hill. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS301
01:03:38,00 --> 01:03:43,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> methodically shoots back with his rifle. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS302
01:03:41,00 --> 01:03:47,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> gets dragged around in the dirt. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS303
01:03:44,00 --> 01:03:49,50
A horse and rider collapses. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS305
01:03:53,00 --> 01:04:00,50
The rider springs up and jumps on the back of one of the other horses as it gallops away. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS306
01:03:58,00 --> 01:04:02,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> takes aim. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS307
01:04:04,00 --> 01:04:10,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> shoots and the man in the saddle falls. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS308
01:04:07,00 --> 01:04:13,50
The guy who jumped on the back takes the saddle and escapes. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS309
01:04:11,00 --> 01:04:16,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> holds his rifle upright. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS310
01:04:20,00 --> 01:04:28,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> and SOMEONE<Mattie> walk past the dead man to SOMEONE<LaBoeuf>, who's mouth is covered in blood. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS311
01:04:25,00 --> 01:04:29,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> looks him over. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS312
01:05:08,00 --> 01:05:12,50
He pulls SOMEONE's<LaBoeuf's> tongue. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS314
01:05:56,00 --> 01:06:01,50
Snowflakes gently drift through the darkness. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS315
01:06:14,00 --> 01:06:19,50
The dead men are propped up outside the cabin. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS316
01:06:16,00 --> 01:06:22,50
Inside, SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> sits with a bandage over his shoulder. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS317
01:06:20,00 --> 01:06:24,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> lies on a bunk. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS318
01:06:21,00 --> 01:06:25,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> goes in. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS319
01:07:09,00 --> 01:07:14,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> drinks whiskey from a bottle. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS320
01:08:23,00 --> 01:08:28,50
They slowly ride across the SOMEONE<frosty> plains. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS321
01:09:22,00 --> 01:09:27,50
He throws his bottle in the air. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS322
01:09:26,00 --> 01:09:31,50
He misses and the bottle lands on the grass. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS323
01:09:28,00 --> 01:09:33,50
On the fourth shot, the bottle breaks. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS324
01:09:43,00 --> 01:09:50,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> stares at SOMEONE<Rooster> who dismounts and tumbles to the ground. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS325
01:09:47,00 --> 01:09:54,50
He keeps hold of his horse's reigns and drunkenly struggles to his feet. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS326
01:09:56,00 --> 01:10:02,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> twirls his gun in his hand and goes to his saddle bag. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS327
01:09:59,00 --> 01:10:05,50
He digs around and some bits of yellow cornbread fall out. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS328
01:10:06,00 --> 01:10:11,50
He takes a piece and stands with his legs apart. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS329
01:10:08,00 --> 01:10:13,50
He throws the cornbread in the air 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS330
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:15,50
and shoots it to bits. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS332
01:10:15,00 --> 01:10:23,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> just stares at SOMEONE<Rooster> who goes to get more cornbread from his saddle bag. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS333
01:10:29,00 --> 01:10:33,50
He throws two pieces in the air. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS334
01:10:31,00 --> 01:10:36,50
And before he can shoot, SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> takes a shot. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS335
01:10:36,00 --> 01:10:41,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> misses and stares at his gun frowning. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS336
01:10:39,00 --> 01:10:43,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> goes to his saddle bag. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS337
01:10:47,00 --> 01:10:52,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> hurls yet another piece. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS338
01:10:49,00 --> 01:10:54,50
Both he and SOMEONE shoot 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS339
01:10:51,00 --> 01:10:55,50
and the cornbread explodes. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS341
01:11:11,00 --> 01:11:16,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> holsters his gun and SOMEONE<Rooster> hurls another piece. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS342
01:11:16,00 --> 01:11:21,50
He shoots wildly. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS343
01:11:23,00 --> 01:11:32,50
Under a pale sky SOMEONE<Mattie>, SOMEONE<Rooster>, and SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> ride across a vast prairie of short patchy grass. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS344
01:11:30,00 --> 01:11:35,50
Behind them, in the distance, is a mountain range. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS346
01:11:42,00 --> 01:11:49,50
Fluffy white clouds hang in a blue sky above the trio as their horses plod on across a largely featureless landscape. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS348
01:11:54,00 --> 01:11:58,50
They ride through longer grass beside a river. Another empty whiskey bottle hits the water. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS350
01:12:08,00 --> 01:12:15,50
The three riders meander through tangled pale bare trees. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS351
01:12:13,00 --> 01:12:17,50
They cross a river. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS352
01:12:14,00 --> 01:12:22,50
Under a canopy of swollen dark gray clouds, they head across a plain of straw-like grass. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS353
01:12:28,00 --> 01:12:37,50
As they head through a pine forest, SOMEONE<Rooster> sticks another empty bottle over the end of a thin stubby branch. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS354
01:12:49,00 --> 01:12:55,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> stands framed by the square entrance to a dark mine. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS355
01:12:55,00 --> 01:13:00,50
He shoots into the darkness. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS356
01:12:59,00 --> 01:13:02,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> looks in. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS357
01:13:00,00 --> 01:13:06,50
The entrance is surrounded by craggy stone cliffs. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS358
01:13:12,00 --> 01:13:16,50
A rainy night. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS359
01:13:13,00 --> 01:13:21,50
By a campfire, SOMEONE<Mattie> mashes some cornbread and water and holds it out to SOMEONE<LaBoeuf>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS360
01:13:28,00 --> 01:13:32,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> brings wood. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS361
01:14:00,00 --> 01:14:04,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> stands. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS362
01:14:20,00 --> 01:14:24,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> sits staring at him. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS363
01:14:25,00 --> 01:14:29,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> looks shocked. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS364
01:15:43,00 --> 01:15:51,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> stares intensely at SOMEONE<Rooster> who sits beneath a hide canopy strung up between two trees. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS365
01:15:49,00 --> 01:15:53,50
She goes to see SOMEONE<LaBoeuf>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS366
01:16:33,00 --> 01:16:37,50
He looks earnest. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS367
01:17:14,00 --> 01:17:18,50
He mounts his horse. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS368
01:17:21,00 --> 01:17:25,50
He looks down at her from his horse. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS369
01:17:34,00 --> 01:17:38,50
He holds out his gloved hand. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS370
01:17:36,00 --> 01:17:40,50
SOMEONE's brow is pinched 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS371
01:17:37,00 --> 01:17:42,50
and tears glisten in her eyes. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS372
01:17:39,00 --> 01:17:45,50
She takes SOMEONE's<LaBoeuf's> hand and they hold each other's gaze for a moment. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS373
01:17:43,00 --> 01:17:47,50
He leans down to her. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS374
01:17:49,00 --> 01:17:55,50
He touches his hat, turns his horse, and rides off through the trees. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS375
01:17:53,00 --> 01:17:57,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> watches him go. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS377
01:17:56,00 --> 01:18:00,50
She goes back to the camp. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS378
01:18:03,00 --> 01:18:08,50
The fire glows gold on her young face. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS379
01:18:06,00 --> 01:18:11,50
She looks down at SOMEONE<Rooster> sleeping on animal hides. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS380
01:18:09,00 --> 01:18:14,50
She picks up a reel of rope lying beside him 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS381
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:16,50
And lays it on the ground surrounding her bedding. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS382
01:18:15,00 --> 01:18:20,50
Later, SOMEONE<Mattie> sleeps soundly wrapped in a blanket. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS384
01:18:26,00 --> 01:18:32,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> slumbers, a disheveled heap. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS385
01:18:31,00 --> 01:18:35,50
SOMEONE watches him for a moment. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS387
01:18:36,00 --> 01:18:41,50
She pulls back her blanket and gets up. She picks up a wooden bucket by its rope handle. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS388
01:18:41,00 --> 01:18:50,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> carries the wooden bucket through the wintry brush, her oversized coat belted up tightly around her waist. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS389
01:18:48,00 --> 01:18:57,50
She passes between slender leafless trees crossing the snow dappled ground to the edge of a shallow, fast moving river. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS390
01:18:55,00 --> 01:19:02,50
She takes a few uninhibited steps into the water and dips the bucket. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS391
01:19:03,00 --> 01:19:10,50
She looks up to see three or four horses drinking from the water on the opposite side. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS392
01:19:08,00 --> 01:19:14,50
A figure steps out from behind a thicket with his back to her. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS393
01:19:11,00 --> 01:19:16,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> stares at him as he tends to the horses. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS394
01:19:14,00 --> 01:19:18,50
The man turns to look at her. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS395
01:19:16,00 --> 01:19:21,50
He has a black SOMEONE<mark> on his left cheek. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS396
01:19:19,00 --> 01:19:23,50
It's SOMEONE<Tom>. They lock eyes. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS397
01:19:24,00 --> 01:19:28,50
They lock eyes. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS398
01:19:25,00 --> 01:19:31,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> drops the bucket and it floats away on the water. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS399
01:19:29,00 --> 01:19:34,50
SOMEONE<Chaney> takes a rifle from over his shoulder and advances a few steps with the gun leveled at her. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS402
01:19:37,00 --> 01:19:42,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> fumbles in her coat pocket. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS403
01:19:50,00 --> 01:19:54,50
SOMEONE<Chaney> shakes his head. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS404
01:20:03,00 --> 01:20:11,50
Having slung the rifle back over his shoulder, SOMEONE<Chaney> watches SOMEONE<Mattie> wrest her pistol from the potato sack. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS405
01:20:11,00 --> 01:20:19,50
SOMEONE<Chaney> narrows his eyes incredulously. He looks away, then raises his eyebrows. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS408
01:20:58,00 --> 01:21:05,50
She shoots him as he starts towards her and the recoil puts her on her backside in the water. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS409
01:21:03,00 --> 01:21:07,50
SOMEONE<Chaney> doubles in pain. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS410
01:21:04,00 --> 01:21:09,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> picks herself up again. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS411
01:21:25,00 --> 01:21:34,50
An indignant SOMEONE<Chaney> stalks toward her. She pulls the trigger but the gun doesn't fire. SOMEONE<Chaney> snatches it and strikes her. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS412
01:21:33,00 --> 01:21:38,50
SOMEONE<Chaney> marches her across the river. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS414
01:21:37,00 --> 01:21:45,50
Two men open fire on SOMEONE<Rooster> from the other side of the river and he takes cover behind a tree. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS416
01:21:46,00 --> 01:21:52,50
SOMEONE trade shots with the men who then disappear into the woods 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS417
01:21:49,00 --> 01:21:53,50
with SOMEONE<Mattie> and SOMEONE<Chaney>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS418
01:21:54,00 --> 01:21:59,50
An ugly rat faced man has SOMEONE<Mattie> by the wrist. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS419
01:22:01,00 --> 01:22:09,50
The man, Lucky Ned, throws her to the ground. He draws a revolver and stamps a boot against her cheek. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS420
01:22:14,00 --> 01:22:19,50
He sneers and lifts his gaze. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS421
01:22:20,00 --> 01:22:25,50
He keeps his gun pointed at SOMEONE<Mattie>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS423
01:23:16,00 --> 01:23:21,50
Out of sight in the trees, he drags her to her feet and they continue. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS424
01:23:20,00 --> 01:23:25,50
A simpleton springs out. The man waggles his elbows like a chicken.  

TRUE_GRIT_DVS425
01:23:24,00 --> 01:23:31,50
Reconvened, they climb a steep track. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS426
01:23:30,00 --> 01:23:34,50
They approach a camp. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS427
01:23:52,00 --> 01:23:57,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> and SOMEONE<Ned> sit by the fire. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS428
01:24:15,00 --> 01:24:19,50
SOMEONE<Ned> smirks. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS429
01:24:56,00 --> 01:25:01,50
A distant SOMEONE<Rooster> fires his pistol at the sky. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS430
01:24:59,00 --> 01:25:08,50
SOMEONE<Ned> responds in kind then watches through a telescope as SOMEONE<Rooster> heads off on his horse with Little Blackie close behind. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS431
01:25:06,00 --> 01:25:10,50
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE, 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS432
01:25:07,00 --> 01:25:13,50
and twirling the slender telescope between his fingers, 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS433
01:25:10,00 --> 01:25:15,50
he sits down opposite her by the campfire. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS435
01:26:52,00 --> 01:26:56,50
The men ride off on horseback leaving SOMEONE<Chaney> alone with SOMEONE<Mattie>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS437
01:27:14,00 --> 01:27:22,50
Clutching his rifle like a walking stick and holding a gloved hand to his injured chest, 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS438
01:27:19,00 --> 01:27:24,50
SOMEONE<Chaney> sits down on a box by the flickering campfire. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS440
01:27:26,00 --> 01:27:33,50
He hangs his head and stares at the ground. SOMEONE<Mattie> looks somewhat disgusted by his self-pity. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS441
01:27:53,00 --> 01:27:57,50
SOMEONE's<Chaney's> eyes are closed. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS443
01:28:07,00 --> 01:28:12,50
SOMEONE<Chaney> wears a brooding expression. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS444
01:28:12,00 --> 01:28:17,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> stares at him expectantly. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS445
01:28:15,00 --> 01:28:19,50
He looks at her. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS446
01:28:21,00 --> 01:28:27,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> swallows. Smoke rises from the fire between them as SOMEONE<Chaney> rises. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS447
01:28:28,00 --> 01:28:34,50
He pounces, pinning her to the ground and putting a knife to her throat. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS448
01:28:45,00 --> 01:28:53,50
Clobbered with a rifle butt, SOMEONE<Chaney> hits the ground. SOMEONE<Mattie> looks up to see SOMEONE<LaBoeuf>. SOMEONE's<Chaney's> unconscious. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS449
01:29:13,00 --> 01:29:17,50
They look down at the plain. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS450
01:29:18,00 --> 01:29:25,50
On the dusty scrub land below, SOMEONE rides back towards SOMEONE and his three gang members, 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS451
01:29:23,00 --> 01:29:28,50
one of whom is the blithering simpleton. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS452
01:29:26,00 --> 01:29:36,50
They bring their horses to a halt as SOMEONE<Rooster> draws near. Gaunt, whiskered SOMEONE<Ned> peers out at SOMEONE<Rooster> from beneath a broad-rimmed hat. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS453
01:30:23,00 --> 01:30:28,50
SOMEONE<Ned> flashes a yellow grin. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS454
01:30:31,00 --> 01:30:38,50
SOMEONE draws a rifle and SOMEONE two pistols, gripping the reigns between his teeth 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS455
01:30:36,00 --> 01:30:41,50
as he gallops toward his four foes. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS457
01:30:40,00 --> 01:30:48,50
Charging, SOMEONE's<Ned's> men fan out. SOMEONE<Rooster> shoots the simpleton. SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> aims his rifle. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS460
01:30:50,00 --> 01:30:57,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> shoots and one of SOMEONE's<Ned's> men slumps down the side of his saddle. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS461
01:30:54,00 --> 01:30:59,50
Another puts a bullet through SOMEONE's<Rooster's> shoulder. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS462
01:30:56,00 --> 01:31:01,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> blasts him through the chest. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS463
01:30:58,00 --> 01:31:05,50
The man tumbles from his horse, cracking his head against a rock in a shower of blood. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS464
01:31:03,00 --> 01:31:08,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> and SOMEONE<Ned> each fire as they cross paths. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS465
01:31:06,00 --> 01:31:11,50
SOMEONE<Ned> buckles and SOMEONE's<Rooster's> horse goes down. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS466
01:31:09,00 --> 01:31:14,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> stands sharply and gasps. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS467
01:31:15,00 --> 01:31:22,50
A dust cloud rises from the ground where SOMEONE's<Rooster's> horse has fallen. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS468
01:31:19,00 --> 01:31:24,50
His leg is trapped beneath it 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS469
01:31:21,00 --> 01:31:26,50
and he struggles in vain to free himself. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS470
01:31:24,00 --> 01:31:29,50
SOMEONE<Ned> approaches, sitting slumped on his horse. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS471
01:31:26,00 --> 01:31:33,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> squints down the barrel of his rifle as he takes aim. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS472
01:31:32,00 --> 01:31:36,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> pants. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS473
01:31:42,00 --> 01:31:47,50
SOMEONE<Ned> limply points and cocks his pistol. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS474
01:31:44,00 --> 01:31:48,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> takes a breath. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS475
01:31:46,00 --> 01:31:52,50
SOMEONE<Ned> is but a tiny speck far below on the plain. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS477
01:31:54,00 --> 01:32:00,50
Still astride his horse, SOMEONE<Ned> doesn't move a muscle. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS478
01:31:57,00 --> 01:32:03,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> looks up from his gun and frowns. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS479
01:32:01,00 --> 01:32:05,50
SOMEONE<Ned> topples over. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS481
01:32:14,00 --> 01:32:20,50
SOMEONE<Chaney> bashes SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> on the head with a boulder, knocking him unconscious. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS482
01:32:18,00 --> 01:32:24,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> quickly grabs his rifle but SOMEONE<Chaney> gets hold of the barrel. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS483
01:32:21,00 --> 01:32:26,50
SOMEONE rests it free of his grasp 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS484
01:32:23,00 --> 01:32:27,50
and traps him in her sights. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS485
01:32:25,00 --> 01:32:29,50
She makes sure the gun is cocked. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS486
01:32:30,00 --> 01:32:35,50
Scowling, he does as he's told. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS488
01:32:34,00 --> 01:32:46,50
She blasts him off the cliff edge. Thrown off balance by the recoil, SOMEONE<Mattie> trips over a log and tumbles backwards through a crevice into a subterranean cave. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS489
01:32:44,00 --> 01:32:54,50
Bouncing down a steep rocky slope, she lands on her back and snags her foot on a tree root. Light pours in through the dust shrouded mouth of the cave. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS490
01:32:52,00 --> 01:32:57,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> grimaces in pain and sits up slightly. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS491
01:32:57,00 --> 01:33:02,50
She tries to free her foot but cannot. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS492
01:33:03,00 --> 01:33:08,50
Breathless, she stares up through the narrow cave mouth. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS493
01:33:16,00 --> 01:33:21,50
She collapses back despairingly. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS494
01:33:19,00 --> 01:33:23,50
then sits up again. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS496
01:33:25,00 --> 01:33:34,50
She glances about the cave and frowns as her eyes alight on a dead body lying just a few feet away. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS497
01:33:31,00 --> 01:33:36,50
She slowly looks the dead man over 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS498
01:33:33,00 --> 01:33:39,50
and spots a knife ina belt around his waist. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS499
01:33:48,00 --> 01:33:54,50
SOMEONE reaches out and grasps one of the man’s boots, 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS500
01:33:51,00 --> 01:33:56,50
dragging him closer with surprising ease. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS501
01:33:54,00 --> 01:34:00,50
As she does so, his leg comes apart at the knee. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS502
01:33:57,00 --> 01:34:03,50
She instead pulls his thigh and then his shirt 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS503
01:34:00,00 --> 01:34:04,50
which rips as she does so. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS505
01:34:07,00 --> 01:34:12,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> stares in horror. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS506
01:34:09,00 --> 01:34:17,50
In the hollow where the corpse’s viscera should be is a coiled and glistening rattlesnake. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS507
01:34:17,00 --> 01:34:21,50
It starts to move. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS508
01:34:24,00 --> 01:34:30,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> pulls away but the corpse slides closer. She panics. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS509
01:34:29,00 --> 01:34:33,50
She turns to look at the corpse, her head now level with its fleshless skull. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS511
01:34:36,00 --> 01:34:40,50
The snake slithers closer. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS512
01:34:39,00 --> 01:34:44,50
She sits up and fumbles with the tree root. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS514
01:34:52,00 --> 01:34:58,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> throws a rope into the cave and starts down the slope. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS515
01:34:56,00 --> 01:35:04,50
A snake glides onto SOMEONE's<Mattie's> shoulder and she flings it aside. As SOMEONE<Rooster> descends clutching the rope,

TRUE_GRIT_DVS516
01:35:01,00 --> 01:35:07,50
another snake sinks its teeth into her left hand. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS518
01:35:08,00 --> 01:35:13,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> shoots his pistol at the ground. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS519
01:35:13,00 --> 01:35:19,50
He reaches SOMEONE<Mattie> who grimaces in pain. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS521
01:35:24,00 --> 01:35:29,50
She nods at her hand which he grasps. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS523
01:35:27,00 --> 01:35:32,50
There are two puncture marks in her flesh. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS524
01:35:32,00 --> 01:35:40,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> closes her eyes and SOMEONE<Rooster> scores an X between the fang marks with his large hunting knife. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS525
01:35:41,00 --> 01:35:47,50
He sucks poison from the wound and spits it out. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS526
01:35:48,00 --> 01:35:55,50
He cuts her foot free of the tree root and returns the knife to his back pocket. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS528
01:35:55,00 --> 01:35:59,50
Wrapping the rope around them both, he then takes SOMEONE<Mattie> in his arms. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS529
01:36:01,00 --> 01:36:08,50
SOMEONE<LaBoeuf> walks Little Blackie away from the cave, pulling SOMEONE<Rooster> and SOMEONE<Mattie> up on the rope. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS531
01:36:36,00 --> 01:36:40,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> gallops off with SOMEONE<Mattie> through trees. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS532
01:36:39,00 --> 01:36:46,50
They continues along the plain passing the slain bodies of SOMEONE's gang. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS533
01:36:46,00 --> 01:36:52,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> looks down at the simpleton lying sprawled on the dry earth. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS534
01:36:49,00 --> 01:36:55,50
SOMEONE's<Rooster's> horse lies dead beside SOMEONE<Ned>, Who’s own horse stands over him. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS537
01:37:03,00 --> 01:37:08,50
Silhouetted against the pale sky, SOMEONE<Rooster> gallops on across the dusty plain. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS538
01:37:12,00 --> 01:37:19,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> glances at the setting sun, her face cast in its golden glow. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS539
01:37:21,00 --> 01:37:26,50
Sets in and soon gives way to night. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS540
01:37:24,00 --> 01:37:28,50
But Little Blackie keeps going. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS541
01:37:26,00 --> 01:37:32,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> and SOMEONE<Mattie> ride on through trees and tall grass. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS542
01:37:30,00 --> 01:37:34,50
The sky is black. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS543
01:37:32,00 --> 01:37:36,50
The horse begins to tire. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS544
01:37:48,00 --> 01:37:53,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> stabs Little Blackie. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS546
01:37:57,00 --> 01:38:01,50
Little Blackie forages onward, kicking up dust in his wake. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS547
01:38:04,00 --> 01:38:12,50
Little Blackie's breath clouds in front of him. His neck glistening with sweat in the moonlight. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS548
01:38:10,00 --> 01:38:16,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> sways back and forth along with the horses labored gait. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS549
01:38:13,00 --> 01:38:18,50
She sees a silhouetted horseman up ahead. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS550
01:38:26,00 --> 01:38:32,50
Little Blackie hobbles to a standstill. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS551
01:38:37,00 --> 01:38:44,50
Little Blackie sinks to his knees and topples over, spilling SOMEONE<Mattie> and SOMEONE<Rooster> from the saddle. Little Blackie's head hits the ground with a thud. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS552
01:38:42,00 --> 01:38:47,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> drags SOMEONE<Mattie> away from him. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS557
01:38:52,00 --> 01:38:58,50
SOMEONE looks at the exhausted horse and put his hand on his pistol. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS558
01:39:06,00 --> 01:39:11,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> bends down to scoop SOMEONE<Mattie> up in his arms. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS560
01:39:10,00 --> 01:39:14,50
She resists, pushing him away bitterly, and beating at his chest with balled fists. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS562
01:39:15,00 --> 01:39:20,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> picks her up and her aggression subsides. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS563
01:39:18,00 --> 01:39:23,50
SOMEONE gazes back tearfully at Little Blackie 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS564
01:39:21,00 --> 01:39:26,50
as SOMEONE<Rooster> carries her away across the plain. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS565
01:39:34,00 --> 01:39:41,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> lulls her head back and SOMEONE<Rooster> picks up his pace, trotting briskly on as fast as his legs. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS566
01:39:38,00 --> 01:39:43,50
SOMEONE<will> carry him. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS567
01:39:48,00 --> 01:39:57,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> stares ahead with a look of determination, his grizzled countenance picked out by the pale moonlight. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS568
01:40:07,00 --> 01:40:12,50
SOMEONE has a pained and weary face, her hair damp with sweat and her brow deeply furrowed. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS572
01:40:20,00 --> 01:40:24,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> staggers to a halt and drops to his knees. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS575
01:40:24,00 --> 01:40:30,50
He takes out his pistol and points it in the air. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS576
01:40:30,00 --> 01:40:36,50
Cradling SOMEONE<Mattie> in his arms, SOMEONE<Rooster> hangs his head. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS577
01:40:34,00 --> 01:40:39,50
A light comes on in a house a short distance away. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS578
01:40:42,00 --> 01:40:50,50
A figure dressed in white long-johns steps out onto the front porch with a lantern. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS579
01:40:54,00 --> 01:40:58,50
SOMEONE<Rooster> looks down at SOMEONE<Mattie>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS580
01:40:56,00 --> 01:41:02,50
The image of the figure on the porch fades to black. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS581
01:41:05,00 --> 01:41:10,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> stares out of a train window. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS582
01:41:08,00 --> 01:41:15,50
Now a grown woman with slim features and a severe expression, she wears her dark hair up beneath a flat-brimmed hat. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS584
01:41:15,00 --> 01:41:21,50
The train stops and she steps down onto a railway platform, 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS587
01:41:26,00 --> 01:41:31,50
her left arm now ends at the elbow. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS588
01:41:56,00 --> 01:42:01,50
It reads. "For a wild-west show". 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS589
01:42:12,00 --> 01:42:18,50
She approaches two seated men on the show site. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS590
01:42:27,00 --> 01:42:31,50
SOMEONE<Cole> stands. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS591
01:43:05,00 --> 01:43:09,50
SOMEONE<Cole> nods. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS592
01:43:08,00 --> 01:43:13,50
She glares at seated Mr. SOMEONE<James>. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS593
01:43:13,00 --> 01:43:17,50
She walks away. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS594
01:43:19,00 --> 01:43:26,50
SOMEONE's<Rooster's> coffin is loaded onto a train. Ashen faced, SOMEONE<Mattie> stands at his grave. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS595
01:43:37,00 --> 01:43:41,50
His headstone reads Ruben Cogburn. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS597
01:44:00,00 --> 01:44:07,50
Snow drifts down on the plot where a small number of gravestones are clustered. 

TRUE_GRIT_DVS598
01:44:04,00 --> 01:44:10,50
SOMEONE<Mattie> cuts a lonely figure as she walks away.
