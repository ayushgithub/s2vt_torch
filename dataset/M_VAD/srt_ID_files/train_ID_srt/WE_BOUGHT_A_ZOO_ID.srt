WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS20
00:03:28,00 --> 00:03:32,50
They arrive at school. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS21
00:03:31,00 --> 00:03:38,50
As SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> son slings his backpack over his shoulder, a strap breaks. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS22
00:03:37,00 --> 00:03:41,50
His books fall out. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS23
00:03:43,00 --> 00:03:47,50
He takes his daughter's hand. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS24
00:03:50,00 --> 00:03:56,50
His son grabs his lunch and hurries off. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS25
00:03:56,00 --> 00:04:01,50
A blonde woman holds out a casserole dish. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS26
00:04:02,00 --> 00:04:06,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> accepts it. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS27
00:04:06,00 --> 00:04:11,50
Still holding onto the dish, she draws him closer. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS28
00:04:18,00 --> 00:04:22,50
She gives a sultry look. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS29
00:04:20,00 --> 00:04:25,50
Smiling politely, he heads away. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS30
00:04:26,00 --> 00:04:36,50
As he returns to his car, a group of chatting mothers gazes after him. Later, he strolls a neighborhood with a rugged-	faced man. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS31
00:04:51,00 --> 00:04:55,50
They glance at a diner. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS32
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:16,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> spots a restaurant ahead and his face falls. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS33
00:05:17,00 --> 00:05:21,50
He turns away. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS34
00:05:39,00 --> 00:05:44,50
He drapes an arm around SOMEONE<Benjamin>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS35
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:05,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> blinks his contemplative eyes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS36
00:06:13,00 --> 00:06:17,50
The two men bow to each other. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS37
00:06:16,00 --> 00:06:20,50
They hug. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS38
00:06:21,00 --> 00:06:24,50
They part ways. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS39
00:06:23,00 --> 00:06:28,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> bows to him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS40
00:06:27,00 --> 00:06:31,50
His brother spreads his arms. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS41
00:06:30,00 --> 00:06:34,50
Now, in an office. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS42
00:06:50,00 --> 00:06:55,50
The silver-haired editor lifts his brow. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS43
00:07:26,00 --> 00:07:30,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> turns away. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS44
00:07:31,00 --> 00:07:36,50
He slings his bag onto his shoulder. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS45
00:08:04,00 --> 00:08:09,50
Later in a principal's office. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS46
00:08:08,00 --> 00:08:12,50
his son sits beside him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS47
00:08:28,00 --> 00:08:37,50
He strides to an open awning window which jiggles in the wind. Steadying it, he takes out a tool on his keychain. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS48
00:08:41,00 --> 00:08:48,50
Entering the office, the principal furrows his brow as he sees SOMEONE<Benjamin> fiddling with his window. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS49
00:09:10,00 --> 00:09:17,50
He beckons SOMEONE<Benjamin> into the hall and leads him past artwork posted above the lockers. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS50
00:09:36,00 --> 00:09:42,50
A drawing shows a man with his head flying off his sliced neck. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS51
00:09:58,00 --> 00:10:12,50
He holds SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> gaze. With concerned looks, both men shift their eyes back to SOMEONE's<Dylan's> drawing, where the bald 	decapitated man's tongue juts from his mouth in agony, as his head flies away from his body. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS52
00:10:10,00 --> 00:10:17,50
Blood spurts from his sliced neck and drips from slashes along his jawline. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS53
00:10:14,00 --> 00:10:20,50
The principal shoots the father a horrified glance, then heads off. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS54
00:10:18,00 --> 00:10:29,50
Turning thoughtfully to his son, SOMEONE<Benjamin> sees him leaning against the bank of lockers with his arms crossed. The 	teen stares back at him broodingly. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS55
00:10:28,00 --> 00:10:34,50
As his father approaches, SOMEONE<Dylan> hoists his backpack onto his shoulder. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS56
00:10:35,00 --> 00:10:41,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> strides out of the school with his son right behind him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS57
00:10:58,00 --> 00:11:06,50
At home, SOMEONE<Benjamin> opens the fridge to reveal stacks of plastic containers with notes on them. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS58
00:11:06,00 --> 00:11:12,50
His daughter watches as he fits the new casserole dish inside. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS59
00:11:19,00 --> 00:11:29,50
Sitting at a table in a breakfast nook, he smiles. He watches his daughter spread peanut butter and jelly on slices of 	bread in the adjoining kitchen. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS60
00:11:34,00 --> 00:11:41,50
She combines the slices to make two sandwiches, then grabs storage bags. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS61
00:11:51,00 --> 00:11:55,50
She bags the sandwiches. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS62
00:11:57,00 --> 00:12:03,50
Holding a marker, SOMEONE<Rosie> draws a check SOMEONE<mark> in the air. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS63
00:12:01,00 --> 00:12:06,50
She smiles as she resumes her work. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS64
00:12:03,00 --> 00:12:09,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> watches her with an amused loving stare. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS65
00:12:06,00 --> 00:12:13,50
On the storage bag's white label, SOMEONE<Rosie> writes PB and a backwards J. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS66
00:12:11,00 --> 00:12:19,50
Now, SOMEONE<Benjamin> pushes open SOMEONE's<Dylan's> bedroom door and finds his son asleep on top of the covers. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS67
00:12:16,00 --> 00:12:22,50
The teen's hand rests on a leather-bound book resembling a journal. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS68
00:12:20,00 --> 00:12:27,50
Entering the room, SOMEONE<Benjamin> gently lifts his son's hand and takes the book. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS69
00:12:24,00 --> 00:12:30,50
He sits on the edge of the bed and shoots SOMEONE<Dylan> a perplexed glance. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS70
00:12:28,00 --> 00:12:35,50
Furrowing his brow, he opens the book to a pair of skillfully drawn sketches. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS71
00:12:32,00 --> 00:12:38,50
One shows a bald burly man with a menacing look 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS72
00:12:35,00 --> 00:12:40,50
and the other depicts a hollow-cheeked face 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS73
00:12:37,00 --> 00:12:42,50
with a grim expression. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS74
00:12:39,00 --> 00:12:46,50
Dark-smudged pencil work creates gloomy shading around both figures. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS76
00:12:46,00 --> 00:12:53,50
Nodding, SOMEONE<Benjamin> turns the page. In the next sketch, a boy sits with his elbows on a table, his face buried in his hands. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS77
00:12:50,00 --> 00:12:57,50
At the center of the table, tiny people stand around a gaping chasm. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS78
00:12:54,00 --> 00:13:02,50
The sketch on the opposite page shows a woman cradling a baby while a figure watches from a doorway. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS79
00:12:59,00 --> 00:13:03,50
Flipping to the next two pages, 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS80
00:13:01,00 --> 00:13:06,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> finds a drawing filling up both sides. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS81
00:13:03,00 --> 00:13:17,50
In it, an anguished three-eyed face lets out a scream, its red uvula visible through its gaping mouth. SOMEONE<Benjamin> sets 	the sketchbook aside and caresses his son's shaggy brown bangs. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS82
00:13:14,00 --> 00:13:24,50
Later in a bathroom, he dabs his mouth with a towel and wipes his hands, then lifts his eyes to a mirror above the 	sink. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS83
00:13:22,00 --> 00:13:27,50
He stares at his weary defeated reflection. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS84
00:13:28,00 --> 00:13:34,50
He shifts his gaze to a cluster of pill bottles filling a shelf. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS85
00:13:31,00 --> 00:13:38,50
The shelf below contains jewelry, knick-knacks, and a framed photo of him and SOMEONE<Katherine>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS86
00:13:36,00 --> 00:13:41,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> lowers his heartbroken eyes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS87
00:13:44,00 --> 00:13:48,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> stands in the doorway. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS88
00:13:45,00 --> 00:13:51,50
Picking her up, SOMEONE<Benjamin> carries her into her bedroom. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS89
00:13:51,00 --> 00:13:59,50
Reaching a bed piled high with stuffed animals, he sits on its edge and sets SOMEONE<Rosie> on his lap. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS90
00:13:56,00 --> 00:14:02,50
He gazes out a window at a party in the yard next door. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS91
00:14:04,00 --> 00:14:09,50
She watches them with a doleful look. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS92
00:14:06,00 --> 00:14:11,50
Turning from the window, SOMEONE<Benjamin> holds her tighter. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS93
00:14:09,00 --> 00:14:21,50
She rests her head against his shoulder and closes her eyes. As he returns his attention to the young partygoers 	next door, a blonde woman holding a beer spots him and gives a friendly wave. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS94
00:14:19,00 --> 00:14:23,50
He smiles wistfully. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS95
00:14:23,00 --> 00:14:33,50
Daytime. In a car, SOMEONE<Benjamin> flips through a binder of property listings as he rides besides a dimple-chinned man in 	glasses. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS96
00:14:30,00 --> 00:14:36,50
In the back seat, SOMEONE<Rosie> plays with a digital camera. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS97
00:15:04,00 --> 00:15:08,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> nods. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS98
00:16:07,00 --> 00:16:15,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> eyes the real estate agent thoughtfully, then shrugs his lips in an accepting look. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS99
00:16:13,00 --> 00:16:20,50
Now, SOMEONE<Rosie> lifts the camera as they cruise past a Tudor-style house. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS100
00:16:19,00 --> 00:16:28,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> flips to another listing in the binder. They drive past a plain-gray, two-story home with red trim. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS101
00:16:27,00 --> 00:16:33,50
They pass a cozy-looking white house with an ivy-covered chimney. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS102
00:16:32,00 --> 00:16:42,50
Flipping through the binder, SOMEONE<Benjamin> furrows his brow. They pull up in front of a ranch-style house with a yard 	covered in native-California plants. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS103
00:16:44,00 --> 00:16:49,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> holds out a listing. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS104
00:17:04,00 --> 00:17:09,50
They drive up a rustic tree-lined road. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS105
00:17:12,00 --> 00:17:24,50
Gazing out her window, SOMEONE<Rosie> smiles. Up ahead, the house lies shrouded behind a cluster of mature trees. A slack-	jawed SOMEONE<Benjamin> eyes the large property. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS106
00:17:21,00 --> 00:17:29,50
The car parks alongside an old wooden fence. We glimpse the sun through a canopy of tree branches, 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS107
00:17:26,00 --> 00:17:35,50
then find SOMEONE<Rosie> riding on her father's shoulders, aiming her camera at the quaint two-story Colonial house. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS108
00:17:45,00 --> 00:17:49,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> heads inside. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS109
00:17:48,00 --> 00:17:54,50
He looks around the spacious, mostly empty rooms. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS110
00:17:54,00 --> 00:17:58,50
He follows SOMEONE<Rosie> upstairs. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS111
00:17:56,00 --> 00:18:02,50
From a window, she overlooks the countryside. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS112
00:18:29,00 --> 00:18:35,50
Startled by the sound, SOMEONE<Benjamin> and SOMEONE<Rosie> look around. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS113
00:18:47,00 --> 00:18:53,50
Outside, a male lion walks up to a chain-link fence. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS114
00:18:50,00 --> 00:18:57,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin>, SOMEONE<Rosie>, and the real estate agent watch him from the other side. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS115
00:19:01,00 --> 00:19:05,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> looks up at her dad. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS117
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:38,50
He looks at his daughter, who lowers her saddened gaze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS118
00:19:57,00 --> 00:20:01,50
They leave the enclosure. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS119
00:20:05,00 --> 00:20:10,50
He looks back, but finds no sign of his daughter. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS120
00:20:13,00 --> 00:20:19,50
The real estate agent follows him up a set of stairs set into a hillside. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS121
00:20:21,00 --> 00:20:27,50
They find SOMEONE<Rosie> feeding crackers to peacocks. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS122
00:20:30,00 --> 00:20:35,50
The agent pats him on the shoulder, then walks off. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS123
00:20:39,00 --> 00:20:47,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> takes a seat on a rock and watches his daughter sprinkle her crackers on the ground. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS124
00:20:48,00 --> 00:20:56,50
As he glances aside and smiles, a ray of sunlight haloes his hair and shoulders. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS125
00:20:59,00 --> 00:21:04,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> meets her father's gaze and smiles. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS126
00:21:04,00 --> 00:21:10,50
Welling with emotion, SOMEONE<Benjamin> beams. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS127
00:21:08,00 --> 00:21:14,50
He chuckles to himself, then licks his wide lips. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS128
00:21:12,00 --> 00:21:26,50
Glancing back at the lion enclosure, he locks eyes with the big cat. Sunlight glares behind SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> joyful face. The 	lion's soulful eyes watch him through the chain links. Now, at SOMEONE's<Bernie's> Restaurant. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS129
00:21:53,00 --> 00:21:57,50
A waitress brings their food. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS131
00:23:36,00 --> 00:23:42,50
He storms off, leaving his father and sister at the dinner table. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS132
00:23:44,00 --> 00:23:49,50
They tap forks. Now they pack. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS133
00:23:53,00 --> 00:23:57,50
He holds up a sweatshirt. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS134
00:24:09,00 --> 00:24:14,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> shifts her jaw and gives a nod. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS135
00:24:16,00 --> 00:24:22,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> puts it in a donations box. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS136
00:24:23,00 --> 00:24:27,50
He holds out a monkey puppet. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS137
00:24:27,00 --> 00:24:35,50
Now the family's SUV drives through the neighborhood, followed by a Mayflower Moving truck. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS138
00:24:33,00 --> 00:24:40,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> eyes his rear view mirror, then glances back at SOMEONE<Dylan>, who wears earbuds. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS139
00:24:37,00 --> 00:24:45,50
The concerned father returns his attention to the road ahead and notices Little Dom's. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS140
00:24:42,00 --> 00:24:48,50
Patrons eat at sidewalk tables outside the corner cafe. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS141
00:24:50,00 --> 00:24:57,50
As he drives by, SOMEONE<Benjamin> stares at a bank of windows. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS142
00:24:54,00 --> 00:25:03,50
We glimpse SOMEONE<Katherine> sitting alone at a booth inside. Her brown eyes find us and she gives a pretty smile. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS143
00:25:03,00 --> 00:25:18,50
The SUV now leads the moving truck onto the zoo property. In the back seat, SOMEONE<Dylan> sighs and shifts his unhappy 	gaze. Indoors, a blonde teenage girl attaches light-up letters to a metal frame, which she displays in a window. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS144
00:25:21,00 --> 00:25:26,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> halts their vehicle. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS145
00:25:25,00 --> 00:25:31,50
The sign reads, Welcome, Brave New Owners. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS146
00:25:29,00 --> 00:25:35,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> waves to the blonde girl, who smiles and waves back. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS147
00:25:32,00 --> 00:25:37,50
From the back seat, SOMEONE<Rosie> waves as well. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS148
00:25:34,00 --> 00:25:45,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> stares curiously at the welcoming stranger inside the restaurant. She moves along the dingy windows, continuing to wave as she watches them drive on. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS149
00:25:42,00 --> 00:25:49,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> keeps his eyes on her until a tree finally blocks his view. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS150
00:25:46,00 --> 00:25:55,50
Now in a downpour, a burly bearded man in a raincoat pushes a wheelbarrow full of mulch. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS151
00:25:58,00 --> 00:26:03,50
A sultry woman stands in an old barn. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS152
00:26:01,00 --> 00:26:06,50
She watches the Mees move in. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS153
00:26:06,00 --> 00:26:12,50
She trades a look with her bearded colleague. SOMEONE<Benjamin> leads the kids to a door. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS154
00:26:15,00 --> 00:26:21,50
He opens it and their beagle darts in past the cluttered counters. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS155
00:26:30,00 --> 00:26:34,50
The boy sulks off. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS156
00:26:35,00 --> 00:26:41,50
Now on a dry day, the Mees meet the zoo staff outside. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS157
00:26:52,00 --> 00:26:56,50
The monkey waves to SOMEONE<Benjamin>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS158
00:27:50,00 --> 00:27:56,50
He glances at SOMEONE<Rosie>. SOMEONE<Kelly> shifts her skeptical gaze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS159
00:27:56,00 --> 00:28:02,50
He rubs SOMEONE's<Dylan's> shoulder, causing him to turn away in embarrassment. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS160
00:28:02,00 --> 00:28:08,50
Sitting on SOMEONE's<Robin's> shoulder, Crystal slaps a hand over her head. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS161
00:28:07,00 --> 00:28:13,50
He marches off, but the staff heads in the opposite direction. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS162
00:28:12,00 --> 00:28:18,50
An entry gate sign reads, Rosemoor Wildlife Park. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS163
00:28:20,00 --> 00:28:25,50
SOMEONE<Lily> walks with SOMEONE<Dylan>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS164
00:28:26,00 --> 00:28:30,50
SOMEONE<Lily> walks with SOMEONE<Dylan>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS165
00:28:38,00 --> 00:28:49,50
We glimpse a binturong crossing a branch, a fox lying in tall grass, one parrot grooming another, a camel licking its 	mouth, and a grizzly bear. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS166
00:29:06,00 --> 00:29:11,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> gives SOMEONE<Lily> an embarrassed look. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS167
00:29:12,00 --> 00:29:16,50
The frizzy-haired man heads off. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS168
00:29:19,00 --> 00:29:23,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> shyly averts his gaze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS169
00:29:24,00 --> 00:29:27,50
He moves off. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS170
00:29:29,00 --> 00:29:43,50
SOMEONE<Lily> hurries after him. SOMEONE<Kelly> leads the group down a trail lined with tall bushes. As they reach the low wall of a tiger 	enclosure, SOMEONE<Dylan> halts upon seeing the big cats and holds them in his attentive gaze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS171
00:29:40,00 --> 00:29:46,50
One of the tigers steps past two others lounging in the grass. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS172
00:29:43,00 --> 00:29:48,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> watches admiringly. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS173
00:30:04,00 --> 00:30:08,50
She leans on the wall. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS174
00:30:06,00 --> 00:30:10,50
A tiger perks up. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS175
00:30:12,00 --> 00:30:16,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> smiles a bit. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS176
00:30:17,00 --> 00:30:21,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> rolls his eyes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS177
00:30:40,00 --> 00:30:47,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> studies the old tiger. Later, SOMEONE<Kelly> and SOMEONE<Benjamin> walk ahead of the kids. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS178
00:31:14,00 --> 00:31:17,50
He takes notes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS179
00:31:30,00 --> 00:31:35,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> slows her pace and stuffs her hands in her pockets. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS180
00:31:50,00 --> 00:31:54,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> frowns pensively. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS181
00:32:28,00 --> 00:32:34,50
He lowers his thoughtful gaze and purses his lips. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS182
00:32:32,00 --> 00:32:37,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> waits for his reply. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS183
00:32:36,00 --> 00:32:41,50
He lifts his eyes and earnestly meets her gaze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS184
00:32:40,00 --> 00:32:45,50
The zookeeper's jaw goes slack. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS185
00:32:42,00 --> 00:32:49,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> smiles, then continues up the trail. He looks back with a grin. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS186
00:32:49,00 --> 00:32:58,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> stares after him with a pinched brow, then allows a faint smile as she jogs forward to catch up with him on a 	hill. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS187
00:32:57,00 --> 00:33:02,50
At night, SOMEONE<Benjamin> studies invoices. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS188
00:33:01,00 --> 00:33:13,50
Wearing reading glasses, he sits alone, at the end of the dining room table, in front of a laptop, and surrounded by 	bills. He touches his brow as he continues to review the expenses. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS189
00:33:11,00 --> 00:33:16,50
His attention drifts to a window. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS190
00:33:15,00 --> 00:33:19,50
He goes out onto the porch, 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS191
00:33:16,00 --> 00:33:23,50
ambles to the railing with his hands stuffed in his pockets, and listens. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS192
00:33:23,00 --> 00:33:29,50
He watches the wispy branches of a tree sway in the gentle breeze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS193
00:33:31,00 --> 00:33:35,50
He looks to his left. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS195
00:33:37,00 --> 00:33:41,50
He looks to the right, then back at the tree. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS196
00:33:42,00 --> 00:33:48,50
Soft moonlight shines on his curious face. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS197
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:52,50
He steps down from the porch. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS198
00:33:49,00 --> 00:33:56,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Dylan> lies in bed staring at a framed photo of himself with his mother. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS199
00:33:53,00 --> 00:34:01,50
He presses the picture to his chest, and wraps his arms around it, with tears in his eyes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS200
00:33:58,00 --> 00:34:03,50
Now, SOMEONE<Benjamin> enters the dim restaurant. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS201
00:34:01,00 --> 00:34:11,50
He finds the staff in a dining room, adorned with a framed photo of SOMEONE Warhol, as well as memorabilia of 	MacCready's daredevil past, 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS202
00:34:08,00 --> 00:34:15,50
including a photo of him giving a lion a ride in a vintage race car. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS203
00:34:24,00 --> 00:34:30,50
Noticing SOMEONE<Benjamin>, SOMEONE<MacCready> opens his arms. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS204
00:34:32,00 --> 00:34:38,50
He throws darts at a man's photo attached to a dartboard. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS205
00:34:58,00 --> 00:35:03,50
He pulls out a chair for SOMEONE<Benjamin>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS206
00:35:38,00 --> 00:35:44,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> brings him a beer. SOMEONE<Nathan> and SOMEONE<Robin> play chess at the bar. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS207
00:35:44,00 --> 00:36:05,50
The next day, SOMEONE<Benjamin> marches up a hill wearing a black skull cap, a tool belt, and brown work boots. He pauses to 	scan his surroundings, then continues on his way. As SOMEONE<Robin> works on a porcupine enclosure, Crystal hands him a 	tool. SOMEONE<Rhonda> interrupts to show him a ledger. SOMEONE<Benjamin> enters the enclosure with an armful of posts. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS208
00:36:03,00 --> 00:36:07,50
SOMEONE<Robin> notices. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS209
00:36:06,00 --> 00:36:13,50
An approaching porcupine startles the rookie and he backs away, fumbling a few posts. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS210
00:36:23,00 --> 00:36:31,50
It flares its quills. SOMEONE<Benjamin> drops his posts, hurdles the fence, and lands in a thicket of nettles. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS211
00:36:29,00 --> 00:36:33,50
SOMEONE<Robin> hurries over to help him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS212
00:36:33,00 --> 00:36:37,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> hops up in pain. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS213
00:36:45,00 --> 00:36:52,50
He yanks a nettle from SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> back. Now in a zebra enclosure. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS214
00:37:17,00 --> 00:37:22,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> works on an overhang. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS215
00:37:51,00 --> 00:37:55,50
An ostrich pesters him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS216
00:37:52,00 --> 00:38:00,50
In a barn loft, SOMEONE<Dylan> sketches in his pad. From a ladder, SOMEONE<Lily> climbs into view. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS217
00:37:57,00 --> 00:38:02,50
She greets SOMEONE<Dylan> with a sunny smile. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS218
00:38:01,00 --> 00:38:07,50
He lowers his shy gaze as she approaches with a basket draped with a napkin. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS219
00:38:09,00 --> 00:38:15,50
SOMEONE<Lily> kneels beside him and sets a sandwich on his other side. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS220
00:38:12,00 --> 00:38:17,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> glances at her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS221
00:38:14,00 --> 00:38:19,50
Dried blood rims one of his nostrils. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS222
00:38:27,00 --> 00:38:35,50
In black ink, he sketches a shriveled ghoulish face with stringy hair and black eye sockets. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS223
00:38:33,00 --> 00:38:38,50
SOMEONE<Lily> moves in close beside him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS224
00:38:35,00 --> 00:38:40,50
He timidly edges away a few inches. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS225
00:38:38,00 --> 00:38:44,50
Her cheery smile fades as she studies the picture. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS226
00:38:41,00 --> 00:38:47,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> bites his lip and shyly glances away. SOMEONE's<Lily's> smile briefly returns. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS228
00:38:48,00 --> 00:38:52,50
The boy presses his lips together. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS229
00:38:58,00 --> 00:39:04,50
Amused, SOMEONE's<Lily's> rosy lips turn up at the corners. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS230
00:39:02,00 --> 00:39:08,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> steals a curious glance. SOMEONE<Lily> grins to herself. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS231
00:39:08,00 --> 00:39:11,50
She beams, 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS232
00:39:09,00 --> 00:39:13,50
rattling her fist. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS233
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:23,50
As she climbs down, he cranes his neck to peer after her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS234
00:39:20,00 --> 00:39:24,50
In an office. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS235
00:39:28,00 --> 00:39:34,50
With a smarmy smile, SOMEONE<Rhonda> wags a finger. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS236
00:39:31,00 --> 00:39:39,50
She drops a stack of invoices in front of him and saunters off in her puppy-appliqued sweatshirt. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS237
00:39:36,00 --> 00:39:41,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> studies the bills. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS238
00:39:38,00 --> 00:39:47,50
As he writes one check after another, we glimpse an ocelot living in the zoo, then two curious ostriches. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS239
00:39:45,00 --> 00:39:51,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> doffs his reading glasses and rests his head in his hands. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS240
00:39:48,00 --> 00:39:57,50
Now outside, SOMEONE<Dylan> draws a sneering creature with no eyes or nose. He checks his watch. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS242
00:39:55,00 --> 00:40:00,50
He looks around, then resumes drawing. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS243
00:39:57,00 --> 00:40:02,50
SOMEONE<Lily> steps into view with her basket. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS244
00:40:00,00 --> 00:40:07,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> allows a brief smile as she cheerfully trots over and holds out a sandwich. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS245
00:40:08,00 --> 00:40:17,50
Accepting, he eyes its tidy paper wrapping and smiles up at her. SOMEONE<Lily> beams and prances away. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS246
00:40:14,00 --> 00:40:21,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> removes the seal decorated with Magic Marker then unwraps the sandwich. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS247
00:40:18,00 --> 00:40:27,50
Tucked inside the brown paper, he finds a cheerful drawing of a smiling sun wearing shades. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS248
00:40:24,00 --> 00:40:30,50
Big loopy letters spell, Hey SOMEONE<Dylan>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS249
00:40:27,00 --> 00:40:31,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> smiles. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS250
00:40:28,00 --> 00:40:32,50
In the office. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS251
00:40:47,00 --> 00:40:53,50
Nighttime. In the farmhouse, SOMEONE<Rosie> and SOMEONE<Dylan> husk corn. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS252
00:40:53,00 --> 00:40:58,50
The kids stare up dolefully. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS253
00:41:22,00 --> 00:41:30,50
Later, SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> car returns to the house. As he gets out with a grocery bag, SOMEONE<Kelly> passes by. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS254
00:41:53,00 --> 00:41:58,50
She rummages through supplies. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS255
00:42:15,00 --> 00:42:20,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> hands SOMEONE<Benjamin> a bucket. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS256
00:42:29,00 --> 00:42:35,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> steps closer, a scolding smile on his face. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS257
00:42:32,00 --> 00:42:39,50
Smirking, SOMEONE<Kelly> swivels away and walks toward an old pickup parked nearby. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS258
00:42:37,00 --> 00:42:45,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> gazes after the young woman as she hefts up a few supply bags slung around her shoulders. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS259
00:42:42,00 --> 00:42:47,50
Peering back, she catches him watching. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS260
00:42:44,00 --> 00:42:50,50
A smile just dawns on her face and she turns away. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS261
00:42:47,00 --> 00:42:53,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> approaches SOMEONE<Dylan>, who waits on the porch. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS262
00:42:55,00 --> 00:43:00,50
He lumbers wearily with the bucket and butter. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS263
00:43:01,00 --> 00:43:05,50
They head indoors. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS265
00:43:16,00 --> 00:43:20,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> halts on the footpath. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS266
00:43:19,00 --> 00:43:25,50
He watches his father and sister approach a barn, hand in hand. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS267
00:43:23,00 --> 00:43:30,50
He begrudgingly complies. Now at Spar's indoor cage. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS268
00:43:33,00 --> 00:43:37,50
Spar lies on his side. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS269
00:43:41,00 --> 00:43:46,50
Spar nudges his head closer to SOMEONE<Rosie>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS270
00:43:46,00 --> 00:43:51,50
The little girl regards her father tenderly. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS271
00:43:52,00 --> 00:43:57,50
SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> gaze softens appreciatively. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS272
00:43:54,00 --> 00:43:59,50
They view each other through the cage wire. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS273
00:44:04,00 --> 00:44:09,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> gives an understanding nod. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS274
00:44:06,00 --> 00:44:13,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> screws her mouth to one side, lifts her brow, and tilts her head. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS275
00:44:10,00 --> 00:44:16,50
Her father looks to Spar, then nods resolutely. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS276
00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:24,50
In the garage, SOMEONE<Dylan> peers into an open bin filled with wriggling mealworms. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS277
00:44:25,00 --> 00:44:32,50
The boy takes a recoiling step back, then looks around uneasily as he advances. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS278
00:44:29,00 --> 00:44:36,50
Ahead, a long flat crate lies on a steel table. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS279
00:44:33,00 --> 00:44:39,50
Stickers and stamps on every side read, Caution: Live Snakes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS280
00:44:37,00 --> 00:44:42,50
SOMEONE's<Dylan's> hand hovers over its metal latch. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS281
00:44:43,00 --> 00:44:50,50
He lifts the lid to reveal a writhing tangle of intertwined snakes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS282
00:44:47,00 --> 00:44:56,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> lowers the lid and flees. He neglects to latch it. On his way out, he switches off the lights. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS283
00:44:53,00 --> 00:44:59,50
Unsupervised, two snakes slither from the crate. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS284
00:44:56,00 --> 00:45:06,50
A third pokes its head out. Now SOMEONE<Benjamin> draws the curtains in SOMEONE's<Rosie's> bedroom. She lies buried in stuffed animals. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS285
00:45:15,00 --> 00:45:19,50
He takes a few toys off of her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS286
00:45:31,00 --> 00:45:36,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> comes out of his room. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS287
00:45:34,00 --> 00:45:39,50
He looks in, but remains unseen. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS288
00:45:36,00 --> 00:45:43,50
Tickling SOMEONE<Rosie>, SOMEONE<Benjamin> finds the old sweatshirt under the covers. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS289
00:45:51,00 --> 00:45:56,50
SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> smile fades. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS290
00:45:53,00 --> 00:45:59,50
His bewildered gaze shifts between SOMEONE<Rosie> and the shirt. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS291
00:46:22,00 --> 00:46:27,50
Clutching her monkey puppet, SOMEONE<Rosie> nods. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS292
00:46:35,00 --> 00:46:40,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> points in the air, then claps her hands together. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS293
00:46:44,00 --> 00:46:49,50
He places SOMEONE's<Rosie's> hand over her heart. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS294
00:46:49,00 --> 00:46:54,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> makes a heart shape with her hands. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS295
00:46:53,00 --> 00:46:58,50
She presses it to SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> shoulder. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS296
00:46:59,00 --> 00:47:04,50
Apart from them, SOMEONE<Dylan> wipes a tear. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS297
00:47:05,00 --> 00:47:11,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> shows the sweatshirt and SOMEONE<Rosie> nods. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS298
00:47:10,00 --> 00:47:15,50
She gently takes it from her father's grip. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS299
00:47:13,00 --> 00:47:22,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> returns to his room. Morning. As llamas, a hawk, and oxen stir, SOMEONE<Benjamin> works in the kitchen. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS300
00:47:48,00 --> 00:47:52,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> opens the front door. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS301
00:47:51,00 --> 00:47:59,50
Snakes infest the driveway. SOMEONE<Benjamin> runs out, turns tail, and runs back in. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS302
00:47:57,00 --> 00:48:05,50
Later, SOMEONE<Robin>, SOMEONE<Kelly>, SOMEONE<Benjamin>, SOMEONE<MacCready>, and SOMEONE<Dylan> collect the escaped snakes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS303
00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:16,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> watches from the porch. SOMEONE<Kelly> laughs at SOMEONE<Benjamin> gripping a handful of snakes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS304
00:48:18,00 --> 00:48:22,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> tries to put one in a bucket. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS305
00:48:39,00 --> 00:48:45,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> throws the bucket and drop kicks a snake. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS306
00:48:50,00 --> 00:49:00,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> storms inside. SOMEONE<Kelly> stares after him, then glares at SOMEONE<Benjamin>. A snake slithers at SOMEONE's<Rosie's> feet. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS307
00:48:57,00 --> 00:49:04,50
Later with SOMEONE<Benjamin>, SOMEONE<Kelly> threads a chunk of raw animal flesh. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS308
00:49:28,00 --> 00:49:32,50
She picks up a hawk. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS309
00:49:32,00 --> 00:49:37,50
She chucks it into a refrigerated locker. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS310
00:50:00,00 --> 00:50:06,50
Later, SOMEONE<Benjamin> pushes a wheelbarrow. SOMEONE<Kelly> escorts him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS311
00:50:12,00 --> 00:50:22,50
Elsewhere on the property, SOMEONE<Lily> rakes leaves. As a flashy black pickup passes on a nearby road, she uses a walkie-	talkie. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS312
00:50:42,00 --> 00:50:46,50
In the restaurant. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS313
00:50:45,00 --> 00:50:55,50
SOMEONE<Nathan> and another staffer hold the door shut. Outside, SOMEONE<Benjamin> joins SOMEONE<Robin> and SOMEONE<Kelly> as they wait to greet the 	arriving pickup. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS314
00:50:52,00 --> 00:51:09,50
The driver side door swings open and a pair of simple black boots step out. As the visitor turns, we recognize Ferris' 	features from the photo on the dartboard. Wearing a suit beneath a rugged parka, he approaches with a cocky 	disdainful smirk. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS315
00:51:42,00 --> 00:51:48,50
Both men whip out notepads in unison. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS316
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:53,50
SOMEONE<Ferris> steps in close. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS317
00:52:00,00 --> 00:52:04,50
SOMEONE<Ferris> looks her up and down. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS318
00:52:03,00 --> 00:52:08,50
She glowers at his sly smile. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS319
00:52:11,00 --> 00:52:15,50
SOMEONE<Ferris> lifts his brow. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS320
00:52:13,00 --> 00:52:18,50
He eyes SOMEONE<Benjamin> with mock surprise. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS321
00:52:19,00 --> 00:52:24,50
He dramatically makes a fist. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS322
00:52:23,00 --> 00:52:29,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> stares at his hand, which he wags slowly. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS323
00:52:27,00 --> 00:52:35,50
As SOMEONE<Ferris> moves off, SOMEONE<Benjamin> faces his colleagues and emphatically mouths, Wow. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS324
00:52:32,00 --> 00:52:44,50
They follow SOMEONE<Ferris> across the property. Later, as they hike up a grassy sun-kissed slope, SOMEONE<Ferris> snidely takes in his 	surroundings through sunglasses. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS325
00:52:41,00 --> 00:52:47,50
Now at SOMEONE's<Solomon's> enclosure, he scrutinizes a railing. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS326
00:52:58,00 --> 00:53:10,50
From a hip holster, SOMEONE<Ferris> whips out an electric tape measure. As he activates the device, its tape extends over a 	moat separating SOMEONE's<Solomon's> enclosure from the guard railing. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS327
00:53:07,00 --> 00:53:16,50
Cocking an eyebrow, SOMEONE<Ferris> faces SOMEONE<Benjamin>, who cocks his head and gives a few perfunctory nods. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS328
00:53:13,00 --> 00:53:20,50
The inspector shifts his gaze to SOMEONE<Kelly> and wiggles his eyebrows. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS329
00:53:17,00 --> 00:53:21,50
He reads the measurement. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS330
00:53:30,00 --> 00:53:34,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> makes a note. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS331
00:53:31,00 --> 00:53:36,50
Now at the tiger habitat. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS332
00:54:06,00 --> 00:54:12,50
SOMEONE<Ferris> pauses just long enough to give a derisive sneer. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS333
00:54:13,00 --> 00:54:20,50
In the restaurant, SOMEONE<MacCready> fights his way out of the restroom and stares at SOMEONE<Nathan>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS334
00:54:19,00 --> 00:54:26,50
Outside, the flashy black pickup speeds away, kicking up a trail of dust. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS335
00:54:31,00 --> 00:54:36,50
SOMEONE<MacCready> runs after the truck. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS336
00:54:45,00 --> 00:54:50,50
SOMEONE<Robin> eyes the notepad grimly. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS337
00:55:00,00 --> 00:55:04,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> zips off. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS338
00:55:12,00 --> 00:55:21,50
SOMEONE<Robin> and SOMEONE<Kelly> watch him go. Behind them, SOMEONE<Rhonda> shakes her head and makes notes. SOMEONE<Robin> smiles at SOMEONE<Kelly>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS339
00:55:30,00 --> 00:55:35,50
Crystal the Capuchin turns on SOMEONE's<Robin's> shoulder. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS340
00:55:39,00 --> 00:55:47,50
SOMEONE<Robin> points. About 50 yards away, SOMEONE<Benjamin> stands doubled over, catching his breath. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS341
00:55:47,00 --> 00:55:55,50
Oblivious to his observers, he straightens and fires a series of furious punches and kicks at the air. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS342
00:55:53,00 --> 00:55:57,50
SOMEONE<Robin> gives a pitying frown. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS343
00:55:55,00 --> 00:56:00,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> paces, hands on his hips. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS344
00:55:57,00 --> 00:56:02,50
He kicks over a large wooden barrel. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS345
00:55:59,00 --> 00:56:05,50
SOMEONE's<Kelly's> brow knits as she looks on, and SOMEONE<Rhonda> shakes her head. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS346
00:56:03,00 --> 00:56:10,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> remorsefully rights the barrel, then continues pacing. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS347
00:56:08,00 --> 00:56:15,50
Pressing her lips together, SOMEONE<Kelly> allows a warm amused smile. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS348
00:56:12,00 --> 00:56:20,50
Noticing the others watching, SOMEONE<Benjamin> affects a stoic demeanor and holds his hand up in a wave. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS349
00:56:17,00 --> 00:56:22,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> beams fondly at him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS350
00:56:19,00 --> 00:56:30,50
Now, SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> SUV travels a winding road among verdant hills. At the wheel, the father glances at SOMEONE<Dylan>, who 	rides shotgun. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS351
00:56:43,00 --> 00:56:49,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> blinks at his son, his mouth agape. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS352
00:56:50,00 --> 00:56:56,50
As they stop at an intersection, SOMEONE<Benjamin> frowns. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS353
00:56:54,00 --> 00:57:05,50
Buster casually lopes across the street in front of the SUV. With their jaws hanging open, SOMEONE<Dylan> and SOMEONE<Benjamin> stare 	at the lumbering grizzly. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS354
00:57:05,00 --> 00:57:15,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> bars an arm across SOMEONE's<Dylan's> chest as though protecting him from hitting the brakes hard. The bear moves 	to the driver side window. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS355
00:57:13,00 --> 00:57:25,50
The grizzly smells the window, then rises onto his hind legs and presses a paw to the glass. He drops back down to 	all fours and sniffs the side mirror. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS356
00:57:30,00 --> 00:57:42,50
With his eyes fixed on the escaped bear, SOMEONE<Benjamin> takes the phone from his son. A string of drool hangs from 	Buster's lips. As the bear trudges away, SOMEONE<Benjamin> makes a call. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS357
00:57:44,00 --> 00:57:49,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> pulls three tranquilizer rifles from a cabinet. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS358
00:57:53,00 --> 00:58:03,50
SOMEONE<Lily> searches with SOMEONE<Kelly>, SOMEONE<MacCready>, and SOMEONE<Robin>, who carry tranquilizer guns. Meanwhile, Buster roams a sunny 	woodland path. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS359
00:58:14,00 --> 00:58:21,50
Tranquilizer gun in hand, SOMEONE<Benjamin> freezes as he spots the grizzly on a hill. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS360
00:58:18,00 --> 00:58:24,50
Buster bounces on his forepaws and tosses his head. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS361
00:58:22,00 --> 00:58:26,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> steps closer. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS363
00:58:27,00 --> 00:58:31,50
The bear looks up at him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS364
00:58:28,00 --> 00:58:35,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> squints apprehensively as Buster lumbers toward him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS365
00:58:38,00 --> 00:58:41,50
The grizzly keeps approaching. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS366
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:42,50
The grizzly keeps approaching. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS367
00:58:43,00 --> 00:58:48,50
A swat from Buster sends the gun flying. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS368
00:58:51,00 --> 00:58:58,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> leans away from Buster's wide-open jaws. Air and saliva hit his face. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS370
00:58:57,00 --> 00:59:08,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> flinches, then watches as Buster lies down on the grass. SOMEONE<MacCready> and SOMEONE<Robin> close in with their guns 	ready. The others join them. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS371
00:59:17,00 --> 00:59:21,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> makes a call. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS372
00:59:33,00 --> 00:59:38,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> gazes down at the bear. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS373
00:59:49,00 --> 00:59:56,50
Later, Buster lies in a shelter in his enclosure. Its door drops shut. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS374
00:59:54,00 --> 00:59:58,50
Now with SOMEONE<Benjamin>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS375
00:59:59,00 --> 01:00:04,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> gives an unhappy look. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS376
01:00:01,00 --> 01:00:08,50
The vet swipes his credit card through a portable card reader and types in an amount. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS377
01:00:06,00 --> 01:00:10,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> peers at the screen. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS379
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:23,50
At the restaurant, SOMEONE<Lily> selects a song on the jukebox. Sitting at the bar, SOMEONE<Benjamin> stares off with a troubled look,

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS380
01:00:20,00 --> 01:00:27,50
then lifts his eyes to the tables where his staff members drink and chat. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS381
01:00:26,00 --> 01:00:32,50
SOMEONE<Lily> meets SOMEONE's<Dylan's> gaze and jerks her head. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS382
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:36,50
He follows her outside. As SOMEONE<Benjamin> watches his son leave, SOMEONE<Kelly> looks over at him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS383
01:00:34,00 --> 01:00:42,50
Her lips twitch in a thoughtful expression. The zoo owner clenches his jaw, then sucks in a breath. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS384
01:00:39,00 --> 01:00:43,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> raises her glass. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS385
01:00:54,00 --> 01:01:07,50
He raises his beer bottle in a toast, then shakes his head. Meanwhile, a flashlight's beam moves back and forth in 	the sky as SOMEONE<Lily> and SOMEONE<Dylan> lie side by side on the roof. SOMEONE<Lily> holds the light on her stomach. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS386
01:01:09,00 --> 01:01:16,50
She grins at him. He smiles back, then returns his gaze to the sky. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS387
01:01:15,00 --> 01:01:25,50
Lifting his head, he looks over and finds her swirling her fingers over the flashlight, as she stares at the sky with a 	dreamy expression. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS388
01:01:22,00 --> 01:01:30,50
A wide view shows the high-reaching beam, its glow shifting with SOMEONE's<Lily's> hand movements. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS389
01:01:27,00 --> 01:01:33,50
Later, SOMEONE<Kelly> and SOMEONE<Benjamin> stroll from the restaurant. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS390
01:01:58,00 --> 01:02:03,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> gives him a mildly intrigued look. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS391
01:02:06,00 --> 01:02:12,50
They stop walking. SOMEONE<Benjamin> smiles. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS392
01:02:14,00 --> 01:02:19,50
She half subdues her smile. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS393
01:02:39,00 --> 01:02:44,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> shifts his gaze to the zoo's grounds. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS394
01:02:44,00 --> 01:02:49,50
She eyes him sympathetically. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS395
01:02:55,00 --> 01:03:01,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> meets her friendly gaze and gives a thoughtful look. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS396
01:02:58,00 --> 01:03:06,50
Now in his bedroom, he wears an undershirt and sweatpants as he stands at his dresser, his hair damp. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS397
01:03:04,00 --> 01:03:10,50
He finds the old faded sweatshirt in the top drawer and takes it out. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS398
01:03:07,00 --> 01:03:11,50
He examines it. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS399
01:03:09,00 --> 01:03:17,50
Pulling it on, he lifts his eyes to a framed black-and-white photo of his wife on the dresser. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS400
01:03:14,00 --> 01:03:20,50
As he grabs a book and flops onto the bed, 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS401
01:03:17,00 --> 01:03:23,50
his hand brushes against the sweatshirt's front-pouch pocket. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS402
01:03:25,00 --> 01:03:33,50
Reaching inside, he finds a receipt for a safe deposit box bearing SOMEONE's<Katherine's> name. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS403
01:03:30,00 --> 01:03:35,50
He looks at the framed photo of her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS404
01:03:32,00 --> 01:03:40,50
Shot from the waist up during one of her pregnancies, she stands nude with one arm across her chest. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS405
01:03:38,00 --> 01:03:43,50
Daytime. At the Jaguar. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS406
01:03:43,00 --> 01:03:48,50
SOMEONE<Rhonda> faces the staff. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS407
01:04:10,00 --> 01:04:18,50
Now, SOMEONE<Benjamin> hurries into an open office of cubicles, past employees consulting clients. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS408
01:04:15,00 --> 01:04:20,50
He arrives at his brother's desk. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS409
01:04:21,00 --> 01:04:26,50
He hands SOMEONE<Duncan> an envelope. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS410
01:04:24,00 --> 01:04:33,50
SOMEONE<Duncan> grabs his coat. Later at a restaurant, SOMEONE<Duncan> sits across a table from his brother and reads bank statements. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS411
01:04:30,00 --> 01:04:38,50
His jaw drops as he examines some pie charts, and he gives SOMEONE<Benjamin> an amazed look. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS412
01:04:56,00 --> 01:05:01,50
He slides a letter from an envelope. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS413
01:05:01,00 --> 01:05:09,50
SOMEONE<Duncan> leafs through a lengthy handwritten letter. His gaze falls on two words in quotation marks. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS414
01:06:14,00 --> 01:06:18,50
Now at the zoo. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS415
01:06:17,00 --> 01:06:22,50
SOMEONE<Lily> brings a sandwich to SOMEONE<Dylan>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS416
01:06:20,00 --> 01:06:26,50
He continues to sketch as she sits beside him at a picnic table. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS417
01:06:23,00 --> 01:06:29,50
With a sad smile, she gazes at the oblivious boy. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS418
01:06:32,00 --> 01:06:36,50
He looks at her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS419
01:06:35,00 --> 01:06:39,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> resumes drawing. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS420
01:06:49,00 --> 01:06:56,50
He lifts his excited gaze to SOMEONE<Lily>. Struggling to remain composed, she nods. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS421
01:07:00,00 --> 01:07:04,50
He returns to his sketch. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS422
01:07:03,00 --> 01:07:10,50
As SOMEONE<Dylan> focuses on his drawing, SOMEONE<Lily> watches with heartbroken eyes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS423
01:07:11,00 --> 01:07:14,50
She gets up. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS424
01:07:16,00 --> 01:07:20,50
He gazes after her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS425
01:07:19,00 --> 01:07:25,50
Blinking back tears, SOMEONE<Lily> strides away. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS426
01:07:22,00 --> 01:07:28,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> shakes his head disbelievingly and smiles to himself. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS428
01:07:36,00 --> 01:07:40,50
they walk to the restaurant. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS429
01:07:40,00 --> 01:07:47,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Rhonda> gives a snide look as SOMEONE<Benjamin> faces the staff. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS430
01:07:52,00 --> 01:07:56,50
SOMEONE<MacCready> drops his knife. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS431
01:07:57,00 --> 01:08:01,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> glowers. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS432
01:08:03,00 --> 01:08:07,50
SOMEONE<Rhonda> scoffs. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS433
01:08:09,00 --> 01:08:16,50
He looks at SOMEONE<Duncan>, who sits at the bar and gives an encouraging nod. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS434
01:08:13,00 --> 01:08:18,50
SOMEONE<Lily> expectantly takes a steadying breath. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS435
01:08:16,00 --> 01:08:21,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> shifts her weight, her gaze intent. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS436
01:08:32,00 --> 01:08:36,50
SOMEONE<Duncan> nods. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS437
01:08:52,00 --> 01:08:57,50
SOMEONE<Lily> shares a quizzical glance with her cousin. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS438
01:08:55,00 --> 01:09:00,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> lowers his gaze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS439
01:08:59,00 --> 01:09:05,50
As he stares at the bank statements in his hands, SOMEONE<Duncan> bridles. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS440
01:09:03,00 --> 01:09:07,50
SOMEONE<Robin> wears a puzzled frown. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS441
01:09:05,00 --> 01:09:11,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> holds up the bank statements. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS442
01:09:11,00 --> 01:09:16,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> looks on, dazed. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS443
01:09:17,00 --> 01:09:22,50
SOMEONE<Duncan> gestures for a timeout. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS444
01:09:36,00 --> 01:09:42,50
SOMEONE<Robin> tears up and SOMEONE<Lily> grins from ear to ear. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS445
01:09:50,00 --> 01:09:57,50
Clapping, SOMEONE<MacCready> stands. Next to SOMEONE<Duncan>, SOMEONE<Nathan> applauds. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS446
01:10:05,00 --> 01:10:09,50
Smiling, she bows. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS447
01:10:12,00 --> 01:10:17,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> stifles a laugh. SOMEONE<Benjamin> grins at her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS448
01:10:16,00 --> 01:10:24,50
Pointing two fingers like a gun, SOMEONE<Duncan> mimes aiming it into his own mouth and pulling the trigger. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS449
01:10:21,00 --> 01:10:36,50
Now, SOMEONE<MacCready> and SOMEONE<Robin> set towering posts near Buster's enclosure. On a monthly calendar, a hand checks off 	the 1st of June. SOMEONE<Lily> mounts a sign in front of a capuchin enclosure. Later, the hand crosses off June 10th. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS450
01:10:34,00 --> 01:10:40,50
As a circular saw cuts a pole, otters watch from a rock. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS451
01:10:37,00 --> 01:10:48,50
On the calendar, the hand Xs out the 19th, then adds to a doodle at the bottom. Now, SOMEONE<MacCready> cuts through bars 	on Buster's enclosure. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS454
01:10:53,00 --> 01:11:04,50
Sitting outside, SOMEONE<Dylan> draws in his sketchbook. He glances around, then checks his watch and gazes down a path for 	Lily. Seeing no one, he gives a disappointed look. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS455
01:11:02,00 --> 01:11:11,50
Later, SOMEONE<Benjamin> and SOMEONE<Kelly> assemble wrought-iron fencing around SOMEONE's<Solomon's> enclosure. She eyes his knit cap. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS456
01:11:19,00 --> 01:11:24,50
She lifts her brow high. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS457
01:11:24,00 --> 01:11:32,50
A hand checks off June 28th. Now at Home Depot with SOMEONE<Rosie>, SOMEONE<Benjamin> grabs an item. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS458
01:11:53,00 --> 01:12:00,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> grabs onto the back of his belt and he puts an arm around her. Later, they check out. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS459
01:12:06,00 --> 01:12:10,50
She eyes his weathered credit card. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS460
01:12:49,00 --> 01:12:54,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> signs his receipt. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS461
01:12:53,00 --> 01:12:57,50
He starts to leave. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS462
01:12:57,00 --> 01:13:02,50
He takes her hand as she offers his bag. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS463
01:13:04,00 --> 01:13:08,50
At the zoo. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS464
01:13:08,00 --> 01:13:15,50
He replaces a bulb over Spar's cage. The tiger hangs his head. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS465
01:13:30,00 --> 01:13:39,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> enters the cage area, unnoticed by SOMEONE<Benjamin>. The owner climbs down from his ladder and faces Spar. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS466
01:13:42,00 --> 01:13:47,50
Spar bares his teeth. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS467
01:13:44,00 --> 01:13:49,50
He glances away, then opens his mouth wide. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS468
01:13:54,00 --> 01:13:59,50
As he gazes sadly at the tiger, 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS469
01:13:56,00 --> 01:14:02,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> observes from the end of the cage row. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS470
01:14:10,00 --> 01:14:15,50
Spar meets his pleading gaze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS471
01:14:13,00 --> 01:14:17,50
Spar looks away. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS472
01:14:17,00 --> 01:14:25,50
As SOMEONE<Benjamin> tries to hold the tiger's gaze, he notices SOMEONE<Kelly> watching them. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS473
01:14:24,00 --> 01:14:30,50
Standing, he grabs his tool bag and strides past her to the door. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS474
01:14:29,00 --> 01:14:34,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> stares after him as he hurries out. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS475
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:38,50
Now, SOMEONE<Benjamin> sits at the kitchen island with a laptop in front of him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS476
01:14:35,00 --> 01:14:40,50
Opening it, he puts on his glasses. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS477
01:14:37,00 --> 01:14:45,50
He moves the cursor down the desktop photo of SOMEONE<Rosie> and SOMEONE<Dylan> to a row of icons at the bottom. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS478
01:14:43,00 --> 01:14:49,50
The cursor moves along the monitor's dock to the iPhoto application. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS480
01:14:47,00 --> 01:14:56,50
Clicking it, SOMEONE<Benjamin> opens an album displaying thumbnail images of family photos. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS481
01:14:54,00 --> 01:14:57,50
He opens the first one, then selects Full Screen. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS482
01:15:02,00 --> 01:15:09,50
He glides the cursor across a smiling photo of SOMEONE<Katherine> with trees behind her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS483
01:15:07,00 --> 01:15:13,50
A lens flare obscures her angelic face with brilliant sunlight. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS484
01:15:11,00 --> 01:15:18,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> hovers the cursor over an arrow icon to continue to the next image. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS485
01:15:19,00 --> 01:15:27,50
His cursor remains on the icon as he gazes at the sun-blanched photo of his wife. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS486
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:36,50
He blinks his languishing eyes and his lips tighten into a frown. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS487
01:15:34,00 --> 01:15:39,50
He removes his glasses and pulls the laptop shut. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS488
01:15:40,00 --> 01:15:47,50
Now SOMEONE<Benjamin> runs to Spar's enclosure, joining SOMEONE<Kelly>, SOMEONE<Robin>, and SOMEONE<Lily>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS489
01:15:59,00 --> 01:16:03,50
He heads to the gate. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS490
01:16:10,00 --> 01:16:15,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> halts and faces the others. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS491
01:16:18,00 --> 01:16:24,50
Catching his breath, SOMEONE<Benjamin> looks in at Spar. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS492
01:16:21,00 --> 01:16:27,50
The aging tiger wearily meets his gaze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS493
01:16:24,00 --> 01:16:29,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> turns back to the others. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS494
01:16:28,00 --> 01:16:32,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> and SOMEONE<Robin> are taken aback. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS495
01:16:34,00 --> 01:16:41,50
As SOMEONE<Benjamin> regards Spar uncertainly, SOMEONE<MacCready> arrives. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS496
01:16:57,00 --> 01:17:01,50
SOMEONE<MacCready> uses his radio. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS497
01:17:01,00 --> 01:17:07,50
Later, the zoo staffers bang on buckets, pots, and pans. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS498
01:17:05,00 --> 01:17:10,50
Spar stays up on his boulder. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS499
01:17:09,00 --> 01:17:14,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> joins in on the yelling. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS500
01:17:27,00 --> 01:17:32,50
Spar lazily looks over from his boulder. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS501
01:17:39,00 --> 01:17:44,50
Spar gets to his feet. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS502
01:17:46,00 --> 01:17:51,50
He carefully makes his way down. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS503
01:17:55,00 --> 01:18:01,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> lowers his cupped hands from his mouth. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS504
01:17:58,00 --> 01:18:02,50
SOMEONE<Lily> lifts her brow. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS505
01:18:01,00 --> 01:18:07,50
SOMEONE<Nathan> and a tall zoo worker swap concerned looks. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS506
01:18:04,00 --> 01:18:09,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> leans heavily on a guard rail. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS507
01:18:06,00 --> 01:18:12,50
As he glances toward SOMEONE<Kelly>, she looks away. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS508
01:18:09,00 --> 01:18:14,50
He abruptly turns and walks off. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS509
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:15,50
SOMEONE<off> hurries after him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS510
01:19:09,00 --> 01:19:13,50
She storms up the footpath. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS511
01:19:11,00 --> 01:19:16,50
She halts and wheels back on SOMEONE<Benjamin>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS512
01:19:20,00 --> 01:19:26,50
She marches off, leaving SOMEONE<Benjamin> with his mouth agape. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS513
01:19:27,00 --> 01:19:32,50
Now, SOMEONE<Rosie> looks down at a peahen. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS514
01:19:32,00 --> 01:19:37,50
The penned bird sits on a nest. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS515
01:19:34,00 --> 01:19:38,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> arrives. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS516
01:19:52,00 --> 01:19:56,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> sketches on the porch. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS517
01:19:54,00 --> 01:20:02,50
Now at dusk, light shines softly from the house. SOMEONE<Rosie> brings a pizza box into the dining room. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS518
01:20:03,00 --> 01:20:08,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> brings plates and placemats. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS519
01:20:06,00 --> 01:20:11,50
At the table, SOMEONE<Dylan> closes his sketchbook. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS520
01:20:10,00 --> 01:20:14,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> sets the table. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS521
01:20:26,00 --> 01:20:31,50
She pats his hand and steps away. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS522
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:33,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> brings napkins and a plate of utensils. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS523
01:20:31,00 --> 01:20:38,50
Later, SOMEONE<Kelly> takes the little girl upstairs, followed by SOMEONE<Dylan> and SOMEONE<Leon>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS524
01:20:35,00 --> 01:20:42,50
We watch through a window as SOMEONE<Rosie> ushers the zookeeper into her room. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS525
01:20:39,00 --> 01:20:45,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> follows at a leisurely swagger, his sketchbook in hand. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS526
01:20:43,00 --> 01:20:49,50
Later, SOMEONE<Kelly> sits on the porch, sipping peacefully from a mug. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS527
01:20:46,00 --> 01:20:51,50
SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> SUV pulls up. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS528
01:20:50,00 --> 01:20:58,50
The grieving widower climbs the porch steps and takes a seat in a chair beside SOMEONE<Kelly>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS529
01:20:55,00 --> 01:21:01,50
SOMEONE<Leon> lies near her feet, watching them placidly. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS530
01:20:59,00 --> 01:21:11,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> takes SOMEONE's<Kelly's> hand in his. She studies his distant ponderous expression, glances away for a moment, then 	gives him a warm smile. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS531
01:21:09,00 --> 01:21:15,50
Looking down, she watches him adjust his grip on her hand. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS532
01:21:13,00 --> 01:21:20,50
She glances at his face again, then gazes off with a gentle smile. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS533
01:21:18,00 --> 01:21:25,50
He releases her hand and they both sit quietly, staring into the darkness. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS534
01:21:26,00 --> 01:21:30,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> faces him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS535
01:21:27,00 --> 01:21:33,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> meets her attentive gaze, then shakes his head wistfully. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS536
01:22:34,00 --> 01:22:39,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> gives an understanding nod. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS537
01:22:37,00 --> 01:22:42,50
She offers a gentle sympathetic smile. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS539
01:23:02,00 --> 01:23:06,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> listens in. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS540
01:23:05,00 --> 01:23:12,50
Frowning, SOMEONE<Kelly> releases a deep breath and leans forward in her seat. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS541
01:23:28,00 --> 01:23:34,50
A brief wistful smile flits across SOMEONE's<Kelly's> features. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS542
01:23:31,00 --> 01:23:36,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> gives a stoic shrug. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS543
01:23:36,00 --> 01:23:43,50
He mimics Ferris' gesture, causing SOMEONE<Kelly> to chuckle. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS544
01:23:45,00 --> 01:23:52,50
She regards him compassionately, then gets up, pats his leg, and looks him in the eye. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS545
01:23:54,00 --> 01:23:58,50
She moves past him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS546
01:23:58,00 --> 01:24:03,50
He gazes after her gratefully. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS547
01:24:00,00 --> 01:24:07,50
Going into the house, he finds SOMEONE<Dylan> sitting at the foot of the stairs, in tears. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS548
01:24:22,00 --> 01:24:27,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> follows him upstairs. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS549
01:25:44,00 --> 01:25:50,50
His father stares at his tearful savage glare. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS550
01:25:48,00 --> 01:25:53,50
SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> shoulders sag in a weary sigh. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS551
01:25:51,00 --> 01:25:57,50
Pressing his lips together, he leans against the banister railing. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS552
01:26:18,00 --> 01:26:24,50
Under his father's imploring gaze, SOMEONE<Dylan> swallows. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS553
01:26:30,00 --> 01:26:34,50
He shuts himself in his room. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS554
01:26:32,00 --> 01:26:37,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> knocks on the door. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS555
01:26:40,00 --> 01:26:45,50
He turns to find SOMEONE<Rosie> coming out of her room. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS556
01:26:45,00 --> 01:26:51,50
Now, the sun peeks over distant trees. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS557
01:26:48,00 --> 01:26:57,50
A vulture's sharp-beaked face and white fluffy collar fill our view as it shifts its keen gaze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS558
01:26:54,00 --> 01:27:00,50
A kangaroo hops gracefully around its grassy enclosure. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS559
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:05,50
Near a watchtower, SOMEONE<Dylan> rests his arms on a fence and gazes off pensively. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS560
01:27:03,00 --> 01:27:09,50
Now, Spar lies in his backroom cage. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS561
01:27:09,00 --> 01:27:14,50
He stares out at SOMEONE<Benjamin>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS562
01:27:11,00 --> 01:27:18,50
The zoo owner takes a seat on the floor, leaning back against the wall. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS563
01:27:15,00 --> 01:27:21,50
Spar relaxes onto his side in a shaft of sunlight. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS564
01:27:23,00 --> 01:27:29,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> holds the animal in his melancholy gaze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS565
01:27:26,00 --> 01:27:32,50
At the far end of the room, a windowed door opens. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS566
01:27:30,00 --> 01:27:37,50
Turning, SOMEONE<Benjamin> finds his son staring in at him timidly. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS567
01:27:34,00 --> 01:27:39,50
Clad in a red hooded sweatshirt and jeans, SOMEONE<Dylan> comes in and shuts the door. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS569
01:27:39,00 --> 01:27:45,50
The young teen moves through shafts of sunlight 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS570
01:27:42,00 --> 01:27:48,50
pouring in from the high windows as he approaches SOMEONE<Benjamin>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS571
01:27:45,00 --> 01:27:55,50
Sitting beside him on the floor, he glances at his father's grief-stricken expression, then looks to the cage. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS572
01:27:52,00 --> 01:27:59,50
On the other side of the grating, Spar lies with his eyes half-closed. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS574
01:27:58,00 --> 01:28:04,50
Beneath his striped pelt, his rib cage rises and falls, slowly. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS575
01:28:24,00 --> 01:28:30,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> gives his son a loving sidelong stare. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS576
01:28:51,00 --> 01:28:58,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> gives a receptive nod and SOMEONE<Benjamin> returns his gaze to Spar. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS578
01:28:57,00 --> 01:29:01,50
The teen releases a deep pent-up breath, then swallows. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS580
01:29:04,00 --> 01:29:11,50
Blinking thoughtfully, SOMEONE<Benjamin> purses his lips tightly and nods. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS581
01:29:12,00 --> 01:29:18,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> regards his father with a faint understanding smile. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS582
01:29:30,00 --> 01:29:36,50
Spar slumbers peacefully in his shaft of sunlight. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS583
01:29:34,00 --> 01:29:39,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> faces his father earnestly. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS584
01:29:43,00 --> 01:29:49,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> faces his son with a furrowed brow. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS585
01:29:46,00 --> 01:29:51,50
The boy gazes solemnly into the cage. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS586
01:29:49,00 --> 01:29:55,50
Spar opens his eyes a slit and blinks heavily. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS587
01:29:53,00 --> 01:30:00,50
Later, SOMEONE<Benjamin> bites his lip as he walks outside with SOMEONE<Dylan>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS588
01:29:58,00 --> 01:30:04,50
He approaches SOMEONE<Kelly> and gives a resigned nod. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS589
01:30:07,00 --> 01:30:13,50
She watches them walk off together down the sun-dabbled footpath. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS590
01:30:11,00 --> 01:30:19,50
Seeing SOMEONE<Benjamin> throw an arm around his son's shoulder, she takes a deep warm-hearted breath. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS591
01:30:20,00 --> 01:30:27,50
As they near a bend in the path, SOMEONE's<Dylan's> father gives him a playful shove. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS592
01:30:24,00 --> 01:30:31,50
The boy staggers sideways, then shoves him back good-naturedly. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS593
01:30:30,00 --> 01:30:42,50
At night, SOMEONE<Benjamin> tucks a blanket around his sleeping son. He strokes the teen's smooth hair, then notices a stack 	of drawings on a bedside table and picks them up. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS594
01:30:44,00 --> 01:30:51,50
The top sketch depicts a human figure with taloned hands and a spiraling worm-like head. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS595
01:30:49,00 --> 01:30:59,50
Flipping through the drawings, SOMEONE<Benjamin> next finds a detailed illustration of a fly with pincers and a toothy maniacal 	grin. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS596
01:30:56,00 --> 01:31:02,50
The father's brow knits and he glances at his son. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS597
01:30:59,00 --> 01:31:07,50
Continuing to the next drawing, he finds a portrait of Spar's face. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS598
01:31:04,00 --> 01:31:12,50
The minimalistic rendering captures the tiger's characteristically warm, intelligent gaze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS599
01:31:10,00 --> 01:31:16,50
SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> lips part as he takes in the evocative image. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS600
01:31:13,00 --> 01:31:19,50
He looks back at his sleeping son and beams proudly. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS601
01:31:17,00 --> 01:31:25,50
Taking a deep breath, SOMEONE<Benjamin> returns his gaze to the portrait, and blinks back tears. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS602
01:31:25,00 --> 01:31:32,50
Now at his laptop, he clicks an arrow on his iPhoto application. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS603
01:31:29,00 --> 01:31:37,50
The image of a sun-haloed SOMEONE<Katherine> changes to a picture of her smiling in the bright daylight. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS604
01:31:35,00 --> 01:31:41,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> sits cross-legged on the kitchen floor with the computer on his lap. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS605
01:31:39,00 --> 01:31:46,50
He clicks to the next image, which shows him and SOMEONE<Katherine> sharing a kiss. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS606
01:31:43,00 --> 01:31:48,50
The widower smiles wistfully. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS607
01:31:45,00 --> 01:31:49,50
More images follow. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS608
01:31:47,00 --> 01:31:52,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> facing a sunny window. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS609
01:31:49,00 --> 01:31:56,50
She and SOMEONE standing in their wedding clothes beside a single-propeller airplane, 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS610
01:31:53,00 --> 01:31:59,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> lying on a bed with a newborn infant. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS611
01:31:56,00 --> 01:32:02,50
SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> breath grows ragged and his chin quivers. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS612
01:32:00,00 --> 01:32:06,50
The next picture shows a black-and-white-photo print lying on a table. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS613
01:32:03,00 --> 01:32:09,50
It features SOMEONE<Katherine> holding a glass of red wine. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS614
01:32:07,00 --> 01:32:14,50
In the next photo, the smiling beauty stands in the snow in an ankle-length coat. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS615
01:32:11,00 --> 01:32:16,50
More images follow. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS616
01:32:13,00 --> 01:32:18,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> grinning in a tutu. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS617
01:32:15,00 --> 01:32:24,50
SOMEONE<Katherine> making a goofy face behind a seated SOMEONE<Benjamin>. A younger SOMEONE<Dylan> giving a thumbs-up on the beach. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS618
01:32:21,00 --> 01:32:25,50
SOMEONE by a lake, 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS619
01:32:22,00 --> 01:32:28,50
her hair tumbling around her shoulders. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS620
01:32:25,00 --> 01:32:30,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> stares tearfully at the photo. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS621
01:32:28,00 --> 01:32:33,50
The next shows SOMEONE<Katherine> kissing his cheek. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS622
01:32:30,00 --> 01:32:37,50
In another, she lies asleep in bed, her shoulders bare. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS623
01:32:34,00 --> 01:32:42,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> imagines her opening her eyes, her chest rises and falls beneath the sheet. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS624
01:32:40,00 --> 01:32:46,50
A tear escapes SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> eye and he gives a brief smile. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS625
01:32:44,00 --> 01:32:57,50
In another picture, SOMEONE<Dylan> plays with SOMEONE<Leon> as a puppy. In a field, SOMEONE<Katherine> stands on one leg, with her arms spread, 	as her children look on. Another tear rolls down SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> cheek. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS626
01:32:55,00 --> 01:33:13,50
Looking up from the computer, he remembers taking photos in the field as his wife and children frolic around him. 	Later, they play a game of tag. SOMEONE<Benjamin> grins at the memory. In the field, SOMEONE<Katherine> and SOMEONE<Rosie> spread their arms 	like wings as they run circles around him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS627
01:33:10,00 --> 01:33:20,50
Back in the present, SOMEONE<Benjamin> beams joyfully as he visualizes his wife and children playing before him in the dimly lit 	kitchen. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS628
01:33:18,00 --> 01:33:31,50
Back in the field, SOMEONE's<Katherine's> white spotted sundress flutters as she leads her children in tighter circles around her 	husband. In the kitchen, SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> glasses show their dancing reflections. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS629
01:33:29,00 --> 01:33:36,50
He wets his lips as he stares longingly at the passing vision of his wife. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS630
01:33:33,00 --> 01:33:40,50
In the field, the family gathers in a group embrace around him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS631
01:33:37,00 --> 01:33:45,50
Later, SOMEONE<Katherine> reclines across his lap and SOMEONE<Rosie> leans against his side. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS632
01:33:42,00 --> 01:33:50,50
Later still, SOMEONE<Benjamin> holds his wife in his arms as she reaches out to scratch SOMEONE's<Dylan's> back. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS633
01:33:48,00 --> 01:33:54,50
In the kitchen, the widower lowers his overwhelmed gaze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS634
01:33:51,00 --> 01:33:56,50
He removes his reading glasses, 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS635
01:33:53,00 --> 01:33:59,50
the skin around his eyes glistening with traces of tears 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS636
01:33:57,00 --> 01:34:05,50
Now, a blurred image sharpens into focus to reveal the gnarled branches of a California oak. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS637
01:34:02,00 --> 01:34:09,50
At the tiger's outdoor enclosure, SOMEONE<Benjamin> finishes posting a memorial plaque. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS639
01:34:07,00 --> 01:34:17,50
It reads, Spar, 1993 to 2010, Our Unforgettable Friend and features a photo illustration of the Bengal tiger. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS640
01:34:27,00 --> 01:34:34,50
As SOMEONE steps away, our view drifts closer to the touching memorial 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS641
01:34:32,00 --> 01:34:37,50
passing through patches of flared sunlight. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS642
01:34:34,00 --> 01:34:41,50
Elsewhere in the zoo, two wolves forage within their enclosure. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS643
01:34:38,00 --> 01:34:43,50
A horned owl turns its head. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS644
01:34:40,00 --> 01:34:45,50
Two black boars trot around in their pen. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS645
01:34:43,00 --> 01:34:51,50
Grass sticks out from a tortoise's mouth as it crawls over the ground. A peahen turns her head. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS646
01:34:48,00 --> 01:34:54,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> kneels at the edge of SOMEONE's<Lucy's> pen in front of the house. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS647
01:34:51,00 --> 01:34:56,50
A chick hatches from an egg. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS648
01:34:55,00 --> 01:35:02,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Benjamin> intercepts SOMEONE<Dylan> as he comes downstairs. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS649
01:35:05,00 --> 01:35:09,50
He unrolls a poster. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS650
01:35:08,00 --> 01:35:14,50
An advertisement for the zoo features SOMEONE's<Dylan's> portrait of Spar at its center. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS651
01:35:13,00 --> 01:35:17,50
The teen's eyes light up. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS652
01:35:20,00 --> 01:35:25,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> chuckles, overcome with SOMEONE<joy>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS653
01:35:27,00 --> 01:35:32,50
They share a smile. SOMEONE<Rosie> comes running in. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS654
01:35:42,00 --> 01:35:50,50
A boxy older-style Mercedes pulls up nearby. SOMEONE<Duncan> gets out, wearing sunglasses. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS655
01:35:53,00 --> 01:35:57,50
He takes off his shades. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS656
01:36:03,00 --> 01:36:08,50
He clicks a remote, popping his trunk. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS657
01:36:34,00 --> 01:36:44,50
Now in his enclosure, Buster paws at a tray of SOMEONE<haddock> curiously. Outside the Jaguar, SOMEONE<Kelly> squeegees a window. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS658
01:36:41,00 --> 01:36:50,50
SOMEONE<Nathan> strides past and takes a screwdriver to a water fountain. It squirts him in the face. SOMEONE<Duncan> uses a leaf 	blower. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS659
01:36:52,00 --> 01:36:57,50
Crystal paints with SOMEONE<Rosie> and SOMEONE<MacCready>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS660
01:36:56,00 --> 01:37:06,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> gazes longingly at SOMEONE<Lily>. Now at the park entrance, SOMEONE<MacCready>, SOMEONE<Nathan>, SOMEONE<Kelly>, and SOMEONE<Benjamin> lift a sign to an entryway frame. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS661
01:37:03,00 --> 01:37:15,50
Bearing SOMEONE's<Dylan's> portrait of Spar as its central logo, it reads Rosemoor Animal Park Adventure. SOMEONE<Kelly> and SOMEONE<Benjamin> 	hold it in place while SOMEONE<Robin> attaches it. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS662
01:37:12,00 --> 01:37:22,50
Now, a spotless sweatless SOMEONE<Duncan> strides past SOMEONE<Benjamin> and SOMEONE<MacCready>, with an ax and an overly confident air. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS663
01:37:31,00 --> 01:37:36,50
Now, everyone assembles. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS665
01:37:48,00 --> 01:37:54,50
Ferris' truck pulls up nearby. Beaming, SOMEONE<Kelly> pats SOMEONE's<Lily's> back. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS666
01:37:52,00 --> 01:37:57,50
As the pretty girl grins, SOMEONE<Dylan> sneaks a look at her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS667
01:38:05,00 --> 01:38:11,50
SOMEONE<Ferris> wears a khaki safari-style vest over his suit. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS668
01:38:10,00 --> 01:38:16,50
His long hair in a ponytail, SOMEONE<MacCready> shakes his hand. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS669
01:38:16,00 --> 01:38:21,50
They grip each other's hands. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS670
01:38:22,00 --> 01:38:32,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> smiles at SOMEONE<Benjamin> and nods. The zoo owner gives a bewildered shake of his head. Now, SOMEONE<Ferris> faces a 	schedule on a whiteboard. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS671
01:38:32,00 --> 01:38:42,50
Later, as SOMEONE<Kelly> and SOMEONE<Benjamin> look on, SOMEONE<Ferris> picks up a single piece of straw. Scrutinizing it, he turns it in the light, 	then gives it a sniff. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS672
01:38:42,00 --> 01:38:49,50
He eyes his host disapprovingly, flicks the straw away, and moves on. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS673
01:38:46,00 --> 01:38:51,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> and SOMEONE<Kelly> follow worriedly. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS674
01:38:48,00 --> 01:38:54,50
Now, SOMEONE<Ferris> extends his electric measuring tape along a railing. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS675
01:38:52,00 --> 01:39:00,50
Later, he stands on a building's corrugated metal roof. He bounces lightly, then tries another spot. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS676
01:38:57,00 --> 01:39:04,50
Now, he peers closely at a surface and sets a miniature level on it. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS677
01:39:01,00 --> 01:39:08,50
In its clear tube of fluid, a bubble hovers in the center. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS678
01:39:05,00 --> 01:39:13,50
Later, as SOMEONE<Ferris> pushes a measuring wheel over the footpath, a camel walks beside him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS679
01:39:10,00 --> 01:39:20,50
Now, he stands at an ankle-deep pool as otters swim around him. Later, he taps on the enclosure's glass. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS680
01:39:17,00 --> 01:39:23,50
Now, SOMEONE<Kelly> arrives at SOMEONE's<Solomon's> enclosure and opens the gate. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS681
01:39:23,00 --> 01:39:33,50
She pauses and frowns. Glancing around, she pulls the gate shut and hurriedly takes a key from a ring on her belt. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS682
01:39:31,00 --> 01:39:37,50
Opening the gate again, she turns the key extending a deadbolt. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS683
01:39:35,00 --> 01:39:43,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> turns the key back, and tries closing the gate, but the extended deadbolt prevents it from latching shut. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS684
01:39:40,00 --> 01:39:47,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> turns the key persistently, but finds the deadbolt stuck. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS686
01:39:52,00 --> 01:40:01,50
Lying on a rock, SOMEONE<Solomon> stands and faces her. She takes out her walkie. At Buster's enclosure, SOMEONE<Ferris> makes notes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS687
01:40:04,00 --> 01:40:09,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> turns off his walkie-talkie. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS688
01:40:08,00 --> 01:40:15,50
SOMEONE<Ferris> leads him off. At the malfunctioning gate, SOMEONE<Kelly> struggles with the key and the lock. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS689
01:40:15,00 --> 01:40:23,50
The lion gets down off his rock and takes a few steps towards SOMEONE<Kelly>, holding the gate shut from the outside. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS690
01:40:34,00 --> 01:40:40,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Ferris> leads SOMEONE<Benjamin> and his kids through a grove. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS691
01:40:46,00 --> 01:40:51,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> dashes off to the far side of the enclosure. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS692
01:40:51,00 --> 01:40:56,50
SOMEONE<MacCready> takes off his jacket and points. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS693
01:40:59,00 --> 01:41:07,50
The lion turns. As he takes a step toward SOMEONE<Kelly>, SOMEONE<MacCready> enters the enclosure behind him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS694
01:41:07,00 --> 01:41:11,50
He takes out his tools. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS695
01:41:09,00 --> 01:41:12,50
With SOMEONE<Ferris>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS696
01:41:15,00 --> 01:41:25,50
In the lion enclosure, SOMEONE<MacCready> shakily removes the gate's knob-shaped handle. Safely outside it, SOMEONE<Kelly> jumps up 	and down. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS697
01:41:25,00 --> 01:41:30,50
SOMEONE<MacCready> peeks over his shoulder. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS698
01:41:35,00 --> 01:41:40,50
He slams the gate on his fingers. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS699
01:41:43,00 --> 01:41:52,50
SOMEONE<Solomon> faces SOMEONE<MacCready> and stalks toward him. His back to the lion, the Scotsman reassembles the lock. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS700
01:41:52,00 --> 01:41:57,50
SOMEONE<MacCready> faces SOMEONE<Solomon> and points. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS701
01:42:00,00 --> 01:42:04,50
The lion licks his chops. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS702
01:42:05,00 --> 01:42:11,50
SOMEONE<MacCready> finishes the lock, slips out, and bolts the gate. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS703
01:42:11,00 --> 01:42:18,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> primps her hair, then wheels around to meet SOMEONE<Ferris> with a big smile. SOMEONE<MacCready> joins her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS704
01:42:18,00 --> 01:42:25,50
SOMEONE<Ferris> peers into the enclosure, then turns his suspicious gaze on the others. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS705
01:42:22,00 --> 01:42:27,50
He takes out his electric measuring tape. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS706
01:42:24,00 --> 01:42:31,50
With a scowl at SOMEONE<Benjamin> and SOMEONE<Kelly>, he extends it over the moat. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS707
01:42:28,00 --> 01:42:34,50
Now, a clipboard bears a document headed, 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS708
01:42:31,00 --> 01:42:35,50
Final Inspection Report. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS709
01:42:33,00 --> 01:42:40,50
SOMEONE<Ferris> holds a pen between two checkboxes labeled, Denied and Approved. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS710
01:42:37,00 --> 01:42:44,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin>, his kids, and the zoo staff stand before him as he considers. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS711
01:42:41,00 --> 01:42:47,50
A smirk plays on Ferris' lips as he regards the staff. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS712
01:42:44,00 --> 01:42:49,50
He shakes his head and aims his pen. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS713
01:42:56,00 --> 01:43:05,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> stares at his daughter, who looks up sweetly at the inspector. SOMEONE<MacCready> eyes SOMEONE<Ferris> sheepishly. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS714
01:43:02,00 --> 01:43:09,50
Facing SOMEONE<Rosie>, the inspector lifts his brow, smirks, and marks the report. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS715
01:43:10,00 --> 01:43:16,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> resignedly approaches SOMEONE<Ferris>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS716
01:43:13,00 --> 01:43:20,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> blinks and lowers her forlorn gaze. As SOMEONE<Ferris> holds out the report,

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS717
01:43:17,00 --> 01:43:21,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> hangs her head. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS718
01:43:21,00 --> 01:43:27,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> looks down at the report, then holds it up to the others. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS719
01:43:29,00 --> 01:43:36,50
SOMEONE<MacCready> shakes SOMEONE's<Rosie's> hand. As SOMEONE<Ferris> starts to go, SOMEONE<Benjamin> stops him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS720
01:43:42,00 --> 01:43:50,50
SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> smile fades. He offers a terse professional nod to the inspector, who reciprocates. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS721
01:43:48,00 --> 01:43:54,50
SOMEONE<Ferris> heads off, then stops to look back at the jubilant group. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS722
01:43:51,00 --> 01:43:57,50
Among them, SOMEONE<Duncan> embraces SOMEONE<Benjamin> and SOMEONE<Dylan>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS723
01:43:54,00 --> 01:43:59,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> scoops up SOMEONE<Rosie> and hugs SOMEONE<Kelly>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS724
01:43:57,00 --> 01:44:01,50
SOMEONE<Ferris> shakes his head and leaves. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS725
01:43:59,00 --> 01:44:05,50
Now, at the Jaguar Restaurant, SOMEONE<Duncan> joins his brother at the bar. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS726
01:44:20,00 --> 01:44:26,50
SOMEONE<MacCready> spits out his scotch bottle's cork and holds up a glass. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS727
01:44:27,00 --> 01:44:33,50
He fills SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> and SOMEONE's<Duncan's> whisky glasses, then steps away. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS728
01:44:38,00 --> 01:44:43,50
He jerks his thumb at the zoo staff. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS729
01:44:45,00 --> 01:44:49,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> lowers his gaze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS730
01:44:47,00 --> 01:44:52,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> turns and SOMEONE<Duncan> looks up. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS731
01:44:50,00 --> 01:44:59,50
Outside, raindrops land in Buster's enormous footprint. The storm quickly picks up, turning the dirt into mud. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS732
01:44:56,00 --> 01:45:07,50
Water drips off a leafy branch. At the ground's entrance, an archway reading Rosemoor Wildlife Park stands in the 	heavy downpour. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS733
01:45:04,00 --> 01:45:10,50
Now wearing a hooded raincoat, SOMEONE<Dylan> walks on the dirt road. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS734
01:45:08,00 --> 01:45:15,50
Passing the restaurant, he doubles back and reads a new illuminated sign in the window. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS735
01:45:12,00 --> 01:45:17,50
If you love me, let me know. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS736
01:45:14,00 --> 01:45:21,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> smiles wistfully at the words, nods, and dashes off. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS737
01:45:18,00 --> 01:45:25,50
Now a rain-drenched window shows SOMEONE<Lily> working leather in her room. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS738
01:45:22,00 --> 01:45:26,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> approaches. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS739
01:45:32,00 --> 01:45:38,50
The pretty teen puts down her work, kneels at the window, and lifts the sash. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS740
01:45:47,00 --> 01:45:53,50
SOMEONE<Lily> solemnly shakes her head, then yields a smile. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS741
01:46:11,00 --> 01:46:17,50
SOMEONE's<Lily's> mirthful grin vanishes and she stares at SOMEONE<Dylan>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS742
01:46:14,00 --> 01:46:21,50
Panting, he stares back, then cracks an undaunted smile. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS743
01:46:18,00 --> 01:46:25,50
SOMEONE's<Lily's> large blue eyes fill with tears and she beams back at him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS744
01:46:22,00 --> 01:46:35,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> wraps his arms around her and they share a warm heartfelt embrace. The teen boy leans diagonally into SOMEONE's<Lily's> 	window, his feet planted in a flowerbed as he holds her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS745
01:46:32,00 --> 01:46:37,50
Now, a TV weather report. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS746
01:46:58,00 --> 01:47:06,50
Now, rain drips from a sign reading Zookeepers Only. Water streams from the barn roof. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS747
01:47:03,00 --> 01:47:17,50
By a fence, raindrops pelt two full water bowls. In Buster's enclosure, his enormous footprint is now a paw-shaped 	puddle. In another enclosure, monkeys gather on a branch. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS748
01:47:14,00 --> 01:47:22,50
In his living room, SOMEONE<Benjamin> reads in an armchair while SOMEONE<Dylan> sketches nearby. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS749
01:47:19,00 --> 01:47:27,50
Seated at the coffee table, SOMEONE<Rosie> colors. A glass of milk stands within her reach. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS750
01:47:24,00 --> 01:47:30,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> eyes the unrelenting rainfall outside. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS751
01:47:27,00 --> 01:47:35,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE<MacCready> opens a flask in his living quarters and finds the vessel empty. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS752
01:47:32,00 --> 01:47:38,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> leaves a building and uses her walkie-talkie. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS753
01:47:40,00 --> 01:47:45,50
The bearcat eats from SOMEONE's<Duncan's> hand. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS754
01:47:45,00 --> 01:47:50,50
A zebra hoofs through mud. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS755
01:47:47,00 --> 01:47:53,50
Two tigers gaze out from windows in the big-cat house. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS756
01:47:50,00 --> 01:47:55,50
Crystal licks rain from her fur. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS757
01:47:53,00 --> 01:48:02,50
In an open-air shelter, SOMEONE<Lily> cuts potatoes into chunks, and then puts them in a scale's bowl, and reads the 	measurement. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS758
01:47:59,00 --> 01:48:07,50
In town, in spite of the downpour, SOMEONE<Dylan> holds a zoo poster up to a bulletin board. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS759
01:48:05,00 --> 01:48:10,50
SOMEONE<Duncan> staples it in place with clownish aggression. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS760
01:48:08,00 --> 01:48:15,50
On the calendar, a young hand marks an X through July 6th. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS761
01:48:12,00 --> 01:48:18,50
Now, SOMEONE<Benjamin> watches a TV weather report. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS762
01:48:25,00 --> 01:48:37,50
Now, a digital alarm clock on a nightstand reads 6:43 AM. In bed beside it, SOMEONE<Benjamin> wakes and slaps it. He frowns 	and pushes himself up a little. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS763
01:48:34,00 --> 01:48:41,50
The zoo owner rolls over and finds sunlight peeking in between his curtains. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS764
01:48:38,00 --> 01:48:44,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> climbs out of bed and draws the curtains apart. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS765
01:48:41,00 --> 01:48:49,50
Outside, the sun shines brightly through a row of tall leafy trees. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS766
01:48:47,00 --> 01:48:55,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> gives a satisfied smirk and dashes from the window. He hurries through the house. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS767
01:49:03,00 --> 01:49:12,50
The calendar's on SOMEONE's<Dylan's> door. Now, as SOMEONE<Benjamin> dons a zookeeper uniform, SOMEONE<Rosie> enters in one of her own. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS768
01:49:23,00 --> 01:49:27,50
Now, at the zoo entrance. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS769
01:49:45,00 --> 01:49:51,50
The uniformed staffers listen with fond respectful gazes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS770
01:49:53,00 --> 01:49:59,50
SOMEONE<MacCready> cuts a red ribbon stretching across the entryway. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS771
01:50:06,00 --> 01:50:13,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> checks his watch. SOMEONE<Rosie> peers down the dirt road, but finds no sign of visitors. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS772
01:50:25,00 --> 01:50:29,50
SOMEONE<Dylan> runs down the road. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS773
01:50:29,00 --> 01:50:33,50
The others follow him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS774
01:50:33,00 --> 01:50:39,50
He finds a massive tree blocking the road. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS775
01:50:41,00 --> 01:50:47,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> joins his son as he climbs onto the toppled tree. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS776
01:50:44,00 --> 01:50:49,50
SOMEONE<Kelly>, SOMEONE<MacCready>, and SOMEONE<Robin> follow suit. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS777
01:50:46,00 --> 01:50:53,50
On the other side, they find a crowd waiting by a line of cars. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS778
01:50:54,00 --> 01:51:04,50
As SOMEONE<Benjamin> stares with astonished eyes, the zoo's patrons give excited looks. He snaps out of his daze. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS779
01:51:04,00 --> 01:51:10,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> helps people climb over the tree. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS780
01:51:09,00 --> 01:51:14,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> takes a woman's hand as she climbs up. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS781
01:51:15,00 --> 01:51:21,50
SOMEONE<Lily> and SOMEONE<Rosie> help the guests as they climb down on the other side. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS782
01:51:21,00 --> 01:51:29,50
With Crystal perched on his shoulder, SOMEONE<Robin> lifts a boy off the tree and sets him on the ground. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS783
01:51:26,00 --> 01:51:32,50
Beaming, the zoo staffers assist their eager guests. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS784
01:51:29,00 --> 01:51:35,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> holds out her hand for a descending woman. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS785
01:51:32,00 --> 01:51:41,50
Gazing down the road, SOMEONE<Benjamin> sees long lines of people surging forward around the parked cars. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS786
01:51:44,00 --> 01:51:51,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> looks out at the crowd, then glances at SOMEONE<Benjamin>, and gives an overjoyed laugh. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS787
01:51:49,00 --> 01:52:03,50
Later in the bustling zoo, a staffer hands out brochures, an old woman gives away balloons, and SOMEONE<Lily> distributes 	packaged kites. In front of the tiger enclosure, SOMEONE<Kelly> gives a talk. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS788
01:52:10,00 --> 01:52:15,50
SOMEONE<Rosie> gives a talk to guests. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS789
01:52:16,00 --> 01:52:21,50
Mr. SOMEONE<Stephen> stands with two boys. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS790
01:52:24,00 --> 01:52:28,50
Crystal smacks SOMEONE's<Robin's> head. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS791
01:52:26,00 --> 01:52:31,50
A guest pats SOMEONE's<Benjamin's> arm. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS792
01:52:33,00 --> 01:52:41,50
As he smiles at passing patrons, his gaze finds the Home Depot cashier in the crowd. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS793
01:52:39,00 --> 01:52:44,50
She gives an impressed smile. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS794
01:52:42,00 --> 01:52:47,50
She pats his shoulder. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS795
01:52:44,00 --> 01:52:53,50
In a small office, SOMEONE<Kelly> checks inside an empty ticket box. SOMEONE<Benjamin> enters as she searches under a table. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS796
01:52:58,00 --> 01:53:04,50
Turning, he finds himself face to face with SOMEONE<Kelly>. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS797
01:53:06,00 --> 01:53:11,50
She closes her eyes and presses her lips to his. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS798
01:53:08,00 --> 01:53:15,50
As she draws back, her uncertain gaze flickers over his face. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS799
01:53:12,00 --> 01:53:17,50
She smiles nervously. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS800
01:53:19,00 --> 01:53:24,50
He kisses her and she closes her eyes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS801
01:53:23,00 --> 01:53:32,50
As he pulls away slightly, SOMEONE<Kelly> leans closer, her eyes still closed, and lets her lips graze his. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS802
01:53:30,00 --> 01:53:35,50
She twitches a smile and her eyelids flutter open. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS803
01:53:37,00 --> 01:53:41,50
She nods. He gazes at her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS804
01:53:41,00 --> 01:53:45,50
He gives a tender look. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS805
01:53:42,00 --> 01:53:47,50
Standing hastily, she leaves. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS806
01:53:44,00 --> 01:53:50,50
He glances after her, then shifts his thoughtful eyes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS807
01:53:47,00 --> 01:53:52,50
Later, SOMEONE<Rosie> aims a camera. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS808
01:53:51,00 --> 01:53:55,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> and SOMEONE<Dylan> pose. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS809
01:53:58,00 --> 01:54:03,50
SOMEONE<Lily> and SOMEONE<Kelly> watch from a bench. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS810
01:54:06,00 --> 01:54:14,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> pretends to toss SOMEONE<Rosie> into the tiger enclosure. SOMEONE<Lily> stares at them. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS811
01:54:16,00 --> 01:54:25,50
She turns to her older cousin. SOMEONE<Kelly> looks at SOMEONE<Benjamin> and SOMEONE<Dylan>, who pose with their arms draped over each other's 	shoulders. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS812
01:54:22,00 --> 01:54:26,50
She smiles. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS813
01:54:23,00 --> 01:54:28,50
SOMEONE<Lily> notes her cousin's expression. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS814
01:54:28,00 --> 01:54:32,50
She grins. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS815
01:54:31,00 --> 01:54:38,50
She watches as SOMEONE<Benjamin> and SOMEONE<Rosie> pretend to flex their biceps for a photo.

01:54:38,00 --> 01:54:53,50
Now, kites float high in the sky. A girl with glasses holds her spool above her head. And a boy winds the string of his. 	Another kid holds his red kite up as he runs. And a woman a launches her own identical one. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS817
01:54:50,00 --> 01:54:57,50
SOMEONE<Kelly> stands with SOMEONE<Rosie>, who glances up at her as she flies her red kite. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS818
01:54:54,00 --> 01:55:00,50
Smiling, the zookeeper crouches behind her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS819
01:54:57,00 --> 01:55:03,50
As SOMEONE<Benjamin> strolls through the crowd, he spots the kites. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS820
01:55:05,00 --> 01:55:14,50
Gazing up at the kite-filled sky, SOMEONE<Benjamin> smiles lovingly. With her eyes on him, SOMEONE<Kelly> straightens. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS821
01:55:15,00 --> 01:55:20,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> meets her gaze with a grateful look. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS822
01:55:18,00 --> 01:55:24,50
She beams. His eyes crinkle at the corners as he smiles at her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS823
01:55:22,00 --> 01:55:26,50
He shrugs a shoulder. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS824
01:55:29,00 --> 01:55:38,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> nods at SOMEONE<Kelly> and she glances at the crowd. She lifts her brow in an impressed look. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS825
01:55:35,00 --> 01:55:50,50
We see animals in their respective enclosures. A tiger strides across grass. A capuchin sticks out its tongue. Buster 	lifts his face to the sunlight. Flamingos drink from a pond. And SOMEONE<Solomon> opens his mouth. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS826
01:55:48,00 --> 01:55:54,50
Now, SOMEONE<Duncan> joins SOMEONE<Benjamin> in a lookout tower. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS827
01:55:55,00 --> 01:55:59,50
They gaze out at departing guest. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS828
01:56:07,00 --> 01:56:14,50
Now, the Mee family enters a restaurant. Its sign reads Little Dom's. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS829
01:56:37,00 --> 01:56:43,50
As they gaze at an empty table, SOMEONE<Rosie> smiles. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS830
01:56:43,00 --> 01:56:48,50
His kids watch as he hurries out the door. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS831
01:56:46,00 --> 01:56:51,50
He reappears at a window beside them. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS832
01:56:52,00 --> 01:56:57,50
Reenacting, he halts in his tracks. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS834
01:57:18,00 --> 01:57:21,50
He checks his watch. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS835
01:57:19,00 --> 01:57:26,50
He enters through a side door and stops a few feet from the table where SOMEONE<Katherine> had been. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS836
01:57:38,00 --> 01:57:42,50
He gives a nod. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS837
01:57:42,00 --> 01:57:53,50
He strides up to the table, faces a seat, then stares wistfully. SOMEONE<Rosie> lifts her brow in an expectant look and SOMEONE<Dylan> 	smiles. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS838
01:58:00,00 --> 01:58:04,50
He sees SOMEONE<Katherine> seating at the table. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS839
01:58:02,00 --> 01:58:09,50
As the pretty brunette lifts her gaze to his, he watches with longing eyes. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS840
01:58:07,00 --> 01:58:11,50
She grins at him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS841
01:58:10,00 --> 01:58:17,50
With a smile, he turns to his kids. SOMEONE<Rosie> looks up at SOMEONE<Dylan>, who smiles. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS842
01:58:16,00 --> 01:58:24,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> gestures at SOMEONE<Katherine>, and SOMEONE's<Dylan's> eyes fill with tears as he sees her sitting there. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS843
01:58:24,00 --> 01:58:29,50
Shifting his gaze from his kids, 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS844
01:58:26,00 --> 01:58:31,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> turns to the pretty brunette. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS845
01:58:29,00 --> 01:58:33,50
She smiles tenderly at him. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS846
01:58:30,00 --> 01:58:35,50
He stares down at her. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS847
01:58:39,00 --> 01:58:46,50
As she gazes up at him, her lips spread into a faint smile. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS848
01:58:43,00 --> 01:58:49,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> sucks in a breath and she grins. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS851
01:58:56,00 --> 01:59:09,50
Now, words appear. The Dartmoor Animal Park on which this story is based is an acclaimed zoo whose methods are studied worldwide. 	The park is open to faithful followers year-round. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS852
01:59:07,00 --> 01:59:13,50
SOMEONE<Benjamin> Mee and his two kids still live on the grounds. 

WE_BOUGHT_A_ZOO_DVS853
01:59:10,00 --> 01:59:15,50
Next year, they plan to add giraffes.
