WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS44
00:02:41,00 --> 00:02:46,50
The man breezes through donning a bicycle helmet. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS45
00:02:47,00 --> 00:02:54,50
He faces her with an eager smile, then dumps his stuff as she serves up his breakfast. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS46
00:02:51,00 --> 00:02:57,50
The man flops down at the table, his T-shirt reading, "Save The Fucking Earth. " 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS48
00:03:04,00 --> 00:03:09,50
The woman sits facing him. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS49
00:03:25,00 --> 00:03:30,50
Later, a door labeled "6C" opens. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS50
00:03:28,00 --> 00:03:36,50
The bicyclist steps out, carrying a wok and a toothbrush, then turns back to face the blonde. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS51
00:03:43,00 --> 00:03:46,50
He heads off. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS52
00:03:48,00 --> 00:03:58,50
Across the way, the door to 6A opens. A strikingly handsome man steps out naked, covering his genitals with a dishrag. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS53
00:03:57,00 --> 00:04:07,50
Getting a newspaper, he notices the blonde and smiles. She stares, then shuts her door. Now outside, she uses her cell. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS54
00:04:29,00 --> 00:04:33,50
She greets a delivery man. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS55
00:04:32,00 --> 00:04:39,50
Now, SOMEONE<Ally> emerges from Boston State Street T Station onto a busy sidewalk. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS56
00:04:38,00 --> 00:04:46,50
She pauses to get her bearings, then hustles across the street, chomping down a hot dog as she goes. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS57
00:04:44,00 --> 00:04:52,50
As she reaches the other side, our view lifts to the densely packed skyscrapers lining the street. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS58
00:04:51,00 --> 00:04:57,50
Now an elevator opens and SOMEONE<Ally> hurries out. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS59
00:04:54,00 --> 00:05:02,50
Entering a workspace, she passes lettering on a window that reads, "Linsky Solutions. " 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS60
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:04,50
She hurries to her desk. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS61
00:05:03,00 --> 00:05:08,50
A coworker faces a windowed office. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS62
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:15,50
A boss taps his fingers under his nose. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS63
00:05:19,00 --> 00:05:24,50
The boss faces them through his office window and stands. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS64
00:05:23,00 --> 00:05:27,50
They quickly go back to work. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS65
00:05:28,00 --> 00:05:33,50
He beckons her into his office, then talks on a phone. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS66
00:05:39,00 --> 00:05:43,50
SOMEONE<Ally> starts to remove her coat. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS67
00:05:44,00 --> 00:05:51,50
Now, SOMEONE<Ally> stands alone at a train platform, holding a box of personal items. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS68
00:05:52,00 --> 00:05:56,50
They flashback to the office. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS69
00:05:56,00 --> 00:06:01,50
He brings his fingers up to his nose and inhales. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS70
00:05:58,00 --> 00:06:03,50
On the T, SOMEONE<Ally> slumps. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS71
00:06:07,00 --> 00:06:14,50
SOMEONE<Ally> purses her lips receptively, then sweeps her long bangs out of her face. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS73
00:06:13,00 --> 00:06:19,50
With a sheepish gaze her boss slowly swivels his chair around, putting his back to her. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS75
00:06:17,00 --> 00:06:24,50
On the train, SOMEONE<Ally> sets her box aside, then takes out a magazine and flips through it. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS76
00:06:27,00 --> 00:06:34,50
SOMEONE<Ally> pouts, then slaps the magazine shut and answers her cell with a forced smile. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS77
00:06:35,00 --> 00:06:41,50
She ends the call, glancing at an older woman beside her. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS78
00:06:40,00 --> 00:06:48,50
She opens her magazine to a feature titled "Ten Glam Looks For Office To Evening. " 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS79
00:06:48,00 --> 00:06:53,50
Another, "Is This Food Scale Your New Best Friend?" 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS80
00:06:51,00 --> 00:06:57,50
She comes across an article titled "What's Your Number?" 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS81
00:06:55,00 --> 00:07:03,50
A tagline reads "The average number of lovers women have in their lifetime is 10. 5. " 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS82
00:07:04,00 --> 00:07:08,50
The older woman beside her stares. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS83
00:07:22,00 --> 00:07:28,50
Turning away, SOMEONE<Ally> defensively screws her mouth to one side. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS84
00:07:26,00 --> 00:07:33,50
She sets the magazine aside, then bites her lip and shifts her calculating gaze. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS85
00:07:33,00 --> 00:07:38,50
She reaches into the box and pulls out a small notebook and pen. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS86
00:07:38,00 --> 00:07:46,50
Glancing around, she opens it and heads a blank page with the words "People I've Slept With. " 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS87
00:07:46,00 --> 00:07:53,50
Now as she enters her apartment building's lobby, her list fades into view. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS89
00:07:54,00 --> 00:08:02,50
Finding the elevator out of service, she heads up the winding rectangular staircase. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS91
00:08:02,00 --> 00:08:08,50
Now a wall in her apartment shows her shadow as she undresses. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS92
00:08:06,00 --> 00:08:11,50
Wearing only panties, she scampers across our view. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS93
00:08:10,00 --> 00:08:15,50
Now she showers with the bathroom door open. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS94
00:08:14,00 --> 00:08:22,50
She steps out of the shower, obscured by steam, bends over her open notebook, and adds the name to the list. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS95
00:08:20,00 --> 00:08:26,50
Now a taxi pulls away revealing SOMEONE<Ally> in a Navy Blue sheath dress. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS96
00:08:24,00 --> 00:08:31,50
She fidgets self-consciously, then takes a breath and trots across a driveway. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS97
00:08:28,00 --> 00:08:34,50
Now a door opens and SOMEONE<Ally> steps inside a foyer. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS98
00:08:31,00 --> 00:08:39,50
She climbs a flight of stairs up to a tasteful party where an elegant blonde spots her. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS99
00:08:40,00 --> 00:08:43,50
They hug. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS100
00:08:45,00 --> 00:08:50,50
Her mother disapprovingly adjusts her bangs. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS101
00:09:22,00 --> 00:09:28,50
Halfway upstairs, SOMEONE<Ally> writes in her notebook. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS102
00:09:27,00 --> 00:09:31,50
At a mirror, SOMEONE<Daisy> curls her lashes. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS103
00:09:49,00 --> 00:09:56,50
Perching in an armchair, SOMEONE<Ally> leans back and peers out a window. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS104
00:10:01,00 --> 00:10:07,50
SOMEONE<Ally> takes her notebook from her purse and writes. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS105
00:10:21,00 --> 00:10:26,50
As SOMEONE<Daisy> leaves, SOMEONE<Ally> counts the entries on her list. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS106
00:10:36,00 --> 00:10:42,50
SOMEONE grabs a glass of champagne and gulps down half its content 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS107
00:10:40,00 --> 00:10:46,50
Now at the party downstairs, her mother taps the side of her wine 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS108
00:10:49,00 --> 00:10:55,50
SOMEONE<Ally> comes down barefooted, swigging champagne from the bottle. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS109
00:10:52,00 --> 00:10:57,50
She notices a short man chatting up a model type. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS110
00:10:56,00 --> 00:11:00,50
She pats his head. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS111
00:10:58,00 --> 00:11:05,50
She pads down the hall and wedges between an attractive young man and woman. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS112
00:11:04,00 --> 00:11:10,50
She rounds a corner, then peeks back at the woman with Beau. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS113
00:11:15,00 --> 00:11:19,50
SOMEONE<Ally> hungrily eyes hors d'oeuvres. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS114
00:11:26,00 --> 00:11:32,50
The drunk young woman reluctantly makes her way to the center of the party. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS115
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:35,50
Amid a huddle of giggling women, one aims her videophone. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS116
00:11:34,00 --> 00:11:40,50
SOMEONE<Ally> spins to face the engaged couple and flourishes her free hand. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS117
00:12:04,00 --> 00:12:08,50
The woman filming her grins and nods. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS118
00:12:15,00 --> 00:12:20,50
A woman with long bangs stands sheepishly. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS119
00:12:18,00 --> 00:12:23,50
Facing the video camera, she gives a chuckle. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS120
00:12:54,00 --> 00:12:59,50
SOMEONE's<Ally's> mother gives an embarrassed smirk and shrug of the head. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS121
00:13:00,00 --> 00:13:06,50
SOMEONE<Ally> shatters a man's glass with her bottle. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS122
00:13:05,00 --> 00:13:10,50
SOMEONE<Eddie> smiles comfortingly at his fiancÃ©e. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS123
00:13:07,00 --> 00:13:14,50
Now at a bar, SOMEONE<Daisy>, SOMEONE<Ally>, and the women from the huddle drink together. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS124
00:13:19,00 --> 00:13:23,50
The women drink shots. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS125
00:13:38,00 --> 00:13:46,50
Now as a bartender pours a line of shots, SOMEONE's<Ally's> former boss leans into view beside her. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS126
00:13:49,00 --> 00:13:53,50
He looks at the shots. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS127
00:14:24,00 --> 00:14:29,50
Grinning, SOMEONE<Ally> leaves with the drinks. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS128
00:14:29,00 --> 00:14:33,50
Back with the group of women. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS129
00:14:39,00 --> 00:14:44,50
SOMEONE<Daisy> draws a slip of paper and reads. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS130
00:14:55,00 --> 00:14:59,50
She draws a slip two inches. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS132
00:15:33,00 --> 00:15:38,50
SOMEONE<Jamie> unfolds a slip of paper. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS133
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:48,50
SOMEONE's<Ally's> grin fades. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS134
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:06,50
With a forced smile, she reaches into the bowl and picks her own number. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS135
00:16:04,00 --> 00:16:08,50
She tears it in half. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS136
00:18:04,00 --> 00:18:10,50
SOMEONE<Ally> downs the shot. Later, she tipsily stands with another. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS137
00:18:11,00 --> 00:18:16,50
Now she stands on the bar, the crowd at her feet. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS138
00:18:19,00 --> 00:18:26,50
Barefoot on the bar top, SOMEONE<Ally> downs another drink and bobs her head awkwardly. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS139
00:18:23,00 --> 00:18:30,50
Light flashes brightly as in fast motion. She marches up and down the bar. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS140
00:18:27,00 --> 00:18:35,50
Amidst the crowd, SOMEONE's<Ally's> former boss bobs his head, watching her with a smile as she dances wildly. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS144
00:18:39,00 --> 00:18:45,50
In the morning, SOMEONE<Ally> sleeps curled up in bed, facing her nightstand. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS145
00:18:42,00 --> 00:18:50,50
From behind her, an arm in a blazer flaps into view, its hand latching onto her breast. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS146
00:18:47,00 --> 00:18:53,50
SOMEONE<Ally> wakes, then slowly looks over her shoulder. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS147
00:18:51,00 --> 00:18:57,50
Her former boss slumbers on his stomach at her side. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS148
00:18:54,00 --> 00:19:01,50
SOMEONE's<Ally's> gaze sweeps down his body and finds him naked from the waist down. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS149
00:19:01,00 --> 00:19:07,50
Her jaw drops open and she moves his arm off of her. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS150
00:19:04,00 --> 00:19:10,50
SOMEONE<Ally> grabs a T-shirt off the floor and pulls it on. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS151
00:19:07,00 --> 00:19:14,50
Creeping past the foot of the bed, she frantically dials a call. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS152
00:19:11,00 --> 00:19:15,50
Reaching the bathroom, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS153
00:19:12,00 --> 00:19:17,50
she drops down on her knees. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS154
00:19:14,00 --> 00:19:18,50
On a beach. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS155
00:19:15,00 --> 00:19:20,50
a crisply dressed SOMEONE<Daisy> walks with SOMEONE<Eddie>. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS173
00:19:50,00 --> 00:19:55,50
As he gets up, she turns and watches him dress. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS175
00:19:57,00 --> 00:20:01,50
He reaches down the front of his pants, then brings his fingers up to his nose. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS177
00:20:04,00 --> 00:20:10,50
Later, SOMEONE<Ally> paces anxiously in her living room. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS178
00:20:07,00 --> 00:20:12,50
Her former boss strides in from the bathroom. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS179
00:20:22,00 --> 00:20:27,50
SOMEONE<Ally> opens the door to her neighbor. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS180
00:20:26,00 --> 00:20:31,50
She throws a newspaper. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS181
00:20:43,00 --> 00:20:49,50
As Roger shakes SOMEONE's<Colin's> hand, SOMEONE<Ally> cringes. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS182
00:21:00,00 --> 00:21:05,50
Holding her hands, Roger sniffs his finger. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS183
00:21:17,00 --> 00:21:25,50
On his way out, Roger lifts her up and pins her against the wall in an impassioned kiss. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS184
00:21:22,00 --> 00:21:26,50
He sets her down and goes. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS185
00:21:24,00 --> 00:21:29,50
SOMEONE<Colin> eyes a display of little sculptures. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS186
00:21:28,00 --> 00:21:35,50
As Roger saunters to the stairs, a tall glamorous woman comes out of SOMEONE's<Colin's> apartment. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS187
00:21:33,00 --> 00:21:36,50
He darts out of view. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS188
00:21:55,00 --> 00:22:00,50
SOMEONE<Colin> eyes the sculptures again. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS189
00:22:32,00 --> 00:22:36,50
SOMEONE<Colin> uses the peephole. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS190
00:22:40,00 --> 00:22:46,50
Now at a bakery, SOMEONE<Daisy> makes notes at a table. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS191
00:22:43,00 --> 00:22:48,50
Beside her, SOMEONE<Ally> wolfs down a sample of cake. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS192
00:23:17,00 --> 00:23:22,50
SOMEONE<Ally> faces the entrance and frowns. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS193
00:23:24,00 --> 00:23:29,50
An athletic, stylishly unshaven man. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS194
00:23:41,00 --> 00:23:45,50
She remembers him as obese. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS195
00:23:46,00 --> 00:23:50,50
SOMEONE's<Ally's> fat too. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS196
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:04,50
In the present. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS197
00:24:09,00 --> 00:24:14,50
Lingering near the entrance, he flips through a catalog. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS198
00:24:12,00 --> 00:24:17,50
SOMEONE<Ally> wanders over, pretending to browse. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS199
00:24:15,00 --> 00:24:19,50
Pausing by a cake, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS200
00:24:17,00 --> 00:24:21,50
she looks back at her sister and nods. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS201
00:24:19,00 --> 00:24:23,50
Glancing up from the catalog, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS202
00:24:20,00 --> 00:24:24,50
SOMEONE<Donald> notices her. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS203
00:24:33,00 --> 00:24:39,50
A stunning brunette joins SOMEONE<Donald> at his side. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS204
00:24:50,00 --> 00:24:54,50
They smooch. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS205
00:25:31,00 --> 00:25:35,50
Now she leaves with SOMEONE<Daisy>. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS206
00:25:47,00 --> 00:25:52,50
SOMEONE<Ally> halts and her sister faces her. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS207
00:26:01,00 --> 00:26:08,50
Now at home, she carries a bottle of wine and a stack of keepsake books. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS208
00:26:06,00 --> 00:26:14,50
She sets the bottle down with a glass already poured, puts down the books, and sits facing a computer. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS209
00:26:25,00 --> 00:26:30,50
She sips wine as she searches. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS210
00:26:36,00 --> 00:26:41,50
She unfolds a sheet of paper. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS211
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:51,50
She modifies her search. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS212
00:27:02,00 --> 00:27:06,50
A porn site pops up. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS213
00:27:09,00 --> 00:27:17,50
In fast motion, she drinks more wine. Later, she passes out with her head on the keyboard. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS214
00:27:17,00 --> 00:27:26,50
Now, SOMEONE's<Ally's> computer shows a cartoon of a tiny mushroom-shaped penis situated on an oversized pair of balls. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS215
00:27:23,00 --> 00:27:29,50
A friendly little face stares out from its head. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS216
00:27:26,00 --> 00:27:33,50
The cartoon taps one testicle and bobs its head in a chipper little dance. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS217
00:27:30,00 --> 00:27:35,50
Waking, SOMEONE<Ally> stares at the cartoon. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS218
00:27:37,00 --> 00:27:41,50
It sings. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS219
00:27:42,00 --> 00:27:48,50
SOMEONE<Ally> grabs a sheet of paper and spies SOMEONE<Colin> opening his door. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS220
00:27:48,00 --> 00:27:54,50
She goes out as SOMEONE<Colin> retrieves his paper in the nude. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS221
00:28:21,00 --> 00:28:26,50
She steps closer, averting her gaze. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS222
00:28:23,00 --> 00:28:29,50
SOMEONE<Colin> bites into an apple as he looks over her list. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS223
00:28:26,00 --> 00:28:32,50
He lifts the dishrag covering his genitals and dabs at his mouth. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS224
00:28:54,00 --> 00:28:59,50
SOMEONE storms back to her apartment 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS225
00:28:56,00 --> 00:29:00,50
slams the door. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS226
00:28:57,00 --> 00:29:03,50
She slaps the list down by her computer and folds her arms in a pout. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS227
00:29:02,00 --> 00:29:06,50
Her eyes widen. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS228
00:29:03,00 --> 00:29:10,50
She grabs her jacket and wrenches it on as she races back to SOMEONE's<Colin's> door. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS229
00:29:12,00 --> 00:29:16,50
He opens the door. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS230
00:29:17,00 --> 00:29:22,50
She encounters SOMEONE's<Colin's> date. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS231
00:29:37,00 --> 00:29:43,50
SOMEONE<Ally> drags SOMEONE<Colin> out of his apartment and hustles him into her own. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS232
00:29:58,00 --> 00:30:03,50
SOMEONE<Ally> gives SOMEONE<Colin> a sidelong look. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS233
00:30:03,00 --> 00:30:07,50
Now, they get sandwiches to go. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS234
00:30:11,00 --> 00:30:15,50
SOMEONE<Colin> checks out a brunette. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS235
00:31:17,00 --> 00:31:26,50
Wearing a T-shirt that reads "Free Licks," SOMEONE<Colin> looks down at the sandwich, then takes an enormous bite. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS236
00:31:23,00 --> 00:31:29,50
SOMEONE<Ally> rolls her eyes in a good-humored sneer, then steps away. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS237
00:31:27,00 --> 00:31:32,50
Now a selection of wedding dresses hangs on a rack. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS238
00:31:29,00 --> 00:31:35,50
As SOMEONE<Daisy> looks through them, SOMEONE<Ally> holds up another. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS239
00:31:43,00 --> 00:31:48,50
She points to a sickly green gown. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS240
00:31:53,00 --> 00:31:57,50
SOMEONE<Daisy> emerges from a fitting room. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS241
00:32:58,00 --> 00:33:02,50
A flashback. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS242
00:32:59,00 --> 00:33:06,50
A black-haired bartender wearing eyeliner pulls a quarter out from behind SOMEONE's<Ally's> ear. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS243
00:33:05,00 --> 00:33:11,50
With her hair dyed black, she lies beneath him in bed. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS244
00:33:08,00 --> 00:33:15,50
He reaches down between her legs and pulls up a handful of quarters. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS245
00:33:15,00 --> 00:33:20,50
SOMEONE<Ally> gives a delighted grin. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS246
00:33:17,00 --> 00:33:22,50
In the present, she joins SOMEONE<Colin> in a booth at a bar. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS247
00:33:27,00 --> 00:33:32,50
SOMEONE<Ally> looks around eagerly. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS248
00:33:36,00 --> 00:33:39,50
SOMEONE<Colin> points. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS249
00:33:37,00 --> 00:33:45,50
Turning, SOMEONE<Ally> finds her now spiky-haired ex behind the bar flourishing his hands at a brunette beauty. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS250
00:33:42,00 --> 00:33:47,50
He pulls a coin out from behind her ear. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS251
00:33:51,00 --> 00:33:56,50
She leaves and SOMEONE<Colin> follows her out. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS252
00:35:03,00 --> 00:35:08,50
Now, people buy produce at a bustling farmers' market. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS253
00:35:06,00 --> 00:35:14,50
In an alley, several kids play with a ball as white clothes hang on a sun-drenched clothesline nearby. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS254
00:35:11,00 --> 00:35:16,50
In bed, SOMEONE<Ally> stirs sleepily. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS255
00:35:13,00 --> 00:35:18,50
Waking, she rubs her eye 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS256
00:35:15,00 --> 00:35:21,50
She gets up, revealing a tiny T-shirt and boy-cut panties. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS257
00:35:19,00 --> 00:35:23,50
Tousling her hair, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS258
00:35:20,00 --> 00:35:26,50
she glances through her doorway as she pads down toward the bathroom. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS259
00:35:30,00 --> 00:35:34,50
SOMEONE<Colin> lies on her couch. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS260
00:36:19,00 --> 00:36:24,50
She faces SOMEONE's<Colin's> laptop. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS261
00:36:41,00 --> 00:36:48,50
Later, she comes up the building's stairs, a new coffee pot tucked under her arm. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS262
00:36:54,00 --> 00:36:58,50
SOMEONE<Colin> holds one up. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS263
00:36:57,00 --> 00:37:01,50
Later at SOMEONE's<Colin's>. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS264
00:37:00,00 --> 00:37:08,50
As he brings beer to a table set for two, SOMEONE<Ally> notices a large chart featuring her exes. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS265
00:37:16,00 --> 00:37:21,50
Later, they eat as they go through his findings. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS266
00:38:08,00 --> 00:38:12,50
Now on a cobblestone street. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS267
00:38:40,00 --> 00:38:44,50
They enter a house through its open door. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS268
00:38:46,00 --> 00:38:51,50
He puts a sandwich down. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS269
00:38:48,00 --> 00:38:55,50
As he trots upstairs, SOMEONE<Donald> comes in with a bag of groceries. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS270
00:38:52,00 --> 00:38:57,50
SOMEONE<Ally> spots a photo of him and SOMEONE<Cara>. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS271
00:39:26,00 --> 00:39:31,50
She pauses on her way out, still holding it. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS272
00:39:31,00 --> 00:39:36,50
She sets it down with her sandwich and goes. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS273
00:39:33,00 --> 00:39:39,50
SOMEONE<Donald> carries his groceries further inside. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS274
00:39:38,00 --> 00:39:44,50
SOMEONE<Colin> dashes downstairs and out the door. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS275
00:39:41,00 --> 00:39:47,50
SOMEONE<Donald> scrambles back into view, looking around wildly. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS278
00:39:50,00 --> 00:39:59,50
As SOMEONE<Ally> looks away, she notices a man in a stylish cardigan sweater leaving his house. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS281
00:40:01,00 --> 00:40:11,50
In a flashback, SOMEONE<Ally> works as a waitress, wearing a short black dress with a white apron and frilly white hat. She smiles at the dashing Simon. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS286
00:40:21,00 --> 00:40:27,50
He raises his eyebrows. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS287
00:40:25,00 --> 00:40:31,50
With a wide grin, SOMEONE<Ally> opens her mouth to speak. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS288
00:40:29,00 --> 00:40:33,50
In the present, she shoves SOMEONE<Colin>. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS292
00:40:35,00 --> 00:40:43,50
As they tussle in the middle of the street, Simon notices. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS293
00:40:41,00 --> 00:40:47,50
She takes a deep breath and scrunches up her face. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS296
00:40:49,00 --> 00:40:54,50
She shoots a look at SOMEONE<Colin>, who cracks up. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS300
00:41:14,00 --> 00:41:18,50
She faces SOMEONE<Colin>. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS301
00:41:30,00 --> 00:41:35,50
Later on the apartment stairs. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS302
00:41:41,00 --> 00:41:46,50
In the pub, a dart bounces off the board. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS303
00:41:45,00 --> 00:41:50,50
SOMEONE<Ally> throws another into a shelf of glasses. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS304
00:41:51,00 --> 00:41:56,50
Another of her throws bounces off the ceiling. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS305
00:41:57,00 --> 00:42:03,50
Simon gives an awkward nod and SOMEONE<Ally> crosses to her drink at the bar. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS306
00:42:19,00 --> 00:42:23,50
Simon eyes her quizzically. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS307
00:42:31,00 --> 00:42:35,50
SOMEONE<Ally> cringes. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS308
00:42:49,00 --> 00:42:55,50
Simon furrows his brow at her and she gives a little shrug. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS309
00:42:52,00 --> 00:42:56,50
In the stairwell. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS310
00:43:02,00 --> 00:43:09,50
Nighttime. On the roof, they sit on a couch eating pizza and beer. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS311
00:44:11,00 --> 00:44:17,50
SOMEONE<Ally> pouts and lowers her gaze to her slice of pizza. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS312
00:44:14,00 --> 00:44:22,50
In a flashback, a teenaged SOMEONE<Ally> with chin-length hair and bangs opens her front door. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS313
00:44:19,00 --> 00:44:26,50
A dorky guy with large glasses and mismatched clothes stands on the stoop. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS314
00:44:30,00 --> 00:44:37,50
SOMEONE<Ally> slouches against the door, looks down, then gives Gerry a little smile. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS315
00:44:34,00 --> 00:44:41,50
Now in bed, Gerry rocks slightly on top of SOMEONE<Ally>, grimacing with his eyes closed. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS316
00:44:39,00 --> 00:44:43,50
A puppet moves in beside them. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS317
00:44:40,00 --> 00:44:48,50
Having the same characteristics as Gerry, the puppet looks from SOMEONE<Ally> to Gerry and back again. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS318
00:44:45,00 --> 00:44:51,50
On the roof, SOMEONE<Ally> bites into her pizza. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS319
00:45:03,00 --> 00:45:08,50
SOMEONE<Ally> leans in to look at a file in SOMEONE's<Colin's> hands. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS320
00:45:06,00 --> 00:45:10,50
Daytime. They walk along the harbor. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS321
00:45:43,00 --> 00:45:48,50
Later, SOMEONE<Ally> arrives at a restaurant. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS322
00:45:47,00 --> 00:45:51,50
She joins SOMEONE<Daisy> at a table for three. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS323
00:45:53,00 --> 00:45:58,50
SOMEONE<Ally> stands, then slumps back down. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS324
00:46:14,00 --> 00:46:19,50
Their mother arrives and kisses SOMEONE's<Daisy's> cheek. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS325
00:46:18,00 --> 00:46:22,50
She kisses SOMEONE<Ally> and strokes her hair. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS326
00:46:37,00 --> 00:46:41,50
Their mother glares at SOMEONE<Daisy>. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS328
00:47:49,00 --> 00:47:59,50
Now a plane touches down on a tarmac. In a doctor's office, SOMEONE<Ally> slips off her panties from under a hospital gown and shoves them in her bag. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS329
00:47:56,00 --> 00:48:04,50
She takes out a SOMEONE<lacy> purple thong and matching bra, and gently lays them on a chair with her clothes. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS330
00:48:01,00 --> 00:48:07,50
A clean-cut doctor walks in with his eyes on a file. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS331
00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:13,50
She stares, slack-jawed. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS333
00:48:32,00 --> 00:48:36,50
SOMEONE<Barrett> cocks his head. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS334
00:48:44,00 --> 00:48:49,50
He helps her put a foot in the stirrups. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS335
00:48:46,00 --> 00:48:53,50
As he readies a bright light at the end of the exam table, SOMEONE<Ally> solemnly lies back. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS336
00:48:51,00 --> 00:48:56,50
SOMEONE<Barrett> leans down and takes a look between her legs. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS337
00:49:00,00 --> 00:49:04,50
In the apartment stairwell. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS338
00:49:47,00 --> 00:49:52,50
Now outside, SOMEONE<Ally> answers her cell. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS339
00:49:53,00 --> 00:49:58,50
Later, SOMEONE<Ally> enters her apartment. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS340
00:49:58,00 --> 00:50:04,50
SOMEONE<Daisy> sits uncomfortably next to SOMEONE<Colin>, who holds a guitar on his bare lap. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS341
00:50:05,00 --> 00:50:09,50
He lifts the guitar. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS342
00:50:19,00 --> 00:50:23,50
She pulls out a pantsuit. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS343
00:51:08,00 --> 00:51:13,50
He leans forward to watch her go. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS344
00:51:11,00 --> 00:51:14,50
In Washington. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS345
00:51:20,00 --> 00:51:25,50
SOMEONE<Ally> limps on a crowded walkway. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS346
00:51:26,00 --> 00:51:31,50
In a bubble bath, SOMEONE<Colin> listens and giggles. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS347
00:51:29,00 --> 00:51:33,50
A passing woman stares at SOMEONE<Ally>. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS348
00:51:34,00 --> 00:51:39,50
SOMEONE<Colin> listens to an iPod in one ear. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS349
00:51:45,00 --> 00:51:49,50
She ends the call. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS350
00:51:46,00 --> 00:51:54,50
SOMEONE<Colin> takes a picture of himself in the bath, holding up the iPod, with a goofy grin, and sends it to SOMEONE<Ally>. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS351
00:51:53,00 --> 00:51:58,50
She grins at the picture on her phone. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS352
00:51:55,00 --> 00:52:02,50
Now, men and women in conservative attire work in a stately two-story library. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS353
00:52:00,00 --> 00:52:06,50
SOMEONE<Ally> enters in her slim gray pantsuit, her hair pulled back into a bun. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS354
00:52:04,00 --> 00:52:10,50
She gives a man standing guard a little nod, then heads further in. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS355
00:52:07,00 --> 00:52:15,50
Nearing a giant statue in the center of the room, she spots a handsome African-American man reading. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS356
00:52:13,00 --> 00:52:18,50
SOMEONE<Ally> ducks into an alcove, then peers back out at him. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS357
00:52:16,00 --> 00:52:22,50
In a flashback, she and SOMEONE<Tom> hold out clipboards to passersby. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS358
00:52:32,00 --> 00:52:38,50
Pressing her lips together, SOMEONE<Ally> ducks back into the alcove. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS359
00:52:35,00 --> 00:52:41,50
Moments later, she casually steps out, pretending to read a book. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS360
00:52:39,00 --> 00:52:44,50
As she races for a seat with a good vantage of SOMEONE 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS361
00:52:41,00 --> 00:52:46,50
an older gentleman takes it. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS362
00:52:43,00 --> 00:52:50,50
SOMEONE<Ally> gazes across the room at her ex, who sits engrossed in his work. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS363
00:52:47,00 --> 00:52:52,50
As a woman leaves a seat across from the first, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS364
00:52:49,00 --> 00:52:54,50
SOMEONE<Ally> and a man both go for it. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS365
00:52:55,00 --> 00:52:59,50
SOMEONE<Ally> sets down her book and sits. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS366
00:52:57,00 --> 00:53:02,50
Trying for a better look at SOMEONE, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS367
00:52:59,00 --> 00:53:04,50
she leans back to peer around the statue. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS368
00:53:01,00 --> 00:53:07,50
She grimaces, then faces the others at the large table. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS369
00:53:16,00 --> 00:53:23,50
Later, they all hold the table under the lip and scoot it across the floor. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS370
00:53:25,00 --> 00:53:31,50
SOMEONE<Ally> looks past the statue at SOMEONE<Tom>. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS371
00:53:32,00 --> 00:53:37,50
As they set it down, a lamp falls off the edge. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS373
00:53:36,00 --> 00:53:42,50
SOMEONE's<Ally's> jaw goes slack and she looks over at SOMEONE<Tom> who grins at her. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS374
00:53:44,00 --> 00:53:50,50
Now in a hotel suite, SOMEONE<Ally> wears a robe and gets candy from the minibar. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS375
00:54:12,00 --> 00:54:16,50
She goes to the door. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS376
00:54:21,00 --> 00:54:26,50
Her eyes widen at the sight of a man holding a gift box. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS377
00:54:42,00 --> 00:54:46,50
SOMEONE<Colin> hangs up. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS378
00:54:45,00 --> 00:54:50,50
In a lobby, SOMEONE<Tom> sips a drink. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS379
00:54:47,00 --> 00:54:53,50
SOMEONE<Ally> arrives in the gifted dress, clutching a purse to her chest. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS380
00:54:55,00 --> 00:55:01,50
She shuffles forward in the skintight garment and lowers the purse. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS381
00:55:00,00 --> 00:55:05,50
Her cleavage overflows. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS382
00:55:12,00 --> 00:55:17,50
She links her arm in his. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS383
00:55:17,00 --> 00:55:22,50
She fishes out her phone and turns it off. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS384
00:55:23,00 --> 00:55:27,50
In Boston on the apartment roof, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS385
00:55:25,00 --> 00:55:30,50
SOMEONE<Colin> lowers his cell phone from his ear. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS386
00:55:27,00 --> 00:55:33,50
He looks at it, then thoughtfully rubs it against his chin. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS387
00:55:30,00 --> 00:55:36,50
Leaning his elbows on a railing, he looks out the city lights. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS389
00:55:35,00 --> 00:55:40,50
At the Washington party, SOMEONE<Tom> and SOMEONE<Ally> step out into a hallway. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS390
00:56:02,00 --> 00:56:07,50
He takes her hand and pulls her aside. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS391
00:56:47,00 --> 00:56:52,50
He mimes penises in his mouth and ears. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS392
00:57:08,00 --> 00:57:13,50
She forces a tight-lipped smile. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS393
00:57:10,00 --> 00:57:17,50
Now, lit windows in the Boston skyline twinkle in the night sky. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS394
00:57:14,00 --> 00:57:21,50
SOMEONE<Ally> climbs the stairs to her apartment, still in her heels and tight dress. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS395
00:57:18,00 --> 00:57:24,50
She gazes up at the landing and finds it empty. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS396
00:57:21,00 --> 00:57:27,50
Behind her, a neighbor steps out of an apartment with his dog. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS398
00:57:33,00 --> 00:57:38,50
She enters her dark apartment. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS400
00:57:36,00 --> 00:57:41,50
She turns on the light at the foyer. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS403
00:57:46,00 --> 00:57:53,50
SOMEONE<Colin> turns on a spotlight, which shines over a group of SOMEONE<Ally> sculptures. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS404
00:57:50,00 --> 00:57:55,50
He lights up another across the room. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS406
00:57:54,00 --> 00:57:59,50
Studying the highlighted urban scene, SOMEONE brighten 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS407
00:57:56,00 --> 00:58:03,50
She looks over the first group of sculptures, which depicts a wedding party. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS409
00:58:07,00 --> 00:58:13,50
He watches her cross the living room and approach the urban scene. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS415
00:58:19,00 --> 00:58:24,50
The sculpture depicts a shabby old man. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS417
00:58:31,00 --> 00:58:34,50
He heads off. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS418
00:58:34,00 --> 00:58:39,50
Later, they eat pizza and drink beer. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS419
00:58:41,00 --> 00:58:45,50
SOMEONE<Ally> throws a crust at him. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS420
00:59:00,00 --> 00:59:06,50
He hurries over to a keyboard and grabs an electric guitar. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS421
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:21,50
Still in her tight cocktail dress, SOMEONE<Ally> dances around the couch and faces SOMEONE<Colin>, wildly waving her arms overhead and kicking her feet. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS422
00:59:37,00 --> 00:59:41,50
She plops on the couch. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS423
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:19,50
She grabs his hands and he helps her up. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS424
01:00:16,00 --> 01:00:21,50
Now the near-full moon looms bright over a few 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS426
01:00:20,00 --> 01:00:25,50
SOMEONE<Colin> and SOMEONE<Ally> walk down a dark corridor. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS427
01:00:28,00 --> 01:00:35,50
He flips a switch, turning on a light and SOMEONE's<Ally's> jaw drops. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS428
01:00:32,00 --> 01:00:36,50
They continue walking. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS429
01:00:57,00 --> 01:01:01,50
She shoots a basket. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS430
01:01:04,00 --> 01:01:08,50
He moves to her spot on the court. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS431
01:01:07,00 --> 01:01:11,50
He takes a shot. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS432
01:01:13,00 --> 01:01:18,50
He unties his shoe. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS433
01:01:28,00 --> 01:01:34,50
She bounces the ball off the floor to the backboard and into the hoop. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS434
01:01:35,00 --> 01:01:39,50
SOMEONE<Colin> gives it a try, but misses. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS435
01:01:37,00 --> 01:01:41,50
Taking off his socks, he nods. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS436
01:01:38,00 --> 01:01:44,50
Tossing the ball backward, SOMEONE<Ally> sinks another shot. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS437
01:01:43,00 --> 01:01:48,50
SOMEONE<Colin> gives her backward shot a try. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS438
01:01:48,00 --> 01:01:55,50
Now, SOMEONE<Ally> spins the ball on her fingertip. She sinks a shot while sitting on the floor. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS439
01:01:52,00 --> 01:01:56,50
SOMEONE<Colin> helps her up. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS440
01:01:54,00 --> 01:01:59,50
Sitting on the floor, he kicks the ball. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS441
01:01:56,00 --> 01:02:01,50
SOMEONE<Ally> reaches to help him up, but pulls away. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS442
01:01:58,00 --> 01:02:05,50
She sinks a three-pointer and her now shirtless friend retrieves the ball. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS443
01:02:03,00 --> 01:02:08,50
SOMEONE<Colin> shoots but misses the hoop. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS444
01:02:08,00 --> 01:02:17,50
SOMEONE<Ally> watches as he drops his jeans. Now wearing only boxers, SOMEONE<Colin> loops the ball under his leg and makes a layup. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS445
01:02:14,00 --> 01:02:20,50
Wearing her dress, SOMEONE<Ally> struggles to match him. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS446
01:02:21,00 --> 01:02:27,50
Her dress hits the floor. In her underwear, she returns with the ball. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS447
01:02:37,00 --> 01:02:42,50
She throws him the ball. He returns it to her. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS448
01:02:39,00 --> 01:02:45,50
Now, SOMEONE<Ally> dribbles around SOMEONE<Colin> and sinks a layup. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS449
01:02:42,00 --> 01:02:50,50
SOMEONE<Colin> dribbles side to side. He tosses the ball in the net and SOMEONE<Ally> catches it. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS450
01:02:51,00 --> 01:03:02,50
She bounces the ball between his legs and runs around him. The ball drops in the hoop three times. SOMEONE<Colin> holds her 	side, but SOMEONE<Ally> pushes him down and takes a shot. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS451
01:03:00,00 --> 01:03:07,50
He playfully keeps the ball away, then faces her, holding the ball behind her head. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS452
01:03:04,00 --> 01:03:09,50
They share a sensual gaze. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS453
01:03:06,00 --> 01:03:11,50
He sinks a shot and she pushes him. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS454
01:03:08,00 --> 01:03:12,50
He makes a layup. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS455
01:03:12,00 --> 01:03:18,50
A security guard marches down the corridor with a flashlight. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS456
01:03:15,00 --> 01:03:22,50
He scans the empty arena, but finds only SOMEONE's<Ally's> red dress hanging from the hoop. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS457
01:03:19,00 --> 01:03:25,50
Later at a marina, SOMEONE<Ally> wears SOMEONE's<Colin's> button-down shirt. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS458
01:04:28,00 --> 01:04:34,50
Following him, SOMEONE<Ally> drops her high heels and loses the button-down shirt. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS459
01:04:32,00 --> 01:04:37,50
They each strip out of their underwear, hurry to the edge of the dock, and 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS460
01:04:35,00 --> 01:04:39,50
stand side by side. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS461
01:04:36,00 --> 01:04:43,50
They share a gaze, then SOMEONE<Colin> offers his hand, which SOMEONE<Ally> accepts. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS462
01:04:41,00 --> 01:04:46,50
Together, they leap into the water. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS463
01:04:54,00 --> 01:05:02,50
They tread water within a circle of moonlight reflected on the rippling surface of the water, then swim for the dock. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS464
01:04:59,00 --> 01:05:06,50
Later, they return to SOMEONE's<Ally's> apartment and SOMEONE<Colin> shuts the door behind them. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS465
01:05:30,00 --> 01:05:36,50
As they face each other, he looks into her eyes, then lowers his gaze. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS466
01:05:41,00 --> 01:05:45,50
He unbuttons the shirt. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS467
01:05:55,00 --> 01:06:00,50
He opens her shirt, looks at her naked body, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS468
01:05:58,00 --> 01:06:02,50
then returns his gaze to her eyes. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS470
01:06:03,00 --> 01:06:07,50
They kiss, wrapping their arms around each other. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS471
01:06:09,00 --> 01:06:14,50
She unbuckles his belt and he pulls her close. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS472
01:06:14,00 --> 01:06:19,50
She backs into her bedroom and they fall on her bed. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS473
01:06:30,00 --> 01:06:35,50
He lies beside her and she covers up a bit. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS474
01:06:40,00 --> 01:06:44,50
He measures six inches with his hands. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS475
01:06:59,00 --> 01:07:04,50
They share an affectionate gaze, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS476
01:07:01,00 --> 01:07:05,50
then he kisses her again. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS477
01:07:08,00 --> 01:07:18,50
The next morning, our view descends to the bed, where SOMEONE<Ally> and SOMEONE<Colin> sleep facing each other, her hand gently resting on his cheek. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS478
01:07:15,00 --> 01:07:20,50
SOMEONE's<Ally's> eyes open gradually and she grows anxious. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS479
01:07:19,00 --> 01:07:24,50
She removes her hand from his unshaven face, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS480
01:07:21,00 --> 01:07:27,50
then rolls on her back and reaches for the brush on her nightstand. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS481
01:07:29,00 --> 01:07:33,50
She looks at him. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS482
01:07:38,00 --> 01:07:43,50
Smiling, she turns on her side. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS483
01:07:40,00 --> 01:07:44,50
SOMEONE<Colin> rolls on his back. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS484
01:07:43,00 --> 01:07:49,50
He rests his hand on his knee, then pats the bed. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS485
01:07:59,00 --> 01:08:02,50
She nods. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS486
01:08:03,00 --> 01:08:07,50
She falls off the bed. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS487
01:08:12,00 --> 01:08:21,50
She fills her purse with various items including one of two cell phones, then returns to the bed and gives SOMEONE<Colin> a kiss goodbye. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS488
01:08:19,00 --> 01:08:25,50
Later at a flower shop, SOMEONE<Ally> stands alone with an open binder in her hand. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS489
01:08:24,00 --> 01:08:28,50
Gazing thoughtfully, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS491
01:08:28,00 --> 01:08:35,50
She notices SOMEONE<Daisy> walking by with a clipboard and returns her attention to the binder. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS493
01:10:20,00 --> 01:10:24,50
Now in her apartment, SOMEONE<Ally> sits at a table. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS494
01:10:22,00 --> 01:10:28,50
Under a bright lamp, she painstakingly works on one of her sculptures. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS495
01:10:33,00 --> 01:10:40,50
She picks up a cell phone and reads a string of text messages starting with SOMEONE's<Jake's> phone number. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS496
01:10:38,00 --> 01:10:42,50
"You owe me big. Thanks. man. Hey SOMEONE, still no call. Did you pass on SOMEONE's number to Ally?"

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS500
01:11:03,00 --> 01:11:07,50
He kisses her shoulder. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS501
01:11:07,00 --> 01:11:13,50
He hops on the couch, then grabs a magazine from a coffee table and starts to read. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS502
01:11:36,00 --> 01:11:41,50
She drops the cell phone on him and walks out. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS503
01:12:10,00 --> 01:12:15,50
SOMEONE<Colin> puts his hands on his hips and hangs his head. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS504
01:12:13,00 --> 01:12:18,50
At the kitchen sink, SOMEONE<Ally> turns on the faucet. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS505
01:12:50,00 --> 01:12:54,50
She leaves the room. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS506
01:12:51,00 --> 01:12:54,50
SOMEONE<Colin> nods. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS507
01:12:55,00 --> 01:13:01,50
He storms out of her apartment and heads across the hall. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS508
01:13:12,00 --> 01:13:15,50
SOMEONE slams his 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS509
01:13:13,00 --> 01:13:17,50
door, then SOMEONE<Ally> does the same. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS510
01:13:17,00 --> 01:13:24,50
Now, indigo clouds drift across the sky as a low sun peeks over the horizon. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS511
01:13:22,00 --> 01:13:25,50
In her apartment, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS512
01:13:23,00 --> 01:13:29,50
SOMEONE paints a sculpture of a bride and groom standing at a wedding, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS513
01:13:27,00 --> 01:13:31,50
bearing a resemblance to SOMEONE<Daisy>. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS514
01:13:28,00 --> 01:13:33,50
The bride grins as she mashes 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS515
01:13:30,00 --> 01:13:34,50
the cake into her husband 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS516
01:13:32,00 --> 01:13:37,50
SOMEONE<Ally> pauses and shifts her gaze. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS518
01:13:35,00 --> 01:13:39,50
He uses her cell phone. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS525
01:13:45,00 --> 01:13:51,50
Now, a magazine clipping features a model with a poufy updo. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS526
01:13:48,00 --> 01:13:55,50
At a dressing table, SOMEONE<Ally> faces a mirror as she backcombs her hair. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS527
01:13:52,00 --> 01:13:59,50
In a closet, our view sweeps over a selection of expensive men's clothes. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS528
01:13:56,00 --> 01:14:01,50
A hand pulls a suit jacket from a rack. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS529
01:13:59,00 --> 01:14:05,50
At Ally's, another magazine photo shows a sleek ponytail. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS530
01:14:02,00 --> 01:14:08,50
Facing her mirror, the young woman copies the hairstyle. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS531
01:14:06,00 --> 01:14:11,50
She checks her profile and gives a dissatisfied SOMEONE<grimace>. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS532
01:14:09,00 --> 01:14:15,50
SOMEONE<Ally> picks up a blonde hair extension and brushes it out. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS533
01:14:12,00 --> 01:14:20,50
Later, she smiles at the reflection of her long smooth ponytail and flounces it against her back. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS534
01:14:17,00 --> 01:14:27,50
Grabbing a can of aerosol hairspray, she sweeps it in broad circles around her head, both clockwise and counter-clockwise. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS535
01:14:25,00 --> 01:14:33,50
In a rich man's closet, a hand pulls out a small drawer displaying a selection of expensive watches. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS536
01:14:30,00 --> 01:14:35,50
He picks one with a gold face. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS537
01:14:32,00 --> 01:14:40,50
Scrutinizing her reflection, SOMEONE<Ally> tucks a price tag into the back of her slinky black dress. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS538
01:14:37,00 --> 01:14:44,50
Now at an upscale restaurant, a fountain stands amid softly lit tables. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS539
01:14:42,00 --> 01:14:47,50
SOMEONE<Ally> sits alone at one of them, nibbling on a dinner roll. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS540
01:14:45,00 --> 01:14:51,50
At the table behind her, a waiter presents a dish flambÃ©. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS541
01:14:48,00 --> 01:14:56,50
SOMEONE<Ally> turns and her eyes widen as a well-dressed square-jawed man saunters in. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS542
01:14:53,00 --> 01:15:02,50
He pauses to greet acquaintances, then spots her. SOMEONE<Ally> grins and waves. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS543
01:15:00,00 --> 01:15:08,50
The fountain's jets of water blast upward as he approaches. Behind her, the flambÃ© flares. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS544
01:15:05,00 --> 01:15:12,50
As he approaches in slow motion, SOMEONE<Ally> nervously stands. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS545
01:15:09,00 --> 01:15:15,50
SOMEONE<Jake> pauses and turns to greet an acquaintance. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS546
01:15:12,00 --> 01:15:19,50
SOMEONE<Ally> frowns, sniffing the air, and looks around. Her ponytail is on fire. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS547
01:15:19,00 --> 01:15:26,50
As smoke wafts around her face, her eyes dart quizzically. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS548
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:28,50
She reaches back and pulls off the hairpiece. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS549
01:15:26,00 --> 01:15:32,50
She throws it into the fountain. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS550
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:34,50
SOMEONE<Jake> joins her. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS561
01:16:26,00 --> 01:16:29,50
SOMEONE<Ally> beams. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS563
01:16:28,00 --> 01:16:36,50
She strides briskly into a restaurant, where her sister smiles sheepishly at her from a table set for four. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS564
01:16:52,00 --> 01:16:57,50
A middle-aged man enters with a young woman.

01:16:59,00 --> 01:17:04,50
He holds a Smartphone.

He kisses Jacinda. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS567
01:17:28,00 --> 01:17:32,50
Now at their mother's house.

01:17:35,00 --> 01:17:40,50
The sisters go inside. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS569
01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:42,50
They find her in the living room. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS570
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:34,50
She shows a photo of SOMEONE<Ally> and SOMEONE<Jake> as teenagers. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS571
01:18:39,00 --> 01:18:43,50
She crosses her finger 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS572
01:18:42,00 --> 01:18:46,50
SOMEONE<Daisy> grins at her. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS573
01:18:44,00 --> 01:18:49,50
SOMEONE<Ally> looks back and forth between them, working her mouth. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS574
01:19:06,00 --> 01:19:10,50
She caresses their faces. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS575
01:19:21,00 --> 01:19:30,50
Now a couple runs through tall grass overlooking a beach. Tumbling down beside SOMEONE<Jake> and SOMEONE<Ally>, SOMEONE<Eddie> and SOMEONE<Daisy> make out. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS576
01:19:30,00 --> 01:19:36,50
SOMEONE<Jake> smiles at SOMEONE<Ally>, then glances uncomfortably at the couple. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS577
01:19:34,00 --> 01:19:40,50
Now he and SOMEONE<Ally> enjoy a date in formal wear. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS578
01:19:43,00 --> 01:19:47,50
Later at a formal event, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS579
01:19:47,00 --> 01:19:52,50
SOMEONE<Ally> smiles sheepishly SOMEONE<Jake>. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS580
01:19:53,00 --> 01:19:57,50
She takes a bite. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS581
01:20:00,00 --> 01:20:06,50
SOMEONE<Ally> takes two flutes of champagne from a tray. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS582
01:20:03,00 --> 01:20:10,50
Now from outside her apartment, we see her meandering to the window in a plaid shirt. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS583
01:20:08,00 --> 01:20:13,50
She sighs as she gazes out pensively. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS584
01:20:10,00 --> 01:20:16,50
Our view drifts up the side of the building to the roof 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS585
01:20:13,00 --> 01:20:18,50
where we find SOMEONE<Colin> standing alone. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS586
01:20:15,00 --> 01:20:19,50
He stares off, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS587
01:20:16,00 --> 01:20:22,50
one hand in his pocket and the other holding a bottle of beer. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS588
01:20:19,00 --> 01:20:24,50
Turning away from the view, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS589
01:20:21,00 --> 01:20:26,50
he takes a sip and sits on the couch. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS590
01:20:23,00 --> 01:20:28,50
SOMEONE takes up his guitar, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS591
01:20:25,00 --> 01:20:30,50
removes the pick from the fret board, and plays. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS592
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:35,50
Now SOMEONE's<Ally's> apartment door opens and she steps out carrying a white garment bag. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS593
01:20:32,00 --> 01:20:37,50
SOMEONE<Colin> leaves his apartment in a suit. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS594
01:20:35,00 --> 01:20:39,50
Seeing her, he halts. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS595
01:20:36,00 --> 01:20:41,50
SOMEONE spots him and hesitates, 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS596
01:20:38,00 --> 01:20:42,50
then affects a breezy smile. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS597
01:21:09,00 --> 01:21:13,50
He heads off. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS598
01:21:16,00 --> 01:21:22,50
SOMEONE<Colin> stops halfway down a flight of stairs. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS599
01:21:20,00 --> 01:21:26,50
As he continues down, SOMEONE<Ally> starts to speak, then stops herself. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS600
01:21:25,00 --> 01:21:30,50
She works her mouth, then leans over the banister. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS601
01:21:30,00 --> 01:21:34,50
He continues down without looking up. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS602
01:21:32,00 --> 01:21:37,50
SOMEONE<Ally> gazes after him remorsefully. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS603
01:21:35,00 --> 01:21:42,50
Now we drift over trees to find an immaculately kept lawn set up for a wedding. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS604
01:21:39,00 --> 01:21:46,50
Our view sweeps over the verdant estate to an upper window in SOMEONE's<Ally's> mother's house. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS605
01:21:45,00 --> 01:21:51,50
As we drift closer, it offers a glimpse of the bridal party's preparations.

The guests stand as SOMEONE's<Daisy's> mother walks her down the aisle. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS616
01:23:12,00 --> 01:23:19,50
The bridal veil catches in a flower arrangement and a guest helps them untangle it. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS617
01:23:32,00 --> 01:23:40,50
The bride and groom smile at the officiant, then face each other lovingly, and hold each other's hands.

01:24:42,00 --> 01:24:50,50

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS620
01:24:56,00 --> 01:25:02,50
Turning away from SOMEONE<Eddie>, SOMEONE<Daisy> grabs her in a sisterly embrace. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS621
01:24:59,00 --> 01:25:08,50
The other bridesmaids quickly join in, making it a group hug as the sisters' father snaps a photo. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS622
01:25:05,00 --> 01:25:16,50

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS628
01:26:12,00 --> 01:26:18,50
Their expressions grow pensive and they both face the stage.

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS633
01:27:49,00 --> 01:27:55,50
As they linger in the kiss, SOMEONE's<Ally's> eyes open and shift uncertainly. 

WHATS_YOUR_NUMBER_DVS634
01:27:53,00 --> 01:27:59,50
Looking on, her mother gives an approving wink and nod.

01:35:47,00 --> 01:35:58,50
