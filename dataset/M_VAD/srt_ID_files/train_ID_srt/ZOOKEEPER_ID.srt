ZOOKEEPER_DVS16
00:02:54,00 --> 00:02:58,50
Now, a title appears. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS17
00:02:57,00 --> 00:03:02,50
Boston. Zacum Bridge at sunrise. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS18
00:03:01,00 --> 00:03:10,50
In a residential neighborhood. Words appear, 5 Years Later. SOMEONE<Griffin> steps on to the porch of a modest three-story. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS19
00:03:10,00 --> 00:03:14,50
Now, at a junk yard. SOMEONE<Griffin> buys a waist-high tire. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS21
00:03:19,00 --> 00:03:25,50
Is guarding a grand entryway. Arched ironwork above reads "Park Zoo".  

ZOOKEEPER_DVS22
00:03:23,00 --> 00:03:30,50
Now, SOMEONE<Griffin> drives a golf cart with the tire in back. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS23
00:03:32,00 --> 00:03:41,50
Habitat enclosure. SOMEONE<Griffin> lowers a drawbridge over a moat and walks over to it. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS24
00:03:40,00 --> 00:03:45,50
He takes the monkey's hand. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS25
00:03:53,00 --> 00:03:58,50
Who wears a patch over one eye. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS28
00:04:32,00 --> 00:04:40,50
Worker dumps his bucket of lettuce over a waist-high wall and into the pit. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS29
00:04:40,00 --> 00:04:46,50
He unlocks a door which opens at the pit's floor level. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS30
00:04:48,00 --> 00:05:02,50
He rolls the tire into a barren habitat. A single shaft of sunlight shines down from the pit's high opening into the otherwise stark enclosure where a gorilla sits with its back to the door. SOMEONE<Griffin> hangs the tire from a rope on a tree. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS32
00:05:15,00 --> 00:05:20,50
He Stands then stumbles back over. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS35
00:05:24,00 --> 00:05:31,50
Later, in a lab, a willowy, SOMEONE<raven>. Long haired woman places an eagle in a cage. She sees SOMEONE<Griffin> standing at a dry erase board labeled Things to do. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS36
00:05:30,00 --> 00:05:34,50
He writes, Fix SOMEONE's<Bernie's> tree. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS40
00:06:39,00 --> 00:06:44,50
A heart monitor shows a flat line. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS42
00:07:03,00 --> 00:07:07,50
He opens a drawer and rifles through it. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS44
00:07:23,00 --> 00:07:28,50
He gets his hand down the lionessâ€™s throat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS45
00:07:33,00 --> 00:07:39,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> pulls out a crushed Red Bull can. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS46
00:07:49,00 --> 00:07:56,50
That night, a banner hanging over a party over the zoo reads, Congratulations. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS49
00:08:20,00 --> 00:08:27,50
His hand and pulls her into a tight embrace. Her eyes widen. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS50
00:08:41,00 --> 00:08:47,50
He gives a serious look. SOMEONE<Robin> smiles politely. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS54
00:10:03,00 --> 00:10:13,50
In the icy stand behind him. Scanning the crowd, SOMEONE<Griffin> spots SOMEONE<Stephanie>. In his perspective, she appears to pull away from the others around her. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS55
00:10:13,00 --> 00:10:17,50
SOMEONE's<Griffin's> lips twitch. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS57
00:11:12,00 --> 00:11:18,50
Venom cringes while Frankie hits play on a boom box. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS58
00:11:21,00 --> 00:11:27,50
SOMEONE<Dave> strides over to SOMEONE<Griffin>. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS59
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:34,50
He catches SOMEONE<Griffin> eyeing SOMEONE<Stephanie>. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS60
00:11:34,00 --> 00:11:39,50
Meanwhile, by the giraffe's enclosure. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS61
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:04,50
He perks up. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS62
00:12:35,00 --> 00:12:41,50
SOMEONE<Donald>, the Monkey watches them chat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS63
00:12:39,00 --> 00:12:45,50
Holding the porcupine, SOMEONE<Griffin> turns away. He yanks the quill out. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS68
00:13:43,00 --> 00:13:57,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> flinches. Smiling, she dabs his cheek. He stares at her with lovelorn eyes. She returns a tender look. SOMEONE<Donald>, the Monkey watches. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS69
00:14:03,00 --> 00:14:08,50
She gives a flirty smile. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS71
00:14:33,00 --> 00:14:41,50
She leaves. As SOMEONE<Griffin> stares after her, Floyd shoots a quill into his forehead. SOMEONE<Donald> chuckles. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS72
00:14:39,00 --> 00:14:48,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> winces and grits his teeth. He pulls out the quill. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS76
00:15:00,00 --> 00:15:10,50
A net swings from a horizontal arm at its top. The monkey leaps onto it, climbs down the pole and lands in SOMEONE's<Barry's> enclosure. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS77
00:15:08,00 --> 00:15:13,50
SOMEONE<Donald> creeps past a man-made waterfall. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS78
00:15:12,00 --> 00:15:16,50
The panel on it. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS79
00:15:13,00 --> 00:15:20,50
Swinging it open, he finds a power box inside and  

ZOOKEEPER_DVS80
00:15:22,00 --> 00:15:26,50
He flips a switch. A dog is licking himself. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS81
00:15:27,00 --> 00:15:39,50
on just his hind legs, SOMEONE<Donald> scurries down a path to a set of heavy iron double doors. He climbs up to the keyhole, glances around, then picks the lock. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS82
00:15:38,00 --> 00:15:42,50
Tilts and the doors swing open. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS83
00:16:08,00 --> 00:16:18,50
She stretches her neck into another enclosure where the rest of the animals gather at the base of a rock ledge. A lion steps out. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS84
00:17:11,00 --> 00:17:14,50
He eyes. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS85
00:18:54,00 --> 00:19:02,50
The next day, SOMEONE<Cate> peers into SOMEONE's<Bernie's> pit to find SOMEONE<Griffin> hanging a giant whiffle ball from the tree. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS86
00:19:12,00 --> 00:19:17,50
He spins it. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS87
00:19:20,00 --> 00:19:25,50
With a smile, SOMEONE<Cate> heads away. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS88
00:19:25,00 --> 00:19:30,50
SOMEONE<Bernie> keeps his back to him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS89
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:40,50
Later, with the giraffe. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS92
00:19:58,00 --> 00:20:07,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> gnaws on a carrot as he watches SOMEONE<Robin> and SOMEONE<Stephanie> walk away. The giraffe licks it and he spits it out. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS93
00:20:05,00 --> 00:20:11,50
She walks away from him and looks at the monkey. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS94
00:20:10,00 --> 00:20:14,50
SOMEONE<Donald> gives a thumbs up. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS97
00:20:29,00 --> 00:20:34,50
A wire basket drops from his hand. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS98
00:20:49,00 --> 00:20:54,50
Flailing his arms. The giraffe looks on. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS99
00:20:55,00 --> 00:21:00,50
He drops into the rock ledge and lands on his back. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS100
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:11,50
SOMEONE<Stephanie> and SOMEONE<Robin> board the golf cart. SOMEONE<Joe> peeks over the rock ledge and watches SOMEONE<Griffin> struggle to his feet. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS101
00:21:09,00 --> 00:21:14,50
Lion steps away. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS104
00:21:49,00 --> 00:21:53,50
His house and shuts the door. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS105
00:21:51,00 --> 00:21:56,50
Through his window blinds. On TV 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS106
00:21:53,00 --> 00:21:59,50
Teenage witch listens to her talking cat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS107
00:22:14,00 --> 00:22:41,50
The next morning at the zoo, SOMEONE<griffin> peeks into the lion enclosure and finds SOMEONE<Joe> lying on his haunches. The zookeeper awkwardly steps out and faces the indifferent lion. Keeping his eyes on the animal, he walks backward out of view again. Now, three kids stand at the lion enclosure. SOMEONE<Griffin> sets down a wheelbarrow, glances around then cautiously approaches. He watches SOMEONE<Joe> lounge on some rocks. The kids head off. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS108
00:22:39,00 --> 00:22:44,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> stares at the indifferent lion. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS109
00:22:46,00 --> 00:22:51,50
A couple passes by. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS110
00:22:50,00 --> 00:22:58,50
The lion while SOMEONE<Griffin> sweeps the sidewalk behind them. He mouths to SOMEONE<Joe>, What's up?

ZOOKEEPER_DVS111
00:22:57,00 --> 00:23:02,50
Later, a security guard rides a cart. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS113
00:23:28,00 --> 00:23:34,50
Exiting through a gate, he finds SOMEONE<Joe> the Lion waiting for him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS114
00:23:39,00 --> 00:23:44,50
Feet and falls on his back. The lion sighs. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS115
00:23:42,00 --> 00:23:49,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> lies unconscious under a few swaying elephant toys. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS118
00:26:13,00 --> 00:26:18,50
SOMEONE<Donald> licks his own armpit. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS120
00:26:23,00 --> 00:26:29,50
In his pit, SOMEONE<Bernie> the Gorilla glances up. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS121
00:26:27,00 --> 00:26:38,50
He turns away sadly. On another day, patrons walk around the zoo. SOMEONE<Griffin> enters the gorilla enclosure with a bucket and shuts the door behind him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS122
00:26:36,00 --> 00:26:42,50
SOMEONE<Bernie> sits with his back to him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS123
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:53,50
The somber gorilla sniffs the air. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS125
00:27:13,00 --> 00:27:18,50
SOMEONE<Bernie> gives no response. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS126
00:27:17,00 --> 00:27:25,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> ambles off with a bucket still in hand. The gorilla shifts his gaze. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS127
00:27:27,00 --> 00:27:37,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> brightens and glances over his shoulder. The gorilla rocks back and forth as the zookeeper sets the bucket down and exits. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS128
00:27:36,00 --> 00:27:42,50
Now, a boy chucks popcorn at the bears from behind a fence. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS130
00:27:52,00 --> 00:27:56,50
The boy lands in the enclosure. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS131
00:27:54,00 --> 00:27:59,50
He notices the two brown bears eyeing him hungrily. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS132
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:06,50
He jumps out of his golf cart. He runs halfway up a staircase. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS133
00:28:14,00 --> 00:28:21,50
Standing on their hind legs, the bears swap a look. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS134
00:28:22,00 --> 00:28:27,50
He walks the boy through a door. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS135
00:28:27,00 --> 00:28:34,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> shuts the door, makes sure no one's watching, then approaches the bears. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS136
00:29:28,00 --> 00:29:31,50
He walks for them. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS137
00:29:36,00 --> 00:29:40,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> lifts his hands. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS138
00:30:13,00 --> 00:30:17,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> walks crotch first. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS139
00:31:04,00 --> 00:31:11,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> notices the students watching him. SOMEONE<Cate> stands among them. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS140
00:31:09,00 --> 00:31:17,50
He briskly retreats. As the kids disperse, SOMEONE's<Cate's> concerned gaze lingers on her colleague. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS141
00:31:15,00 --> 00:31:22,50
In SOMEONE's<Bernie's> pit, SOMEONE<Griffin> slides over a bowl of popcorn for the approaching gorilla. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS142
00:31:36,00 --> 00:31:41,50
Shane enters through the metal door. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS143
00:31:40,00 --> 00:31:45,50
He squints at SOMEONE<Griffin> and SOMEONE<Bernie>. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS144
00:32:08,00 --> 00:32:14,50
Shane glances around then points at the gorilla. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS145
00:32:19,00 --> 00:32:24,50
He exits and slides the metal door shut. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS149
00:34:06,00 --> 00:34:10,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> turns to leave. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS150
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:23,50
With the wolf. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS153
00:34:49,00 --> 00:34:53,50
He pees on a pole. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS154
00:35:11,00 --> 00:35:16,50
He faces the pole. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS155
00:35:15,00 --> 00:35:19,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> shrugs. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS156
00:35:20,00 --> 00:35:24,50
Crosses to a tree. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS157
00:35:29,00 --> 00:35:35,50
The wolf crosses to a nearby fence, averting his gaze. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS158
00:35:35,00 --> 00:35:39,50
People walk by behind the fence. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS159
00:35:49,00 --> 00:35:53,50
The women quickly look away. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS160
00:35:51,00 --> 00:35:56,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> zips up. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS161
00:36:03,00 --> 00:36:08,50
The wolf lifts his paw. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS162
00:36:05,00 --> 00:36:10,50
He limps around SOMEONE<Griffin>. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS164
00:36:28,00 --> 00:36:35,50
SOMEONE<Cate> and SOMEONE<Rebecca> turn their backs. SOMEONE<Griffin> looks at the wolf. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS165
00:36:33,00 --> 00:36:38,50
He mouths the word sorry. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS167
00:36:40,00 --> 00:36:44,50
Shampoos the wolf's coat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS168
00:36:44,00 --> 00:36:56,50
Now, a jazz trio performs at a fancy restaurant. SOMEONE<Griffin> finishes urinating on a potted plant adorned with mini lights. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS169
00:37:02,00 --> 00:37:06,50
SOMEONE<Dave> taps him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS170
00:37:09,00 --> 00:37:14,50
Joins SOMEONE<Stephanie> at the bar. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS172
00:37:25,00 --> 00:37:29,50
As a guy approaches from behind. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS173
00:37:53,00 --> 00:37:57,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> heads off. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS174
00:38:08,00 --> 00:38:13,50
SOMEONE<Gale> turns back to SOMEONE<Stephanie>. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS176
00:38:25,00 --> 00:38:30,50
He furrows his brow as he considers. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS177
00:38:35,00 --> 00:38:39,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> sulks off. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS178
00:38:37,00 --> 00:38:42,50
Later, at the zoo. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS180
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:11,50
Sweeps past SOMEONE<Joe>. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS181
00:39:30,00 --> 00:39:35,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> looks from the giraffe to SOMEONE<Barry>. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS182
00:39:35,00 --> 00:39:39,50
He stands. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS184
00:40:04,00 --> 00:40:15,50
He gives a desperate look. Now, SOMEONE<Griffin> pumps his legs as he pedals a recumbent tricycle up a hill. An orange flag waves. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS185
00:41:01,00 --> 00:41:05,50
Semiâ€™s trailer. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS186
00:41:51,00 --> 00:41:56,50
Face plants on the cement. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS190
00:43:01,00 --> 00:43:06,50
As she rides off, SOMEONE<Gale> screeches to a halt. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS191
00:43:10,00 --> 00:43:14,50
He pretends to shoot an arrow. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS192
00:43:12,00 --> 00:43:24,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> gives him a baffled frown. SOMEONE<Gale> mounts his bike then rides away throwing SOMEONE<Griffin> a final glance. Nighttime in the lion enclosure. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS194
00:43:34,00 --> 00:43:40,50
SOMEONE's<Griffin's> eyes narrow. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS195
00:44:27,00 --> 00:44:31,50
SOMEONE<Joe> turns away. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS196
00:44:30,00 --> 00:44:39,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> nods at the lioness and heads off. Now, as SOMEONE<Cate> eats her lunch, SOMEONE<Griffin> stands at her desk. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS201
00:45:26,00 --> 00:45:31,50
Gorilla stops playing with his swinging ball and turns to find 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS202
00:45:28,00 --> 00:45:33,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> peering inside. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS203
00:45:32,00 --> 00:45:38,50
He enters holding a two-tiered orange cake with lit candles. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS204
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:05,50
Watches with a disbelief. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS205
00:46:13,00 --> 00:46:18,50
He starts to turn away. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS206
00:46:25,00 --> 00:46:32,50
Nighttime. SOMEONE<Griffin> leads SOMEONE<Bernie> up a staircase which emerges by the mouth of the pit. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS207
00:46:55,00 --> 00:46:59,50
They bump fists. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS208
00:47:04,00 --> 00:47:12,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> heads to a van in a maintenance lot. SOMEONE<Bernie> follows, now wearing a yellow polo. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS211
00:47:26,00 --> 00:47:34,50
Lights of downtown skyscrapers. SOMEONE<Griffin> points out the illuminated clock on the Custom House Tower. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS212
00:47:37,00 --> 00:47:43,50
His head out his window and watches the city whizz past. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS213
00:47:44,00 --> 00:47:50,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> bobs his head while SOMEONE<Bernie> holds his hand out. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS214
00:47:54,00 --> 00:47:58,50
With the music, SOMEONE pushes his door. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS216
00:48:32,00 --> 00:48:40,50
Grinning, the zookeeper climbs out. He hurries beside SOMEONE<Bernie> who gallops excitedly towards. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS217
00:48:39,00 --> 00:48:44,50
Inside, a waitress approaches their booth. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS218
00:48:45,00 --> 00:48:50,50
Eyes widen at SOMEONE<Bernie>. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS219
00:48:53,00 --> 00:48:57,50
He eyes his polo. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS220
00:49:04,00 --> 00:49:11,50
The waitress stares at SOMEONE<Bernie>. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS221
00:49:31,00 --> 00:49:35,50
SOMEONE<Bernie> closes his menu. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS222
00:49:33,00 --> 00:49:38,50
Frowning, the waitress leaves. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS223
00:50:47,00 --> 00:50:55,50
Returns from his game of pool and finds SOMEONE<Bernie> slow dancing with a blonde secretary in his arms. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS224
00:50:56,00 --> 00:51:03,50
She smiles dreamily and SOMEONE<Bernie> gives SOMEONE<Griffin> a thumbs up. The zookeeper smiles. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS225
00:51:02,00 --> 00:51:10,50
The two friends lie side by side on the roof of the van and gaze up at the glowing full moon. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS227
00:51:44,00 --> 00:51:51,50
His grin morphs into a frown and he furrows his brow. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS229
00:52:02,00 --> 00:52:08,50
Morning. At the zoo, a frog leaps off a ledge. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS231
00:52:48,00 --> 00:52:52,50
Puffs out his throat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS232
00:53:29,00 --> 00:53:34,50
He bows his head. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS234
00:53:52,00 --> 00:53:57,50
At the reptile enclosure. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS236
00:54:03,00 --> 00:54:08,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> sees an eyeball drawn on Frankie's eye patch. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS237
00:54:11,00 --> 00:54:16,50
Venom steps a little closer to SOMEONE<Griffin>. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS238
00:54:17,00 --> 00:54:21,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> glances down. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS239
00:54:27,00 --> 00:54:32,50
The frowning zookeeper hesitates. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS240
00:54:30,00 --> 00:54:39,50
He reaches into Venom's left pants pocket and digs around. SOMEONE<Griffin> shoots his colleague an uncomfortable smile. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS241
00:54:38,00 --> 00:54:45,50
The zookeeper reaches into his right pocket. He pulls out the keys. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS246
00:55:00,00 --> 00:55:05,50
Nodding along to the beat, he looks to an apartment building. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS247
00:55:04,00 --> 00:55:09,50
A woman's shapely legs head down the front steps. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS248
00:55:38,00 --> 00:55:44,50
He shifts his eyes pensively. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS249
00:55:46,00 --> 00:55:51,50
Wedding reception. Acrobats twirl from long swathes of. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS250
00:55:51,00 --> 00:55:55,50
Pictures of the bride and groom. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS251
00:55:53,00 --> 00:55:57,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> some champagne. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS252
00:55:57,00 --> 00:56:02,50
He spots SOMEONE<Stephanie> with SOMEONE<Gale>. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS256
00:56:24,00 --> 00:56:29,50
SOMEONE<Cate> holds out her open palm. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS257
00:56:28,00 --> 00:56:34,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> puts his hand in hers. She places. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS259
00:56:36,00 --> 00:56:41,50
Watches them move to the bar. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS260
00:56:43,00 --> 00:56:49,50
As SOMEONE's<Stephanie's> eyes meet his, he quickly looks away. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS261
00:57:16,00 --> 00:57:20,50
SOMEONE<Gale> holds a microphone. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS262
00:57:38,00 --> 00:57:45,50
To the DJ. SOMEONE<Stephanie> briefly hides her face then dramatically gets up. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS263
00:57:47,00 --> 00:57:53,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> mouths along to the lyrics as the couple starts dancing. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS264
00:58:06,00 --> 00:58:11,50
SOMEONE<Gale> and SOMEONE<Stephanie> square off from across the dancefloor. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS265
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:43,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> tries with SOMEONE<Cate>. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS267
00:59:17,00 --> 00:59:22,50
Return to their table. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS268
00:59:22,00 --> 00:59:29,50
SOMEONE<Cate> looks around the ballroom. SOMEONE<Griffin> slouches defeatedly. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS269
00:59:28,00 --> 00:59:36,50
She moves off and waves her arms at the DJ on a balcony, then returns to her date. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS270
00:59:41,00 --> 00:59:47,50
She takes SOMEONE's<Griffin's> arm and leads him to the dancefloor. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS272
00:59:51,00 --> 00:59:59,50
SOMEONE<Cate> grabs two of the hanging silk drapes. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS273
01:00:04,00 --> 01:00:08,50
And over one of his shoulders. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS274
01:00:08,00 --> 01:00:13,50
Playful smile, she grabs her own pair of drapes. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS276
01:00:16,00 --> 01:00:20,50
Then twirls in front of him trying. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS277
01:00:21,00 --> 01:00:25,50
Get SOMEONE's<Stephanie's> gorgeous. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS278
01:00:24,00 --> 01:00:28,50
He starts to sway a little. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS279
01:00:28,00 --> 01:00:33,50
Off her feet and swings. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS280
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:50,50
He were on a swing. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS281
01:01:00,00 --> 01:01:06,50
The other woman at SOMEONE's<Stephanie's> table turns to watch as well. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS282
01:01:07,00 --> 01:01:12,50
Spins around, but she swings over SOMEONE<Griffin> again. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS283
01:01:23,00 --> 01:01:27,50
As they move apart, we see SOMEONE<Stephanie> watching. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS284
01:01:30,00 --> 01:01:35,50
SOMEONE<Stephanie> turns to the woman at her table. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS286
01:02:52,00 --> 01:03:00,50
He frowns to himself as the groom walks off. SOMEONE<Gale> comes over and pulls up a chair. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS287
01:03:07,00 --> 01:03:14,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> blinks for a moment then sets his chunk of ice on the table. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS288
01:03:13,00 --> 01:03:18,50
He gets up from his seat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS289
01:03:30,00 --> 01:03:37,50
SOMEONE<Gale> stares at him aggressively. SOMEONE<Griffin> purses his lips and puffs out his cheeks. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS290
01:03:37,00 --> 01:03:41,50
And his pants split. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS291
01:03:42,00 --> 01:03:47,50
SOMEONE<Gale> walks off. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS292
01:04:31,00 --> 01:04:35,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> hangs up. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS293
01:04:40,00 --> 01:04:45,50
Her eyes widen as she swallows some food. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS294
01:04:50,00 --> 01:04:57,50
Moving his arms like a robot, he clanks a fork and knife together. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS295
01:04:55,00 --> 01:05:00,50
Stabs the steak off SOMEONE's<Stephanie's> plate. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS296
01:05:07,00 --> 01:05:13,50
He points across the ballroom then squints. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS297
01:05:20,00 --> 01:05:25,50
Meanwhile, a bartender hands SOMEONE<Gale> two drinks. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS298
01:05:24,00 --> 01:05:29,50
Spots him and heads over. The two rivals. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS299
01:05:31,00 --> 01:05:37,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> leans on the bar with a cocky smirk. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS300
01:06:32,00 --> 01:06:38,50
He unflinchingly stares down his rival. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS301
01:06:37,00 --> 01:06:44,50
SOMEONE<Gale> leaves him alone. SOMEONE<Stephanie> brings cake. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS302
01:06:43,00 --> 01:06:48,50
He flails his arms. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS303
01:06:45,00 --> 01:06:53,50
As he leaves, SOMEONE<Stephanie> puts down the two slices of cake and self-consciously hides her thumb. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS304
01:06:51,00 --> 01:06:55,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> grabs SOMEONE<Cate>. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS305
01:07:03,00 --> 01:07:09,50
A valet brings them the Mustang and they get in. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS306
01:07:38,00 --> 01:07:43,50
His pretty colleague beams. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS307
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:56,50
Finding SOMEONE<Stephanie> outside, he rolls down his window. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS308
01:08:25,00 --> 01:08:34,50
As he rolls his window back up, SOMEONE<Cate> frowns slightly. Staring straight ahead, SOMEONE<Griffin> remains motionless in his seat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS309
01:08:56,00 --> 01:09:00,50
SOMEONE<Cate> exits the car. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS310
01:08:58,00 --> 01:09:04,50
She holds the door for Griffins ex who climbs in with him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS311
01:09:15,00 --> 01:09:20,50
SOMEONE<Bernie> looks up at SOMEONE<Barry> who nods. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS312
01:09:49,00 --> 01:09:54,50
SOMEONE<Stephanie> pouts. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS313
01:10:13,00 --> 01:10:17,50
She perks up. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS314
01:10:47,00 --> 01:10:53,50
At the fashion show, SOMEONE<Stephanie> leads SOMEONE<Griffin> towards a man. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS315
01:10:51,00 --> 01:10:56,50
hair, who holds a Chinese crested. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS316
01:11:04,00 --> 01:11:09,50
SOMEONE<JÃ¼rgen> leans towards her. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS317
01:11:12,00 --> 01:11:17,50
SOMEONE's<Griffin's> brow creases. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS318
01:11:50,00 --> 01:11:57,50
Eyeing SOMEONE<JÃ¼rgen>, he rests his lips on his fists as if thinking. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS319
01:11:55,00 --> 01:12:00,50
SOMEONE<Stephanie> watches anxiously. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS320
01:12:15,00 --> 01:12:19,50
They ride in the back of a limo. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS321
01:12:28,00 --> 01:12:32,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> frowns. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS323
01:12:51,00 --> 01:12:57,50
As SOMEONE<Griffin> stares with crestfallen eyes, SOMEONE<Stephanie> leans. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS324
01:12:57,00 --> 01:13:01,50
He gives a dazed look. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS325
01:13:00,00 --> 01:13:06,50
Blinking, he turns away from her. The corner of his mouth lifts into an. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS327
01:13:33,00 --> 01:13:36,50
Tosses Glen the keys. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS328
01:13:43,00 --> 01:13:49,50
Holsters his invisible guns. As a middle-aged man exams a sports car. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS329
01:13:47,00 --> 01:13:53,50
Keeper stares with predatory eyes. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS330
01:13:52,00 --> 01:13:56,50
And exchange a glance. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS331
01:14:04,00 --> 01:14:09,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> faces the customer. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS332
01:14:15,00 --> 01:14:25,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> hits his head on the car's raised scissor door as he tries to climb inside. He hits his rear on the horn as he attempts to back into the seat. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS333
01:14:22,00 --> 01:14:27,50
Then finally slides his body. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS334
01:14:43,00 --> 01:14:50,50
Now, SOMEONE<Griffin> finds SOMEONE<Cate> standing outside the new eagle enclosure. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS335
01:14:57,00 --> 01:15:02,50
She looks in a cage. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS336
01:15:04,00 --> 01:15:10,50
An eagle flies out and perches beside another eagle. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS338
01:15:22,00 --> 01:15:28,50
Frowning, SOMEONE<Cate> shifts her gaze to the eagles. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS339
01:15:34,00 --> 01:15:39,50
She scowls at him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS340
01:16:18,00 --> 01:16:22,50
She meets his gaze. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS341
01:16:24,00 --> 01:16:34,50
Bowing his head, SOMEONE<Griffin> shakes it. As SOMEONE<Cate> watches expectantly, he lifts his eyes to hers and nods. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS342
01:16:32,00 --> 01:16:38,50
Her shoulders sag and she gives a disappointed look. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS343
01:16:37,00 --> 01:16:56,50
With a resigned smile, she leans against the railing around the eagle enclosure's glass observation wall and stares out at the birds. SOMEONE<Griffin> blinks at her, his lips parted in a discouraged expression, then glances at the eagles. As he walks off, SOMEONE<Cate> watches with heartbroken eyes. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS344
01:16:54,00 --> 01:17:04,50
Later, SOMEONE<Griffin> slides open the door to SOMEONE's<Bernie's> enclosure and peers inside. He enters with a box of popcorn in one hand. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS345
01:17:07,00 --> 01:17:15,50
With his back to the former zookeeper, SOMEONE<Bernie> sits facing the enclosure's far wall. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS346
01:17:32,00 --> 01:17:38,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> checks his phone's caller ID. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS347
01:17:54,00 --> 01:18:14,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> drops his pained gaze then returns it to SOMEONE<Bernie> who looks away. Shrugging his hands, the former zookeeper opens his mouth to speak then licks his lips and takes a step toward the door. He shoots the gorilla a final glance then leaves. Stepping into the corridor, he slides the door closed and starts. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS349
01:18:19,00 --> 01:18:24,50
He strides over to him. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS350
01:18:31,00 --> 01:18:35,50
Shane shifts his weight. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS351
01:18:44,00 --> 01:18:53,50
Under SOMEONE's<Griffin's> firm gaze, Shane swallows hard then nods. He returns a can of pepper spray to its holder on a. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS353
01:19:07,00 --> 01:19:21,50
Pushing the Ferrari's passenger seat forward, he indicates the trunk. His gray-haired customer gives an uncertain look. SOMEONE's<Griffin's> smirk fades as a bus pauses on the street outside. It bears an. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS354
01:19:19,00 --> 01:19:24,50
which reads, The eagles have landed. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS355
01:19:22,00 --> 01:19:27,50
Now, at the zoo. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS357
01:20:05,00 --> 01:20:12,50
Now, Venom holds two lizards as he approaches SOMEONE<Cate> who stares into SOMEONE's<Bernie's> pit. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS358
01:20:26,00 --> 01:20:31,50
SOMEONE<Bernie> overhears and frowns. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS359
01:20:49,00 --> 01:20:54,50
Venom gazes at her. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS360
01:20:51,00 --> 01:21:00,50
Closing his eyes, he puckers his lips and leans toward her. As he draws closer, he opens his mouth. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS361
01:21:15,00 --> 01:21:22,50
Later, SOMEONE<Griffin> enters a luxury condo and finds SOMEONE<Stephanie> doing yoga. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS362
01:21:34,00 --> 01:21:39,50
She beams at three balls in a row. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS363
01:21:45,00 --> 01:21:49,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> sits on the middle ball. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS367
01:22:31,00 --> 01:22:42,50
SOMEONE<Griffin> faces a floor-to-ceiling window and gazes out at the city. With a dispirited look, he trudges out of the living room. Now. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS368
01:22:40,00 --> 01:22:45,50
Door to SOMEONE's<Bernie's> enclosure unlocks and the gorilla. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS369
01:22:43,00 --> 01:22:49,50
Hopeful eyes. He watches as it slides open and. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS370
01:22:48,00 --> 01:22:55,50
Nail tipped stick. SOMEONE<Bernie> turns his back to the goateed zookeeper. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS371
01:22:54,00 --> 01:23:00,50
Stepping closer, Shane rests his stick on his shoulder. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS372
01:22:58,00 --> 01:23:04,50
He reaches into a pants pocket and withdraws an apple. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS373
01:23:03,00 --> 01:23:11,50
He takes a bite then hurls it against the far wall. Apple chunks explode over SOMEONE's<Bernie's> head. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS374
01:23:09,00 --> 01:23:15,50
Pepper spray. At the dealership, a salesman talks to his colleague. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS375
01:23:23,00 --> 01:23:31,50
The salesman's head swivel toward the customer. SOMEONE<Griffin> and Nimer exchange a look then both. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS376
01:23:35,00 --> 01:23:41,50
He heads to the door as Nimer greets the high roller. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS377
01:23:39,00 --> 01:23:44,50
SOMEONE<Stephanie> stands by the door. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS379
01:23:59,00 --> 01:24:04,50
She opens a velvet box. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS380
01:24:04,00 --> 01:24:09,50
Dropping to one knee, SOMEONE<Stephanie> falters then straightens. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS381
01:24:43,00 --> 01:24:49,50
As SOMEONE<Stephanie> stares, a mariachi band enters. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS382
01:25:06,00 --> 01:25:14,50
As she leaves the dealership, the band follows. Now SOMEONE<Bernie> sits in his enclosure with his back to the door. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS383
01:25:14,00 --> 01:25:19,50
He sniffs the air, his nostrils twitching. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS384
01:25:37,00 --> 01:25:46,50
Turning, SOMEONE<Bernie> finds SOMEONE<Griffin> back in a zookeeperâ€™s uniform. He smiles and SOMEONE<Griffin> gives a nod. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS385
01:25:54,00 --> 01:25:59,50
The crow lands on the pit wall. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS386
01:26:38,00 --> 01:26:42,50
SOMEONE<Barry> runs off. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS387
01:27:08,00 --> 01:27:12,50
SOMEONE takes flight. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS388
01:27:11,00 --> 01:27:17,50
In a parking lot, SOMEONE<Bernie> the Gorilla crosses to a van and open. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS389
01:27:17,00 --> 01:27:22,50
SOMEONE<Bernie> stands behind a fence. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS390
01:27:43,00 --> 01:27:46,50
Runs around to the passenger side. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS391
01:27:48,00 --> 01:27:54,50
Rolls out, heads into the road and drives straight into the side of a parked. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS392
01:27:55,00 --> 01:28:02,50
The van doors open and SOMEONE<Griffin> and SOMEONE<Bernie> step out to switch places. Manny unlocks the. 

ZOOKEEPER_DVS393
