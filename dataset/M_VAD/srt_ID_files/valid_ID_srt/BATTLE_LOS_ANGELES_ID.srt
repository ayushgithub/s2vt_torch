BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS22
00:03:07,00 --> 00:03:14,50
To a walk then stops. Altogether, his face dripping with sweat. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS23
00:03:13,00 --> 00:03:32,50
Later, SOMEONE<Nantz> turns to two younger Marines hanging out by the car next to his. One raises his sports drink in a toast. SOMEONE<Nantz> takes a bag of ice from a cooler, raises it in reply, then holds the ice to his knee. A balding Marine, SOMEONE's<Nantz's> age ices his neck. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS25
00:04:09,00 --> 00:04:14,50
SOMEONE<John> holds up a document. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS26
00:04:50,00 --> 00:04:56,50
SOMEONE<John> eyes SOMEONE's<Nantz's> signed request. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS27
00:04:57,00 --> 00:05:03,50
SOMEONE's<Nantz's> stares stoically. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS28
00:05:01,00 --> 00:05:06,50
SOMEONE<John> gazes at him. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS29
00:05:05,00 --> 00:05:11,50
SOMEONE's<Nantz's> eyes flicker to his friend's face. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS30
00:05:09,00 --> 00:05:20,50
SOMEONE<John> gives him a kind look, then adds his signature to the form. He closes it inside a service record folder and sets it in front of SOMEONE<Nantz>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS31
00:05:24,00 --> 00:05:37,50
Avoiding SOMEONE's<John's> gaze, SOMEONE<Nantz> stares downward with a wistful smirk. He nods. With a glance at his friend, SOMEONE<Nantz> reaches for his file and eyes it, his chest heaves. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS32
00:05:40,00 --> 00:06:01,50
Now, an American flag flutters beside an air traffic control tower. With his eyes fixed on it, SOMEONE<Nantz> salutes then mutters silent words. He lowers his pained gaze. In a flower shop, a TV shows a cluster of bright splotches in space, their size and intensity greater than the stars behind them. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS33
00:06:02,00 --> 00:06:13,50
The mustached trooper, SOMEONE watches with the bald, black Marine in thick-rimmed glasses. SOMEONE<Stavrou> sniffs a white carnation. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS35
00:06:28,00 --> 00:06:34,50
A woman joins SOMEONE<Harris>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS36
00:06:47,00 --> 00:06:53,50
SOMEONE's<Harris's> fiancÃ©e caresses his neck and ear. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS37
00:06:52,00 --> 00:06:59,50
They kiss. SOMEONE<Harris> turns to SOMEONE<Stavrou>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS39
00:07:08,00 --> 00:07:13,50
In a rec room, the African-American Marine Skypes with the young woman. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS40
00:07:26,00 --> 00:07:33,50
He punches SOEMONE's arm, then notices the man's hardened stare. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS41
00:07:31,00 --> 00:07:38,50
The lanky Marine, SOMEONE grins. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS42
00:07:43,00 --> 00:07:49,50
Now, one smooth shaving Marine sits in a psychiatrist's office. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS43
00:07:47,00 --> 00:07:54,50
His leg jiggling, he points to a bowl of pastel mints. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS44
00:07:52,00 --> 00:07:57,50
The Marine reaches for the bowl. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS45
00:07:56,00 --> 00:08:01,50
He withdraws his hand and the doctor smiles. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS46
00:08:03,00 --> 00:08:07,50
SOMEONE moves his head. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS47
00:08:17,00 --> 00:08:23,50
SOMEONE<Kerns> rumples his lips. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS48
00:08:23,00 --> 00:08:28,50
He taps his finger. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS49
00:08:28,00 --> 00:08:34,50
The doctor glances at him. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS50
00:08:31,00 --> 00:08:37,50
He writes notes in the Marine's medical file. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS51
00:08:40,00 --> 00:08:46,50
SOMEONE<Kerns> gives a frustrated look. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS52
00:08:46,00 --> 00:08:57,50
Rising, SOMEONE<Kerns> takes a handful of the mints. Now, the mocha-skinned Marine holds a golf club as he stands at a gravestone, Cpl. J. SOMEONE<Lockett>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS53
00:09:16,00 --> 00:09:21,50
He lifts the club. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS54
00:09:24,00 --> 00:09:30,50
Shifting his gaze, he blinks in the sunlight. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS55
00:09:28,00 --> 00:09:36,50
Crouching, he kisses his hand, touches the gravestone, then strolls away. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS56
00:09:34,00 --> 00:09:38,50
Night time. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS57
00:09:36,00 --> 00:09:41,50
SOMEONE<Lockett> in a golf course with a group of Marines. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS58
00:09:43,00 --> 00:09:48,50
Girls approach. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS59
00:09:52,00 --> 00:09:57,50
And whispers to another, who grins. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS60
00:10:22,00 --> 00:10:28,50
SOMEONE's<Imlay's> companion gives an impressed smile. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS61
00:10:27,00 --> 00:10:33,50
The boyish Marine swigs a beer. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS63
00:10:46,00 --> 00:10:51,50
Its tailgate, the boyish lend a hand and leans forward. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS65
00:11:17,00 --> 00:11:23,50
Gold bar she holds in her fingers. Her husband wakes up. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS66
00:11:25,00 --> 00:11:32,50
Later, he pins a gold bar to each of his collar flaps. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS68
00:11:42,00 --> 00:11:50,50
Stopping at the front door, SOMEONE<Martinez> turns and kisses his wife's pregnant belly. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS69
00:11:51,00 --> 00:11:59,50
Now, Marines ride inside a truck following a Humvee across sandy terrain.  

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS70
00:11:57,00 --> 00:12:02,50
Camp Pendleton, Training Grounds.  

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS71
00:12:01,00 --> 00:12:10,50
On foot, He halts. Spotting the Humvee and two transport trucks. He heads down the hill. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS72
00:12:09,00 --> 00:12:16,50
Hustling two by two, 20 plus Marines follow the staff sergeant. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS73
00:12:17,00 --> 00:12:25,50
They halt on SOMEONE's<Nantz's> hand signal. Two men hop out of the vehicles. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS75
00:12:26,00 --> 00:12:31,50
Into to the trucks, SOMEONE<Nantz> approaches SOMEONE<John>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS76
00:12:33,00 --> 00:12:38,50
They glance skyward. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS77
00:12:45,00 --> 00:12:50,50
SOMEONE<John> heads off. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS78
00:12:47,00 --> 00:12:52,50
He looks back. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS79
00:12:52,00 --> 00:13:00,50
Then shifts his uneasy gaze. Now in a hallway, SOMEONE<Martinez> walks with SOMEONE<Imlay>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS80
00:13:04,00 --> 00:13:10,50
SOMEONE<Imlay> faces the lieutenant. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS81
00:13:29,00 --> 00:13:37,50
In the Humvee, SOMEONE<Nantz> rides in the passenger seat while SOMEONE<John> drives. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS82
00:13:42,00 --> 00:13:46,50
They cross an airfield. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS83
00:13:59,00 --> 00:14:06,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> chuckles and shakes his head. He glances at SOMEONE<John>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS84
00:14:05,00 --> 00:14:09,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> greets SOMEONE<Martinez>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS87
00:14:38,00 --> 00:14:43,50
Bedroom where SOMEONE<Imlay> packs up. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS89
00:14:50,00 --> 00:14:54,50
He enters in the next room. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS90
00:14:52,00 --> 00:14:57,50
SOMEONE<Kerns> shoos SOMEONE<Stavrou> away. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS92
00:15:05,00 --> 00:15:11,50
SOMEONE<Imlay> interrupts SOMEONE<Lenihan>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS93
00:15:17,00 --> 00:15:23,50
Now SOMEONE<Martinez> and SOMEONE<Nantz> walk a hall. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS94
00:15:37,00 --> 00:15:41,50
A CNN report. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS95
00:15:48,00 --> 00:15:53,50
The Asian Marine chats up Guerrero. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS99
00:16:14,00 --> 00:16:19,50
Now units attend a briefing. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS100
00:16:26,00 --> 00:16:32,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> and SOMEONE<Martinez> swap a look. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS101
00:16:35,00 --> 00:16:40,50
A slide show. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS102
00:16:47,00 --> 00:16:52,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> glowers. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS104
00:16:57,00 --> 00:17:01,50
The Marines grab their helmets. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS105
00:17:03,00 --> 00:17:09,50
A newswoman reports from Santa SOMEONE<Monica> beach. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS106
00:17:39,00 --> 00:17:46,50
Among the troops, SOMEONE<Lenihan> watches the news. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS107
00:17:48,00 --> 00:17:54,50
Rolled ship, SOMEONE<Nantz> and SOMEONE<Martinez> watch. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS108
00:17:56,00 --> 00:18:02,50
On screen, a dissipating wave reveals dozens of aliens. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS111
00:18:23,00 --> 00:18:30,50
In Camp Pendleton Air Station, California, Marines hustle to waiting helicopter. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS112
00:18:40,00 --> 00:18:45,50
SOMEONE<Harris> shoots his head at Guerrero. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS113
00:18:50,00 --> 00:18:56,50
SOMEONE<Martinez> addresses his men. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS114
00:18:59,00 --> 00:19:05,50
Blocking Guerrero, on SOMEONE<Nantz>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS115
00:19:24,00 --> 00:19:30,50
Then Marines try to cross the airfield in single file. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS117
00:19:34,00 --> 00:19:38,50
Men file aboard. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS119
00:19:42,00 --> 00:19:47,50
SOMEONE<Lockett> lingers near SOMEONE<Nantz>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS123
00:20:08,00 --> 00:20:13,50
Stuffing a dog tag under his boot lace. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS124
00:20:14,00 --> 00:20:23,50
The uneasy rookie looks at a Marine to his left. SOMEONE<Kerns> chews a golf tee while reading a Bible. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS125
00:20:20,00 --> 00:20:26,50
Now it reads, "Through Christ Comes Freedom. " 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS126
00:20:26,00 --> 00:20:31,50
Guerrero calls to SOMEONE<Nantz>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS127
00:20:39,00 --> 00:20:49,50
Guerrero averts his gaze. SOMEONE<Imlay> eyes SOMEONE<Nantz>, who shares a tense look with SOMEONE<Kerns>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS128
00:20:46,00 --> 00:20:56,50
Writing a letter, SOMEONE<Martinez> wipes his brow with his thumb. With a black pen he writes, "My dearest wife. " 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS129
00:20:54,00 --> 00:21:03,50
Finishing, he folds the page and puts it away.  

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS130
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:07,50
The nervous lieutenant licks his lips then spots SOMEONE<Nantz> eyeing him.  

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS131
00:21:06,00 --> 00:21:13,50
SOMEONE<Martinez> wipes his face. Descending behind the oncoming helicopters. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS133
00:21:18,00 --> 00:21:27,50
Over three fading signatures, well in process. SOMEONE<Lockett> gapes, watching with SOMEONE<Kerns>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS135
00:21:28,00 --> 00:21:38,50
It shows craters and burning wreckage. A high aerial view, just after the chopper, shows smoke 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS136
00:21:37,00 --> 00:21:43,50
In the cockpit. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS139
00:22:08,00 --> 00:22:14,50
SOMEONE looks out a window. The city blocks and crowded injures 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS140
00:22:30,00 --> 00:22:35,50
Unit debarks. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS143
00:22:45,00 --> 00:22:50,50
The Marines enter a hangar. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS144
00:22:48,00 --> 00:22:56,50
The staff sergeant takes off his helmet. As the Marine crosses a busy command station. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS146
00:23:15,00 --> 00:23:23,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> checks his watch. SOMEONE<Martinez> shoots his concerned gaze. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS149
00:24:26,00 --> 00:24:31,50
The group disperses. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS150
00:24:31,00 --> 00:24:36,50
The unit stands outside. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS151
00:24:35,00 --> 00:24:44,50
More helicopters descend.  

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS152
00:24:42,00 --> 00:24:46,50
Now words appear, "Lincoln Boulevard: Marine Defensive Line. 2 hours and 47 minutes. until bomb drop. " 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS155
00:24:55,00 --> 00:25:01,50
He watches and walks in into the clear sky. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS157
00:25:03,00 --> 00:25:08,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> and SOMEONE<Lenihan> watch civilians pass. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS158
00:25:19,00 --> 00:25:24,50
With his child, pass SOMEONE<Nantz>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS159
00:25:25,00 --> 00:25:30,50
SOMEONE<Lenihan> advances. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS160
00:25:27,00 --> 00:25:38,50
Against the steady flow of evacuees, the unit reaches a street filled with abandoned vehicles. Down the street bombs burst where SOMEONE<Lenihan> is. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS161
00:25:37,00 --> 00:25:42,50
Unit walks through the thick smoke. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS163
00:25:48,00 --> 00:26:03,50
SOMEONE<Kerns> flinches. An object falls from the sky. SOMEONE<Martinez> raises his hand. SOMEONE<Nantz> does the same and the unit halts. SOMEONE<Nantz> signals for them to move on. SOMEONE<Imlay> glances around. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS164
00:26:10,00 --> 00:26:18,50
The unit steps out of the alley and crosses an empty street littered with household items. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS166
00:26:22,00 --> 00:26:34,50
They pass a pickup truck with an open passenger door. One Marine aims inside then lowers his weapon on finding the charred driver slumped against the wheel. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS167
00:26:32,00 --> 00:26:42,50
Now through a thick haze, several advancing Marines gradually appear. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS169
00:26:44,00 --> 00:26:50,50
Abandoned cars SOMEONE<mark> their path. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS171
00:26:49,00 --> 00:27:11,50
SOMEONE<Martinez> looks up from a map. Simmons aims his rifle. Through his scope, he sees a woman's body on the ground. Then a home's burning front steps. The unit moves on, spread out along the hazy street. SOMEONE<Nantz> keeps an alert gaze. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS172
00:27:10,00 --> 00:27:15,50
He peers through his scope. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS173
00:27:16,00 --> 00:27:26,50
The staff sergeant cautiously approaches a house where a body lies face down on the lawn. The others ready their weapons. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS174
00:27:23,00 --> 00:27:29,50
SOMEONE<Kerns> raises his rifle. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS176
00:27:32,00 --> 00:27:45,50
Through a scope, they peer across the haze. SOMEONE<Kerns> aims his weapon at a car then shifts his crosshairs through the right. As the German Shepherd trots out, he looks up. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS179
00:28:12,00 --> 00:28:16,50
Smaller fireballs in the air. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS181
00:29:38,00 --> 00:29:46,50
Guerrero through the haze, bullet shells fall on the dirt. Frozen with fear, SOMEONE<Martinez> looks around. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS182
00:29:47,00 --> 00:29:53,50
SOMEONE<Stavrou> stands up and barrels through a wooden gate. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS184
00:30:01,00 --> 00:30:05,50
He pulls him up. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS186
00:30:19,00 --> 00:30:24,50
They go through another door and head down a narrow path. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS187
00:30:28,00 --> 00:30:32,50
To an alley. Left behind. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS190
00:30:38,00 --> 00:30:46,50
He shuffles through a gate. The others barge in to another house. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS192
00:31:25,00 --> 00:31:31,50
He faces the Asian Marine. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS193
00:31:35,00 --> 00:31:41,50
SOMEONE<Martinez> swallows then glances aside. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS194
00:32:01,00 --> 00:32:15,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Lenihan> burst into an apartment building's laundry room. He limps past to rove the washing machines then lowers himself in a corner and uses his radio. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS197
00:32:39,00 --> 00:32:47,50
His feet with his gun raised, he knocks over a box of detergent which spills onto his head. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS198
00:32:48,00 --> 00:32:56,50
With a terrified look, the young Marine creeps through a blasted out hole in the wall. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS199
00:32:55,00 --> 00:33:02,50
With his gun ready, seeing a dryer, he relaxes. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS200
00:33:01,00 --> 00:33:16,50
The hole in the wall, firing wildly. Staring outside, he backs up to the laundry room door and feels for its knob. He opens it and then hurries outside. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Nantz> leads his group into the apartment complex. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS201
00:33:17,00 --> 00:33:23,50
The wall riddled with bullets then signals for his men to stop. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS202
00:33:24,00 --> 00:33:38,50
SOMEONE<Harris> gazes up at the building's roof then shares a look with SOMEONE<Imlay>. SOMEONE<Nantz> waves them on. In the courtyard, SOMEONE<Lenihan> adjusts the scope on his gun. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS203
00:33:39,00 --> 00:33:49,50
Staring down his gun's scope, he feebly sidesteps in front of some stairs which lead up to a pool patio. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS204
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:57,50
Swinging around, he aims his gun at the sky but sees nothing. Behind him, an alien emerges from the pool. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS205
00:33:55,00 --> 00:34:00,50
As SOMEONE<Lenihan> wheels around. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS206
00:34:05,00 --> 00:34:13,50
Then knocked it backwards into the pool. Sitting up, SOMEONE<Lenihan> notices smoke rising from his backpack. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS207
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:30,50
As he shakes off the smoldering pack, it fills the air with a thin haze. SOMEONE<Lenihan> gets to his feet, his rifle at the ready and limps up the stairs to the patio. Creeping to the edge of the pool, he aims into its rippling murky water. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS208
00:34:28,00 --> 00:34:35,50
Shadows move under the surface and he shoots. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS209
00:34:36,00 --> 00:34:40,50
Something moves below surface. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS210
00:34:42,00 --> 00:34:47,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> approaches him. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS211
00:35:12,00 --> 00:35:17,50
SOMEONE<Imlay> pulls the pin from his grenade. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS213
00:35:18,00 --> 00:35:26,50
Water dives in upward as the grenade explodes. Now SOMEONE<Kerns> spears around the building. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS214
00:35:24,00 --> 00:35:31,50
Marine Rally Point, 1. 3 miles to police station. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS215
00:35:28,00 --> 00:35:35,50
SOMEONE's<Martinez's> group creeps out after him. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS216
00:35:34,00 --> 00:35:47,50
From across the street, SOMEONE<Nantz> gives a nod. His men move out into the open, one of them limping. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS217
00:35:51,00 --> 00:36:04,50
SOMEONE<Lenihan> guides Guerrero, who wears a bloody bandage over his eyes. As the Marines head into the street, a fiery projectile streaks down. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS219
00:36:42,00 --> 00:36:48,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> presses a dressing to Simmons's charred neck. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS220
00:36:48,00 --> 00:36:55,50
He turns away. Through his scope, SOMEONE<Imlay> spots figures in the smoke outside. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS221
00:36:56,00 --> 00:37:01,50
He rushes through the open door. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS222
00:37:02,00 --> 00:37:08,50
A small group of soldiers emerges from the smoke. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS223
00:37:09,00 --> 00:37:19,50
SOMEONE<Imlay> beacons. The four friendlies race across the street and into the Ocean Lounge. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS226
00:37:26,00 --> 00:37:31,50
His uniform bears the name SOMEONE<Oswald>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS227
00:37:51,00 --> 00:37:56,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> eyes SOMEONE's<Santos's> gun. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS229
00:38:00,00 --> 00:38:07,50
SOMEONE<Mottola> looks over. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS231
00:38:11,00 --> 00:38:19,50
Now the group carries Simmons on a stretcher, passed the smoking SOMEONE<debris> of the demolished building. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS233
00:38:24,00 --> 00:38:30,50
A V formation of fighter jets passes overhead. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS235
00:38:30,00 --> 00:38:37,50
The portico at the LAPD's West Los Angeles Station. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS236
00:38:42,00 --> 00:38:48,50
They ready their ammo. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS237
00:38:48,00 --> 00:38:54,50
The others enter the station. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS238
00:38:52,00 --> 00:38:57,50
They sweep the area. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS239
00:38:58,00 --> 00:39:03,50
SOMEONE<Oswald> checks a body. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS240
00:39:02,00 --> 00:39:08,50
They approaches slowly. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS242
00:39:14,00 --> 00:39:21,50
The corporal tosses a grenade. In the station, the men creep down a dark hall. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS243
00:39:19,00 --> 00:39:26,50
As they near an open doorway, SOMEONE<Nantz> signals them to halt. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS244
00:39:24,00 --> 00:39:37,50
He points to his head then at the adjacent room. Behind him, SOMEONE<Kerns> nods. As they enter, SOMEONE<Nantz> sweeps a light from his rifle scope around the destroyed room. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS245
00:39:36,00 --> 00:39:50,50
It passes over legs of some upturned chairs which sit beside a pair of tall cabinets. Spotting movement through a gap between the cabinets, SOMEONE<Nantz> turns off his light. SOMEONE<Kerns> follow suit. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS246
00:39:48,00 --> 00:40:06,50
With his gun aimed at the gap, SOMEONE<Nantz> glances at him and points. He gives SOMEONE<Kerns> a nod then creeps closer. Moving past a desk, SOMEONE<Nantz> lowers his gaze to a dead man on the floor. He heads around the other side of the cabinets and turns his rifle's light back on. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS247
00:40:07,00 --> 00:40:12,50
The beam glows on a man and woman. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS248
00:40:20,00 --> 00:40:26,50
The group carries Simmons over on a stretcher. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS249
00:40:44,00 --> 00:40:48,50
They head inside. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS250
00:40:49,00 --> 00:40:54,50
They hug. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS252
00:41:05,00 --> 00:41:12,50
Lift off the ground, SOMEONE<Lenihan> cheerfully eyes his comrades below. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS253
00:41:17,00 --> 00:41:24,50
Overhead, a burst of fire explodes through the helicopter's windshield. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS255
00:41:33,00 --> 00:41:37,50
Raging flames. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS258
00:42:02,00 --> 00:42:09,50
SOMEONE<Santos> leads the civilians back to their original hiding spot. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS261
00:42:13,00 --> 00:42:20,50
SOMEONE<Harris> and SOMEONE<Doc> carry the dead man away. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS263
00:42:24,00 --> 00:42:30,50
SOMEONE<Santos> shifts her uncertain eyes. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS264
00:42:29,00 --> 00:42:39,50
Now SOMEONE<Harris> and SOMEONE<Stavrou> guard doors at the end of a hall. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS267
00:43:07,00 --> 00:43:15,50
His buddy weeps. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Nantz> approaches SOMEONE<Martinez> who listens to the sat phone. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS271
00:43:51,00 --> 00:43:56,50
He hits his chair. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS272
00:43:55,00 --> 00:44:04,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> steps closer, his eyes trained on the lieutenant. SOMEONE<Martinez> meets his gaze. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS279
00:44:47,00 --> 00:44:54,50
Jets soar through the sky. SOMEONE<Lockett> and SOMEONE<Kerns> take position on the roof. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS280
00:44:51,00 --> 00:44:59,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> tosses SOMEONE's<Martinez's> helmet then gives him a nod. Now on CNN. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS281
00:45:16,00 --> 00:45:22,50
He shines a penlight. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS283
00:45:25,00 --> 00:45:31,50
the father and his son find SOMEONE<Nantz> at the fountain. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS284
00:45:45,00 --> 00:45:51,50
SOMEONE<Joe> nods. His face somber. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS285
00:46:02,00 --> 00:46:08,50
He points to Hector. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS286
00:46:05,00 --> 00:46:22,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> salutes. SOMEONE<Joe> lifts Hector's hand to return him a gesture. Hector grins. SOMEONE<Joe> nods at SOMEONE<Nantz>. As the father and son leave, a mournful look crosses the staff sergeant's face. On the roof. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS287
00:46:24,00 --> 00:46:30,50
Aliens gear up on another rooftop. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS288
00:46:29,00 --> 00:46:34,50
One hovers over the other. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS291
00:47:06,00 --> 00:47:11,50
A CNN report. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS292
00:47:18,00 --> 00:47:26,50
One of the girls draws at a table. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS293
00:47:26,00 --> 00:47:32,50
The aunt holds SOMEONE's<Nantz's> gaze for a moment. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS297
00:47:57,00 --> 00:48:04,50
From the roof, SOMEONE<Kerns> eyes the destroyed city. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS298
00:48:18,00 --> 00:48:26,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> and SOMEONE<Martinez> move away from the others. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS299
00:48:45,00 --> 00:48:51,50
watches through his scope as SOMEONE<Stavrou> and SOMEONE<Harris> run outside. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS300
00:48:59,00 --> 00:49:04,50
SOMEONE<Imlay> rushes outside. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS301
00:49:03,00 --> 00:49:16,50
He leads SOMEONE<Nantz> and SOMEONE<Martinez> to a wounded alien amid charred SOMEONE<debris> right outside the station. Examining the body, SOMEONE<Martinez> notes a mechanical piece, seemingly soldered to bone. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS302
00:49:17,00 --> 00:49:24,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> pokes the alien with his gun. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS303
00:49:22,00 --> 00:49:27,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> shoots it, causing liquid to spurt out. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS305
00:49:31,00 --> 00:49:36,50
They drag the alien inside. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS306
00:49:38,00 --> 00:49:43,50
SOMEONE<Doc> rushes over. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS307
00:49:46,00 --> 00:49:51,50
The body to the back of the station. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS308
00:49:51,00 --> 00:50:06,50
She gives SOMEONE<Nantz> a nod. On the roof, SOMEONE<Kerns> and SOMEONE<Lockett> watch through their scopes as SOMEONE<Harris> and SOMEONE<Stavrou> climb on to the bus. SOMEONE<Stavrou> reaches under the dash. In the station, SOMEONE<Nantz> slices open the alien's chest. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS313
00:50:55,00 --> 00:51:01,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> stabs it and clear liquid spurts from a mechanical vent. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS314
00:51:06,00 --> 00:51:10,50
Stabs again, water spurts from tissue. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS315
00:51:10,00 --> 00:51:14,50
Use to hot wire the bus. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS316
00:51:13,00 --> 00:51:19,50
He looks at SOMEONE<Harris>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS320
00:51:36,00 --> 00:51:41,50
The vet leaves. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS322
00:52:05,00 --> 00:52:14,50
Now SOMEONE<Imlay> moves down a hall, peering through his rifles. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS325
00:52:33,00 --> 00:52:41,50
At the end of SOMEONE's<Imlay's> hall, a door swings slightly. An alien pushes through. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS326
00:52:41,00 --> 00:52:50,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> pulls away a thin stretchy layer of the alien's body, revealing a large watery sac. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS327
00:52:54,00 --> 00:52:59,50
Then fluid spurts out. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS328
00:53:15,00 --> 00:53:19,50
Grenade the hall and runs off. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS329
00:53:18,00 --> 00:53:25,50
SOMEONE<Santos> and SOMEONE<Nantz> grab their gear. Outside, the group rushes toward the bus. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS330
00:53:27,00 --> 00:53:31,50
They propel down the building. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS331
00:53:31,00 --> 00:53:35,50
SOMEONE gets down on the bus floor. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS332
00:53:43,00 --> 00:53:49,50
SOMEONE grimaces on the floor. SOMEONE<Nantz> looks around. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS333
00:54:03,00 --> 00:54:07,50
Some distant Palm tree. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS334
00:54:05,00 --> 00:54:10,50
Fires on the neighborhood below. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS338
00:54:24,00 --> 00:54:34,50
They share a grave look. SOMEONE<Martinez> wipes his brow with a gloved finger and stares out the windshield. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS340
00:54:42,00 --> 00:54:51,50
At the wheels, SOMEONE's<Stavrou's> gaze shifts upward. Mottola lifts his eyes from his rifle. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS343
00:54:57,00 --> 00:55:06,50
An abrupt stop jostles the passengers. The girls' aunt and SOMEONE<Joe> stare wide-eyed. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS344
00:55:04,00 --> 00:55:08,50
Fly overhead. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS345
00:55:10,00 --> 00:55:19,50
The soldiers and civilians alike duck down between the seats as more alien aircraft pass overhead. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS347
00:55:20,00 --> 00:55:29,50
Was aiming their rifle skyward, Mottola grips his radio. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS348
00:55:50,00 --> 00:55:55,50
The Marines turn off the radio. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS349
00:55:53,00 --> 00:55:59,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> focuses on a gas station up ahead. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS350
00:56:01,00 --> 00:56:06,50
SOMEONE takes a handheld radio and heads on. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS352
00:56:10,00 --> 00:56:19,50
SOMEONE<Martinez> crouches, his mouth agape and looks around. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS354
00:56:26,00 --> 00:56:31,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Nantz> skids. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS355
00:56:31,00 --> 00:56:37,50
and takes a rubber band from his wrist. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS359
00:57:01,00 --> 00:57:06,50
That heads in his direction. The staff sergeant raise. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS362
00:57:24,00 --> 00:57:30,50
It arrives at the station, he lobs the grenade. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS364
00:57:48,00 --> 00:58:07,50
SOMEONE<Martinez> gapes ahead at the black smoke and flames filling the street. SOMEONE's<Doc's> brow furrows. Behind him, SOMEONE<Joe> looks out with a worried stare. The blonde little girl lifts her head from the floor. Through the clearing smoke, SOMEONE<Stavrou> sees SOMEONE<Nantz> rise. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS365
00:58:10,00 --> 00:58:29,50
Obscured briefly by a tall flame whipping in the wind, the staff sergeant heads off. Hoofing it through a trail of flaming debris, he arrives at the destroyed aircraft. Fluid spews from several severed hoses. Aiming his weapon, SOMEONE<Nantz> examines the alien craft. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS366
00:58:27,00 --> 00:58:36,50
Later, he steps back on the bus. Leaning against the handrail, he rests his forehead on his hand. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS367
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:45,50
As SOMEONE<Martinez> looks him over, SOMEONE<Nantz> glances up at him. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS368
00:58:48,00 --> 00:58:58,50
SOMEONE's<Nantz's> right hand trembles. SOMEONE<Stavrou> gazes wide-eyed at the staff sergeant then looks up to SOMEONE<Martinez>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS369
00:58:59,00 --> 00:59:10,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> looks up at him. His gaze hard and his shake shaking uncontrollably. As he starts to pass by his superior, SOMEONE<Martinez> stops him. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS370
00:59:12,00 --> 00:59:20,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> nods with a little smile. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS372
00:59:31,00 --> 00:59:44,50
As SOMEONE<Martinez> gazes back at SOMEONE<Nantz>, SOMEONE<Stavrou> gets the bus moving again. In the back, SOMEONE<Nantz> bats off his helmet and earpiece and makes a fist with his shaking hand. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS373
00:59:45,00 --> 00:59:50,50
The vet approaches. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS374
00:59:48,00 --> 00:59:57,50
She nods appreciatively. SOMEONE<Nantz> gingerly touches a cut above his eye. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS378
01:00:10,00 --> 01:00:17,50
They share a little smile. She looks down at his hand. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS379
01:00:27,00 --> 01:00:40,50
She gives him a pat on the shoulder and leaves. Now the bus passes under a highway where several tanks sit burning. As SOMEONE<Nantz> gets up, SOMEONE<Santos> grabs his arm. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS384
01:01:06,00 --> 01:01:18,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> gazes at the tech sergeant then shifts his eyes thoughtfully. Now as the bus runs a corner, SOMEONE<Martinez> studies his map. SOMEONE<Nantz> joins him. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS386
01:01:29,00 --> 01:01:45,50
As the bus makes its way up a long curved on ramp, a couple of fighter jets soar overhead. On the freeway, littered with abandoned vehicles, the bus knocks cars out of its way as it rolls along. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS387
01:02:03,00 --> 01:02:10,50
10 Freeway West, 2. 5 miles to FOB, the bus drives 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS388
01:02:10,00 --> 01:02:15,50
The Marines all load fresh ammo clips 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS389
01:02:13,00 --> 01:02:20,50
The vet strokes the little girl's blonde hair. SOMEONE<Stavrou> looks back. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS391
01:02:22,00 --> 01:02:31,50
They pass a clearing in the smoke, to see a huge gap between the freeway and a section of off ramp. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS392
01:03:15,00 --> 01:03:25,50
A huge explosion erupts just a few yards in front of the bus. SOMEONE<Nantz> ties Hector's sneaker. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS393
01:03:26,00 --> 01:03:31,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> hurries to the front of the bus. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS396
01:04:05,00 --> 01:04:12,50
As he peers down from the resulting hole, another solider joins him. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS397
01:04:20,00 --> 01:04:24,50
Crouched at the bus's front door. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS398
01:04:30,00 --> 01:04:35,50
Towards the rest of the civilians. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS399
01:05:02,00 --> 01:05:07,50
As he falls, he knocks SOMEONE down 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS401
01:05:10,00 --> 01:05:17,50
On the ground, SOMEONE<Harris> stands up grimacing. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS402
01:05:32,00 --> 01:05:36,50
Helicopter. Meanwhile. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS403
01:05:34,00 --> 01:05:39,50
Astound an alien, as he hustles up beside 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS404
01:05:47,00 --> 01:05:53,50
an 18-caliber machine gun on the roof. Firing at the alien. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS406
01:05:56,00 --> 01:06:02,50
The car, SOMEONE<Kerns> smiles and lets out a sigh. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS407
01:06:00,00 --> 01:06:10,50
Rocket blast several cars near the tank. SOMEONE's<Lockett's> smile fades. SOMEONE<Imlay> and SOMEONE<Santos> look up from their rifle sights. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS408
01:06:15,00 --> 01:06:20,50
Around the little girl's waist. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS409
01:06:25,00 --> 01:06:30,50
Lowers his weapon and starts to run. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS410
01:06:31,00 --> 01:06:36,50
Blasting the SUV out. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS411
01:06:34,00 --> 01:06:39,50
The vehicle flips, crushing the soldier. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS414
01:07:14,00 --> 01:07:21,50
As SOMEONE<Stavrou> yanks SOMEONE<Santos> free, he falls back down on the roof. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS415
01:07:18,00 --> 01:07:23,50
The alien missile zipping toward

01:08:33,00 --> 01:08:39,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> looks him over. By the chopper, an alien bullet 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS426
01:08:43,00 --> 01:08:50,50
Behind the helicopter, SOMEONE<Doc> and the vet help him. SOMEONE<Joe> sees an alien

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS428
01:08:53,00 --> 01:09:00,50
SOMEONE<Joe> leaves the distracted corpsman and grabs Mottola's gun. He kills the alien. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS429
01:09:01,00 --> 01:09:08,50
The vet hurries to him with some bandages. Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Nantz> shoot

01:09:52,00 --> 01:09:58,50
SOMEONE<Martinez> takes the letter from his pocket. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS434
01:09:58,00 --> 01:10:05,50
As he passes the letter over, the men grip hands. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS435
01:10:03,00 --> 01:10:10,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> looks him in the eye and gives a slight nod. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS436
01:10:08,00 --> 01:10:15,50
SOMEONE<Martinez> watches the staff sergeant go. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS437
01:10:14,00 --> 01:10:18,50
As TNT sets up.

He aims a bag of C-4. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS440
01:10:36,00 --> 01:10:41,50
And watches the aliens draw closer. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS441
01:10:39,00 --> 01:10:49,50
He sits back in the doorway, clutching a radio. SOMEONE<Nantz> watches from his position, several yards away. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS442
01:10:54,00 --> 01:10:58,50
Then he squeezes the detonator. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS443
01:10:59,00 --> 01:11:07,50
Blows the bus apart. SOMEONE<Nantz> shuts his eyes. The smoke clears 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS444
01:11:04,00 --> 01:11:11,50
and the Marines lift their heads, looking around. SOMEONE<Nantz> gets up. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS445
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:18,50
As the rest of the group slowly rise to their feet, SOMEONE<Nantz> gazes solemnly toward the bus. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS446
01:11:15,00 --> 01:11:24,50
The vet looks over her shoulder. Getting to his feet, SOMEONE<Doc> squints at the flaming remains of the bus. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS447
01:11:23,00 --> 01:11:30,50
SOMEONE<Imlay> stares. His lips parted above his helmet's chin strap. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS448
01:11:28,00 --> 01:11:34,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> gingerly approaches the wreckage. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS449
01:11:35,00 --> 01:11:43,50
He finds some charred remains by the door. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS450
01:11:43,00 --> 01:11:49,50
He lifts his head and gazes over his shoulder and his men. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS451
01:11:50,00 --> 01:11:57,50
Lowering his eyes and tightening his lips, he heads back toward the group. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS452
01:11:59,00 --> 01:12:06,50
He marches pass the soldiers, who stand there, staring at him. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS453
01:12:04,00 --> 01:12:11,50
SOMEONE<Lockett> stays motionless, following the staff sergeant with his eyes. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS454
01:12:18,00 --> 01:12:26,50
Now, as they walk amid burning buildings, a battle rages overhead. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS455
01:12:24,00 --> 01:12:32,50
They arrive in a supermarket. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS460
01:12:46,00 --> 01:13:03,50
Several Marines and the vet lower SOMEONE<Joe> to the floor. The injured man winces, his face pale and sweaty. In a backroom, SOMEONE<Harris> sweeps his rifle past storage boxes and an office desk. SOMEONE<Santos> and SOMEONE<Kerns> approach. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS462
01:13:04,00 --> 01:13:09,50
She picks up a phone. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS463
01:13:07,00 --> 01:13:13,50

SOMEONE<Doc> dresses the wound. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS467
01:13:40,00 --> 01:13:47,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> softly nods. He helps with the bandage. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS468
01:13:50,00 --> 01:13:55,50
The Marines share a look. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS469
01:14:02,00 --> 01:14:11,50
The staff sergeant wipes the wounded civilian's brow then sits back and unscrews a water bottle. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS473
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:42,50
SOMEONE<Joe> lifts his trembling hand. SOMEONE<Doc> eyes his superior. SOMEONE<Nantz> glances at the Marine and grips the wounded man's hand. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS474
01:14:45,00 --> 01:14:51,50
The staff sergeant holds his gaze. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS475
01:14:53,00 --> 01:14:59,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> grabs his helmet. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS476
01:14:57,00 --> 01:15:11,50
SOMEONE<Doc> unfolds a foil blanket. Now news footage. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS478
01:15:19,00 --> 01:15:28,50
SOMEONE<Santos> watches on. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS483
01:15:47,00 --> 01:15:53,50
On screen, a giant craft hovers. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS485
01:16:00,00 --> 01:16:06,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> meets her gaze and she nods. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS487
01:16:07,00 --> 01:16:11,50
Put SOMEONE<Joe> into the backroom.

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS492
01:16:46,00 --> 01:16:56,50
The vet kisses one of the crying girls on the head. And then he closes his eyes. Joe, Lockett, and SOMEONE<Doc> watch the clock. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS493
01:16:55,00 --> 01:17:00,50
The second hand ticks toward the 12. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS494
01:17:00,00 --> 01:17:07,50
SOMEONE<Santos> helps shield the girls. SOMEONE<Imlay> clutches his helmet.

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS499
01:17:47,00 --> 01:18:10,50
Hector helps the Marines carry SOMEONE<Joe>. SOMEONE<Nantz> hurriedly ushers everyone out. Now black smoke fills the night sky. Words appear, "Santa SOMEONE Airport FOB. " Flames rise from the burning wreckage, a various aircraft and vehicles littering the runway. The group stares from a chain-link fence. SOMEONE<Nantz> steps forward, breathing heavily. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS500
01:18:14,00 --> 01:18:21,50
A map, later SOMEONE<Imlay> shines a flashlight across the abandoned hangar. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS501
01:18:19,00 --> 01:18:23,50
The group enters. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS502
01:18:22,00 --> 01:18:31,50
They carry SOMEONE<Joe> into a tent and set him down. Outside, SOMEONE<Harris> hangs his hat. SOMEONE<Kerns> paces. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS503
01:18:32,00 --> 01:18:40,50
SOMEONE<Imlay> faces SOMEONE<Lockett>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS505
01:18:40,00 --> 01:18:46,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> walks with SOMEONE<Santos>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS506
01:18:50,00 --> 01:18:56,50
Brightening a little, the staff sergeant flows to a stop. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS507
01:18:55,00 --> 01:19:00,50
He crosses the hangar. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS508
01:19:05,00 --> 01:19:14,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> leads SOMEONE<Imlay> up a staircase, down an open walkway, overlooking the hangar and into an office. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS509
01:19:16,00 --> 01:19:28,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> rifles through paperwork. In the hangar, two Marines set a dead body on the floor with three others. Checking SOMEONE's<Joe's> pulse, SOMEONE<Doc> looks at Hector. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS510
01:19:29,00 --> 01:19:37,50
The boy glances at him as he steps out. Left alone, Hector holds his father's limp hand. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS513
01:19:49,00 --> 01:19:55,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> points to a location. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS514
01:19:55,00 --> 01:20:01,50
SOMEONE<Doc> enters and takes off his helmet. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS515
01:20:01,00 --> 01:20:06,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> glances out. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS516
01:20:08,00 --> 01:20:18,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> and SOMEONE<Imlay> look up from the map and gape at the Marine. SOMEONE<Nantz> drops his head to his hands then pounds on the table. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS517
01:20:16,00 --> 01:20:29,50
The frustrated staff sergeant leaves the map and ambles across the office. Reaching the walkway, he watches SOMEONE<Joe> and Hector through an open flap on the side of the tent. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS518
01:20:27,00 --> 01:20:34,50
His chest heaves. Hector sits over his father. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS519
01:20:36,00 --> 01:20:44,50
He lays his head on his father's chest. Grimacing, he grabs SOMEONE's<Joe's> shirt. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS520
01:20:48,00 --> 01:20:57,50
The vet kneels beside Hector. She gently lays a hand on SOMEONE's<Joe's> forehead and caresses the back of the boy's head with the other. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS521
01:20:57,00 --> 01:21:02,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> and SOMEONE<Doc> cross the hangar. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS522
01:21:01,00 --> 01:21:06,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> approaches. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS523
01:21:07,00 --> 01:21:13,50
Hector runs out of the tent. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS524
01:21:11,00 --> 01:21:19,50
He faces the staff sergeant then hugs him. SOMEONE<Nantz> looks to SOMEONE<Doc> and the vet. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS525
01:21:20,00 --> 01:21:30,50
As the boy clings to him, he glances uncomfortably at the brunette. SOMEONE<Doc> wanders pass them, holding his helmet. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS526
01:21:30,00 --> 01:21:36,50
The vet gives SOMEONE<Nantz> an encouraging nod. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS527
01:21:33,00 --> 01:21:43,50
He glances at SOMEONE<Doc>, who sits nearby with a somber gaze. SOMEONE<Nantz> kneels in front of the boy. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS528
01:21:46,00 --> 01:21:51,50

SOMEONE<Nantz> gazes into the boy's eyes. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS530
01:22:11,00 --> 01:22:18,50
Across the hangar, SOMEONE<Kerns> lowers his gaze. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS531
01:22:25,00 --> 01:22:30,50
SOMEONE<Imlay> and SOMEONE<Lockett> watch them. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS532
01:22:33,00 --> 01:22:39,50
The tearful vet hangs her head. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS533
01:22:42,00 --> 01:22:47,50
The boy hugs him. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS534
01:22:45,00 --> 01:22:50,50
The vet steps in. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS535
01:22:50,00 --> 01:23:02,50
She leads Hector to the girls, who sit nearby. SOMEONE<Nantz> remains on one knee. He draws a tense breath then looks at SOMEONE<Kerns> and the other Marines. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS536
01:23:01,00 --> 01:23:10,50
He wipes his face then stands up and marches around a media station with a charred map tacked on a board. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS537
01:23:11,00 --> 01:23:17,50
He continues past his fellow Marines. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS538
01:23:16,00 --> 01:23:22,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> stops and looks back at SOMEONE<Lockett>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS539
01:23:23,00 --> 01:23:33,50
SOMEONE<Kerns> swaps a concerned look with SOMEONE<Imlay>. SOMEONE<Nantz> walks up to the disgruntled Marine and faces him squarely. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS540
01:23:35,00 --> 01:23:42,50
On watch duty, SOMEONE<Harris> and SOMEONE<Santos> each look back at the hangar. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS541
01:23:53,00 --> 01:24:01,50
SOMEONE<Lockett> holds his gaze. SOMEONE<Nantz> spots SOMEONE<Doc> watching them from the tent. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS542
01:24:19,00 --> 01:24:28,50
He points to his temple then gets into SOMEONE's<Lockett's> face. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS544
01:24:44,00 --> 01:24:50,50
SOMEONE<Lockett> keeps his glaring eyes steady. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS545
01:25:27,00 --> 01:25:32,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> steps away from the corporal. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS546
01:25:30,00 --> 01:25:37,50
SOMEONE<Lockett> wipes a tear from his scarred cheek and hangs his head. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS547
01:25:40,00 --> 01:25:47,50
SOMEONE<Imlay> glances at SOMEONE<Kerns>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS548
01:25:50,00 --> 01:25:55,50
SOMEONE<Harris> listens. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS549
01:26:17,00 --> 01:26:22,50
Later on the tarmac. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS550
01:26:22,00 --> 01:26:28,50
SOMEONE<Kerns> collect ammunition from dead bodies. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS551
01:26:27,00 --> 01:26:36,50
SOMEONE<Kerns> pockets a magazine. From a watch tower, SOMEONE<Nantz> and SOMEONE<Imlay> look over the extent of the destruction. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS552
01:26:37,00 --> 01:26:44,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> peers through binoculars. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS555
01:26:55,00 --> 01:27:00,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> lowers his binoculars. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS558
01:27:41,00 --> 01:27:49,50
Hops into a Humvee. Inside the LAV, SOMEONE<Nantz> sits behind SOMEONE<Kerns>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS565
01:28:10,00 --> 01:28:17,50
Returns and looks through an opening into the back. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS566
01:28:15,00 --> 01:28:21,50
With SOMEONE<Doc>, the vet nods. SOMEONE<Nantz> studies the map. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS567
01:28:20,00 --> 01:28:25,50
SOMEONE<Kerns> cranks the stirring wheel. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS570
01:28:36,00 --> 01:28:41,50
Tears on screen. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS571
01:28:42,00 --> 01:28:46,50
SOMEONE<Doc> comforts the blonde girl. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS579
01:30:07,00 --> 01:30:14,50
A helicopter hovers overhead. The vet looks up. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS580
01:30:17,00 --> 01:30:26,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> climbs out. SOMEONE<Kerns> takes off his helmet. Outside, SOMEONE<Santos> steps around the Humvee. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS581
01:30:33,00 --> 01:30:39,50
They rush to the helicopter, where a crew chief meets them. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS583
01:30:55,00 --> 01:31:00,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> spots him. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS584
01:31:00,00 --> 01:31:05,50
SOMEONE<Imlay> climbs aboard with the civilians. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS585
01:31:03,00 --> 01:31:10,50
His fellow soldiers. Hector sits on the vet's lap. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS587
01:31:13,00 --> 01:31:24,50
Staff sergeant looks over the area and glances skyward. The helicopter rises above the sandbag bunker and over the desolate lot. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS588
01:31:21,00 --> 01:31:49,50
As SOMEONE<Imlay> peers through a binocular, SOMEONE<Nantz> shifts his troubled gaze. Beyond the chopper, scattered fires light up the sprawling city. In distant downtown skyscrapers burn like Roman candles. SOMEONE<Nantz> adjusts his helmet above his narrowed eyes. The weary, disheveled group sits, huddled in the cabin. As the teary eyed sisters sit together watching the war-torn city, SOMEONE<Santos> eyes them. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS589
01:31:50,00 --> 01:31:55,50
Passengers brace themselves. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS591
01:32:05,00 --> 01:32:10,50
SOMEONE<Imlay> peers through his binocular. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS594
01:32:55,00 --> 01:33:01,50
The staff sergeant faces forward. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS595
01:32:58,00 --> 01:33:05,50
He takes out a folded piece of paper and shows it to the vet. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS596
01:33:08,00 --> 01:33:15,50
She glances at the letter then takes it and nods. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS597
01:33:13,00 --> 01:33:21,50
Then covers her hand with his own and shakes it. He leaves his seat and taps the crew chief. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS599
01:33:41,00 --> 01:33:48,50
He drops a long rope from the side door then faces Hector. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS600
01:33:48,00 --> 01:33:56,50
He falls out of the helicopter and slides down the rope to a deserted lot. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS601
01:33:54,00 --> 01:34:19,50
The staff sergeant glances around then faces a fire burning several yards away. A second rope drops from above. As SOMEONE<Nantz> heads off, SOMEONE<Imlay> slides to the ground and catches his attention. He watches two more Marines descend from the chopper. SOMEONE<Lockett> lands then trots past his staff sergeant and nods. Two more Marines touch ground. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS602
01:34:17,00 --> 01:34:22,50
SOMEONE<Santos> slides down a rope. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS603
01:34:20,00 --> 01:34:31,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> looks over his team and leads them across the lot. The helicopter rises overhead into the night sky. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS604
01:34:32,00 --> 01:34:39,50
Now SOMEONE<Nantz> glances around as he leads his unit below an overpass. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS605
01:34:36,00 --> 01:34:43,50
He drops to one knee and the others follow suit. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS606
01:34:57,00 --> 01:35:02,50
He consults a map. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS607
01:35:03,00 --> 01:35:08,50
SOMEONE<Imlay> nods. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS608
01:35:09,00 --> 01:35:16,50
SOMEONE<Santos> shifts her thoughtful eyes. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS609
01:35:13,00 --> 01:35:18,50
They rise. Then they run. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS611
01:35:38,00 --> 01:35:43,50
They carry equipment into a concrete tunnel. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS613
01:36:06,00 --> 01:36:31,50
With glowing orange bases. As the aliens leave, SOMEONE<Nantz> steps out of the shadows. The group creeps forward, passing the glowing cones. Each of which holds three antenna-like spears in its peak. An antenna shaft glows red as a crackle of electricity pulses out of it. Halting the unit, SOMEONE<Nantz> watches the shadow of the departing alien then waves the others forward. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS614
01:36:29,00 --> 01:36:38,50
They reach an atrium in the tunnel system, where more of the glowing devices rest on its flooded floor. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS615
01:36:47,00 --> 01:36:54,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> glances over his shoulder, his eyes searching the hazy area. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS618
01:37:15,00 --> 01:37:23,50
He leans, knocks a panel off a wall as it drops, revealing a room on the other side. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS619
01:37:24,00 --> 01:37:38,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> gazes into the high ceiling chamber, where a giant craft sits inside. It shapes similar to a balloon. Two jacking towers jet from its tower, protruding through a hole in the ceiling. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS621
01:37:41,00 --> 01:37:46,50
They go away from the opening. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS622
01:37:56,00 --> 01:38:03,50
As an alien draws closer, the rest of the unit climbs up the street level. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS624
01:38:10,00 --> 01:38:15,50
Holds the pin from a grenade. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS625
01:38:18,00 --> 01:38:24,50
The alien scoops it up and then it explodes. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS626
01:38:21,00 --> 01:38:27,50
Flames burst into the air behind SOMEONE<Nantz> and his unit. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS628
01:38:27,00 --> 01:38:35,50
They take cover behind and SOMEONE assembles a handheld laser target designator. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS629
01:39:03,00 --> 01:39:08,50
SOMEONE<Kerns> nods and SOMEONE<Nantz> eyes the others. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS630
01:39:20,00 --> 01:39:26,50
SOMEONE<Kerns> glances up at some soaring drums as he makes his way to a crumbled building. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS631
01:39:25,00 --> 01:39:33,50
Hide another destroyed building, SOMEONE<Harris> crouches in a doorway while SOMEONE<Santos> adjusts her gun. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS632
01:39:44,00 --> 01:39:48,50
He climbs the stairs. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS633
01:39:46,00 --> 01:39:54,50
Races up the remains of the building's only surviving stairwell, he takes out his radio. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS634
01:39:54,00 --> 01:40:01,50
He glances at SOMEONE<Nantz> and blocks it below. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS635
01:40:19,00 --> 01:40:24,50
As he discards the radio and peers below. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS636
01:40:30,00 --> 01:40:38,50
They shelter behind the slanted concrete slab, SOMEONE<Nantz> turns on the laser designator and aims it. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS637
01:40:38,00 --> 01:40:44,50
SOMEONE<Kerns> spots an alien approaching SOMEONE<Nantz> and shoots it. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS638
01:40:53,00 --> 01:40:59,50
SOMEONE<Santos> flinches at the rising bellow of smoke. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS639
01:40:58,00 --> 01:41:05,50
SOMEONE<Harris> squeezes his eye shut and SOMEONE<Imlay> gapes. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS640
01:41:07,00 --> 01:41:14,50
And SOMEONE<Imlay> leave their hiding spot and race across the street to join the others. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS641
01:41:24,00 --> 01:41:31,50
As an alien steps near, he fires. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS642
01:41:30,00 --> 01:41:35,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> checks his watch. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS643
01:41:41,00 --> 01:41:47,50
And SOMEONE<Santos> fire at the approaching craft. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS644
01:42:00,00 --> 01:42:05,50
Sergeant rises. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS645
01:42:14,00 --> 01:42:19,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> checks his watch again. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS646
01:42:32,00 --> 01:42:37,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> re-aims the laser. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS649
01:43:07,00 --> 01:43:14,50
SOMEONE's<Harris's> grin fades as the ground quakes. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS652
01:43:32,00 --> 01:43:39,50
As it lifts off, chunks of SOMEONE tumble off its enormous brain. SOMEONE<Nantz> adjusts. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS654
01:43:51,00 --> 01:43:57,50
SOMEONE<Doc> works to lift the panel off SOMEONE<Imlay>. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS655
01:44:22,00 --> 01:44:27,50
SOMEONE<Nantz> grabs the laser box. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS658
01:44:52,00 --> 01:44:56,50
He tosses her a magazine. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS659
01:45:07,00 --> 01:45:13,50
SOMEONE<Imlay> struggles to his knees. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS660
01:45:21,00 --> 01:45:26,50
SOMEONE lifts a grenade launcher 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS663
01:45:51,00 --> 01:45:56,50
Climbing up the concrete's slab, he spot the box 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS664
01:45:56,00 --> 01:46:02,50
SOMEONE fires at an alien which explodes and knocks 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS667
01:46:16,00 --> 01:46:21,50
SOMEONE<Santos> grabs the grenade launcher. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS668
01:46:24,00 --> 01:46:30,50
And center on the soaring missile hits the craft 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS669
01:46:30,00 --> 01:46:37,50
He falls onto his back and watches as fire builds inside the vessel. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS670
01:47:08,00 --> 01:47:16,50
Watches the drones, which spin out of control as they descend.  

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS671
01:47:20,00 --> 01:47:25,50
One hits the ground near the group. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS672
01:47:26,00 --> 01:47:31,50
He peers at the aliens. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS673
01:47:37,00 --> 01:47:42,50
SOMEONE lowers his empty rifle and draw his gun. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS675
01:47:47,00 --> 01:47:57,50
The aliens race away from the prevailing humans. And SOMEONE's<Nantz's> chest heaves as he watches them disappear around the corner. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS676
01:47:54,00 --> 01:48:08,50
He sweeps his gaze over the area, finding it unoccupied then lowers his gun. As drones continue to fall from the sky, columns of black smoke rise into the air from a flaming command center. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS677
01:48:08,00 --> 01:48:14,50
Sunlight shines 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS678
01:48:11,00 --> 01:48:19,50
Behind SOMEONE's<Nantz's> unit. Silhouetting them as they stand amidst the rubble and stare at the destroyed vessel. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS679
01:48:18,00 --> 01:48:26,50
Now SOMEONE<Nantz> and a handful of his comrades ride in the cabin of a helicopter. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS682
01:48:41,00 --> 01:48:46,50
He jumps down. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS683
01:48:47,00 --> 01:48:53,50
More Marines jog pass SOMEONE's<Nantz's> group. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS684
01:48:52,00 --> 01:48:57,50
A commanding Marine heads over to them. 

BATTLE_LOS_ANGELES_DVS685
01:49:18,00 --> 01:50:08,50
Now on a tent, SOMEONE<Imlay> chugs a bottle of water while SOMEONE<Doc> pours one over his head then drinks. With a tired look, SOMEONE<Santos> sips her own bottle. SOMEONE<Imlay> claps a hand on the back of SOMEONE's<Lockett's> neck then they share a look. Tears glisten in SOMEONE's<Nantz's> eyes as he shifts his gaze to Harris, who clasps his weapon to his chest and clenches his jaw. The staff sergeant eyes a supply of bullets and a stack of ammunition magazines sitting on a table. He grabs a bullet and loads it into an empty clip. As he fills the magazine, the others and his unit watch with disbelieving eyes. SOMEONE<Santos> shoots SOMEONE<Doc> a look. And the corpsman shifts his gaze to the staff sergeant. SOMEONE<Lockett> steps up to the table. As he gathers supplies, SOMEONE<Nantz> looks over and the corporal gives him a nod. SOMEONE<Doc> and SOMEONE<Imlay> join them.
