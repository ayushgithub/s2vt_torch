CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS14
00:03:01,00 --> 00:03:06,50
Sunset reception, they wear gold medals. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS15
00:03:06,00 --> 00:03:11,50
He place hands and smooth SOMEONE's hair. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS16
00:03:13,00 --> 00:03:18,50
They each affect a hunky stance. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS17
00:03:18,00 --> 00:03:26,50
The photographer steps away. SOMEONE<Sam> punches his brother's unflinching stomach. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS18
00:03:26,00 --> 00:03:32,50
A well groomed man gives SOMEONE<Tess> a warm hug. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS19
00:03:30,00 --> 00:03:35,50
SOMEONE grabs hors d'oeuvres from a passing waiter. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS20
00:03:50,00 --> 00:03:56,50
their rival's cold smile. SOMEONE<Charlie> grins and SOMEONE<Sam> smirks uneasily. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS21
00:04:01,00 --> 00:04:11,50
He holds his medal. Now, a row of cannons fires beside a sign - Baily Yacht Club. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS22
00:04:09,00 --> 00:04:13,50
From a deck, the two brothers watch heading out to sea. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS23
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:23,50
He rests his arm on SOMEONE's<Sam's> shoulders as they gaze out at the water. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS24
00:04:24,00 --> 00:04:31,50
SOMEONE<Sam> nods. SOMEONE<Charlie> pulls him into a hug and tousles his hair. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS25
00:04:31,00 --> 00:04:39,50
Now, in a car's passenger seat, a blonde uses a vanity mirror to apply lipstick. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS26
00:04:59,00 --> 00:05:05,50
SOMEONE<Sam> looks back and forth between his mother and brother. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS27
00:05:11,00 --> 00:05:18,50
Their mother gazes wistfully out her window. Now, the car rolls 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS28
00:05:20,00 --> 00:05:25,50
They watch parents enter a school. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS29
00:05:23,00 --> 00:05:28,50
She tugs at her cardigan. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS30
00:05:41,00 --> 00:05:45,50
He applauds.  

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS31
00:05:47,00 --> 00:05:56,50
At the podium, SOMEONE's sailing partner elbows her. Now, in a lobby, SOMEONE<Charlie> adjusts SOMEONE's<Sam's> tie. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS33
00:06:38,00 --> 00:06:50,50
Now, a lighthouse stands in the golden glow of a low sun. Water ripples in a marina. In town a few pedestrians laze along a sidewalk. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS34
00:06:50,00 --> 00:07:00,50
waits on the porch of a modest house with a baseball mitt. As SOMEONE<Sam> comes outside with his own mitt, his brother eyes his watch. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS35
00:07:20,00 --> 00:07:26,50
The younger brother pounds his glove. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS36
00:07:44,00 --> 00:07:49,50
runs down the driveway and up the street. SOMEONE<Charlie> steps out after him. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS37
00:07:48,00 --> 00:07:55,50
He beckons the boy. SOMEONE<Sam> takes a step closer and starts to throw. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS38
00:07:55,00 --> 00:08:02,50
The younger brother lumbers over. SOMEONE<Charlie> takes the ball. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS39
00:08:23,00 --> 00:08:28,50
As the boy obeys, their mother comes out in scrubs. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS40
00:08:36,00 --> 00:08:40,50
She runs after a bus. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS41
00:08:38,00 --> 00:08:46,50
Night time. SOMEONE<Sam> takes notes as he watches a baseball game on TV. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS42
00:08:43,00 --> 00:08:49,50
In the kitchen, SOMEONE<Charlie> cooks dinner. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS43
00:08:56,00 --> 00:09:12,50
He furiously scribbles notes. Now, outside, SOMEONE<Charlie> climbs out a window and pauses on a ledge. He hops down to the Splendid Splinter which sits with its sails lowered, then jumps down to the shadowy driveway.  

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS44
00:09:10,00 --> 00:09:23,50
Creeping alongside the house, he makes his way to the family car. He quietly opens the driver's side door and gets behind the wheel. As he starts the engine, the headlights reveal SOMEONE<Sam> standing in his path. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS45
00:09:23,00 --> 00:09:30,50
He wears a Red Sox jacket, his mitt,  and a giant foam finger. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS46
00:09:42,00 --> 00:09:49,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> glares, then begrudgingly beckons his younger brother. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS47
00:09:48,00 --> 00:09:51,50
He gets into the car beside him. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS48
00:09:56,00 --> 00:10:02,50
He buckles himself in. SOMEONE<Charlie> starts the car, then lightly backhands him. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS49
00:10:19,00 --> 00:10:24,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> whacks him playfully. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS50
00:10:53,00 --> 00:10:58,50
He smacks SOMEONE<Sam> again. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS51
00:11:03,00 --> 00:11:07,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> arches his brow. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS52
00:11:19,00 --> 00:11:26,50
SOMEONE<Sam> settles irritably into his seat. SOMEONE<Charlie> gets in one last punch. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS53
00:11:24,00 --> 00:11:31,50
The car slows to a stop as a steady stream of vehicles passes. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS54
00:11:32,00 --> 00:11:36,50
He turns the wheels to make a turn. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS55
00:11:42,00 --> 00:12:02,50
Cut to black. Now, shiny sparks glimmer in the darkness. As our view passes over them, they reveal themselves to be thousands of glass shards scattered on the inky asphalt. The station wagon lies on its crushed roof and an ambulance arrives down 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS56
00:12:01,00 --> 00:12:05,50
he is sitting between his brother's legs. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS57
00:12:09,00 --> 00:12:18,50
A paramedic's dark clad legs stride toward the car. He shines a flashlight. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS58
00:12:28,00 --> 00:12:32,50
while the paramedic shocks SOMEONE<Charlie> with defibrillator paddles. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS59
00:12:30,00 --> 00:12:34,50
He puts his hand on his neck. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS60
00:13:05,00 --> 00:13:10,50
He sees his brother beneath a sheet on another gurney. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS62
00:13:38,00 --> 00:13:43,50
Back at the scene of the accident, 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS63
00:13:41,00 --> 00:13:48,50
It shows wrecked station wagon. A flashlight sweeps over SOMEONE's<Sam's> baseball cap. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS64
00:14:02,00 --> 00:14:11,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> cradles SOMEONE's<Sam's> baseball glove against his chest as a white coffin lowers into an open grave. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS65
00:14:15,00 --> 00:14:21,50
He's swollen and eyes puffy. He stares of numbly. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS66
00:14:21,00 --> 00:14:27,50
He looks up and catches a glimpse of a red shape behind a headstone. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS67
00:14:32,00 --> 00:14:42,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> nervously shifts his gaze. He's pallid mother blinks down at the casket. SOMEONE<Charlie> backs away. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS68
00:14:40,00 --> 00:14:46,50
As he shuffles off, his mother grabs his arm. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS69
00:14:46,00 --> 00:14:58,50
Glancing at SOMEONE's<Sam's> grave over his shoulder, he pulls away, then breaks into a run. He abandons the funeral and sprints into the forest. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS70
00:14:55,00 --> 00:15:00,50
More headstones stand. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS71
00:14:58,00 --> 00:15:03,50
SOMEONE races pass them. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS72
00:15:01,00 --> 00:15:07,50
With his brother's baseball glove, he jogs down a trail. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS73
00:15:06,00 --> 00:15:11,50
As the setting sun flares through the trees around him ramming into the path. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS74
00:15:13,00 --> 00:15:17,50
He sees the scene of accident.  

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS75
00:15:26,00 --> 00:15:33,50
He starts to push himself up, then lowers his head toward the ground. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS76
00:15:33,00 --> 00:15:48,50
The grieving brother crawls onto his hands and knees, then weakly sits up. His chest heaves as he grimaces tearfully and hangs his head. The baseball rolls back out of the forest toward the mitt. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS77
00:15:46,00 --> 00:15:52,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> glances at it, then lifts his gaze. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS78
00:15:54,00 --> 00:16:06,50
His twisted features relax. SOMEONE<Sam> stands before him in his Red Sox jacket. SOMEONE<Charlie> gawks at his brother, then quizzically knits his brow. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS79
00:16:04,00 --> 00:16:09,50
SOMEONE<Sam> gives an irritable shrug. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS80
00:16:11,00 --> 00:16:17,50
His stunned older brother continues to stare at him. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS81
00:16:19,00 --> 00:16:28,50
SOMEONE<Sam> blinks. His lips pressed into a slight pout. SOMEONE<Charlie> earnestly lifts his dark brows. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS82
00:16:41,00 --> 00:16:56,50
SOMEONE's<Charlie's> gaping mouth curls into a faint smile. His brother gives a sharp nod. The ruddy leather mitt and white baseball lie on the mossy ground between them.  

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS83
00:16:54,00 --> 00:17:01,50
Our view rises into the trees above then soars into the sky.  

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS84
00:17:02,00 --> 00:17:09,50
The forest stretches across rolling hills between streaks of grayish orange clouds. The water catches their reflection in a flame colored. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS85
00:17:08,00 --> 00:17:13,50
Words appear - five years 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS86
00:17:19,00 --> 00:17:35,50
Now, dull gray clouds hang over the same view of the forest, the bay, and the sea. We glide toward the coastline and dive through the trees to the grassy cemetery. A white headstone reads Samuel St. Cloud. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS90
00:21:04,00 --> 00:21:11,50
She awkwardly hikes off. SOMEONE<Charlie> gazes after her. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS91
00:21:30,00 --> 00:21:37,50
A marine in dress uniform crouches at one of them. SOMEONE<Charlie> strides toward him. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS92
00:21:39,00 --> 00:21:46,50
The marine picks at something on the stone, then stands and grins. It's SOMEONE<Sully>. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS95
00:22:38,00 --> 00:22:46,50
SOMEONE<Sully> picks at bird poop on top of the stone, then studies it on the finger of his white glove. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS96
00:22:56,00 --> 00:23:25,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE<Alistair> carries a crossbow to a tree trunk stump with two arrows. Plopping the weapon on the ground, he quizzically eyes SOMEONE<Charlie> a short distance away. The caretaker stands alone among the headstones, gesturing conversationally and nodding as if talking to someone. SOMEONE<Alistair> keeps his gaze locked on his boss as he uses a pair of pliers to tug a crossbow bolt out of the tree. SOMEONE<Charlie> nods, seemingly to no one. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS98
00:23:35,00 --> 00:23:42,50
He beams and strolls off toward the forest. SOMEONE<Charlie> watches tearfully. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS99
00:23:41,00 --> 00:23:56,50
SOMEONE steps out of view behind the headstone which reads Timothy Patrick Sullivan, Lieutenant U. S. Marine Corp. Now, SOMEONE<Charlie> strolls into a hobby and toy shop. Three teen girls stand behind the counter. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS107
00:25:06,00 --> 00:25:15,50
His uniform work shirt. Wearing a long sleeve T, he tosses down his keys and slides open a drawer. He pulls out 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS108
00:25:16,00 --> 00:25:25,50
He pauses at the door to check the Quincy Harbor Sunset chart, then gives it a light tap and exits. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS109
00:25:24,00 --> 00:25:29,50
It shows he's moving the toy plane aside the gator. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS110
00:25:27,00 --> 00:25:31,50
Now the setting sun flares brightly through the forest. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS111
00:25:28,00 --> 00:25:36,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> hikes past a headstone showing a weeping angel trash bags slung over his shoulder while cradling his baseball glove to his chest. Smiling. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS112
00:25:35,00 --> 00:25:44,50
He walks in the sunny forest and enters the glade. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS113
00:25:42,00 --> 00:25:50,50
He slings down the trash bag, winds up and pitches in the air. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS114
00:25:49,00 --> 00:25:55,50
It smacks down into SOMEONE's<Sam's> mitt. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS115
00:25:55,00 --> 00:25:59,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> shows the plane. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS116
00:26:04,00 --> 00:26:09,50
big brother pounds his fist into his own mitt. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS117
00:26:15,00 --> 00:26:24,50
Later, the ball bounces along the ground and SOMEONE<Sam> catches it. He throws it back. SOMEONE<Charlie> sends him more grounders. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS118
00:26:43,00 --> 00:26:51,50
SOMEONE's<Sam's> jaw drops. SOMEONE<Charlie> throws the ball toward him, but he lets it bounce past. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS119
00:26:50,00 --> 00:26:57,50
SOMEONE<Sam> chuckles and shakes his head. SOMEONE<Charlie> remains solemn. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS120
00:26:55,00 --> 00:27:04,50
The younger brother swallows. His gaze drifting around the forest. Later, at an inlet. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS121
00:27:13,00 --> 00:27:18,50
The toy plane taxis on the water. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS122
00:27:27,00 --> 00:27:35,50
SOMEONE's<Sam's> smile falters and he grows thoughtful. His older brother glances skyward. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS123
00:27:42,00 --> 00:27:48,50
speeds into the sky. It circles, then flies into the 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS124
00:27:57,00 --> 00:28:02,50
light gives way to evening. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS125
00:28:01,00 --> 00:28:14,50
flips his hair out of his face. His merry grin fades as he surveys the darkened inlet. Finding himself alone, he idly runs his arms through the water. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS126
00:28:12,00 --> 00:28:19,50
Later, he climbs back onto shore. His long sleeved T molding itself to his life muscular 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS127
00:28:18,00 --> 00:28:43,50
grieving brother heaves a sigh and stares out at the inlet. Now, a light shines outside the boat shed and a window glows from within. Inside, SOMEONE<Charlie> sketches a sloop in red ink at a drafting table. He marks a star burst on the sail. Now, on another day, the glass door of a shop reflects an image of the street. Opening the door with his back, SOMEONE<Charlie> heads outside

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS128
00:28:46,00 --> 00:28:51,50
the pale man grabs SOMEONE's<Charlie's> shoulder. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS129
00:29:16,00 --> 00:29:22,50
Now, SOMEONE<Charlie> and Ferrente sit in a booth at a coffee shop. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS130
00:29:34,00 --> 00:29:41,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> notes a hospital bracelet on the wrist of his frail looking companion. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS131
00:30:18,00 --> 00:30:26,50
He lifts his palm skyward and opens them toward SOMEONE<Charlie>. The young man swallows. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS132
00:31:02,00 --> 00:31:10,50
Under Ferrente's stare, SOMEONE<Charlie> glances away, then shifts in his seat. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS133
00:31:08,00 --> 00:31:18,50
Now, he strides out of the restaurant, his eyes cast downward. As he steps into the street, a fisherman in waterproof bib pants 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS134
00:31:16,00 --> 00:31:24,50
slung over his shoulder. Heading toward the harbor, SOMEONE<Charlie> lifts his gaze and stops. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS135
00:31:25,00 --> 00:31:41,50
He stares mesmerized out at the water. A beautiful state of the art sloop glides across the harbor. SOMEONE<Charlie> looks away sucking in a breath, then returns his gaze to the sailboat as he sets his bag in the back of his gater. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS136
00:31:40,00 --> 00:31:48,50
He glances at his watch. At the dock, a television reporter films a news segment. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS137
00:31:49,00 --> 00:31:57,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> passes the news crew and strides down the SOMEONE<pier> with his eyes fixed on the boat. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS138
00:31:58,00 --> 00:32:12,50
Now, the vessel sits anchored with its foresail folded down and tied. The number 11 adorns the side of its sleek hull. SOMEONE<Charlie> squints at SOMEONE<Tess> as she commands a small crew. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS139
00:32:35,00 --> 00:32:43,50
In the glade, SOMEONE<Charlie> flips through a boating magazine to an article with photos of SOMEONE<Tess>. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS140
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:54,50
He grabs the magazine and runs off. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS141
00:32:57,00 --> 00:33:02,50
He reads the article. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS142
00:33:10,00 --> 00:33:37,50
He holds the open magazine against his leg and smooth's its wrinkled pages. Night time. At the cemetery, a light above the boat shed's open barn door illuminates the bow of SOMEONE's<Charlie's> neglected sailboat inside. In his work area, he sketches at a drafting table. The boating magazine rests above his paper open to pictures and diagrams of SOMEONE's<Tess's> canting keel. He leans back in his chair and glances around absentmindedly with his pencil.  

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS143
00:33:36,00 --> 00:33:53,50
Later, he rests his head on his hand, his brow furrowed. Lifting his gaze, he strokes his chin thoughtfully and stares at a calendar on the wall. Its monthly picture shows a whale's tail fin curved upward. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS144
00:33:53,00 --> 00:34:02,50
Now at the docks, our view glides from the blue and red hull of SOMEONE's sloop to SOMEONE sketching the sailboat. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS145
00:34:01,00 --> 00:34:07,50
SOMEONE<Alistair> approaches from behind. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS146
00:34:06,00 --> 00:34:14,50
He taps SOMEONE's<Charlie's> right shoulder, then leans over the left. SOMEONE<Charlie> flinches. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS147
00:35:18,00 --> 00:35:23,50
SOMEONE<Rachel> stares at him. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS148
00:35:49,00 --> 00:35:55,50
Elsewhere in the tavern, SOMEONE<Tink> joins SOMEONE<Tess> at a table. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS149
00:35:54,00 --> 00:35:58,50
He shows a weather map. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS151
00:36:30,00 --> 00:36:34,50
From the dining area, he points SOMEONE through a window. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS152
00:36:48,00 --> 00:36:53,50
He circles his finger by his temple. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS154
00:37:02,00 --> 00:37:06,50
Meanwhile clinching his jaw 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS155
00:37:08,00 --> 00:37:13,50
She meets his gaze. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS156
00:37:15,00 --> 00:37:20,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> looks over. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS157
00:37:35,00 --> 00:37:39,50
He grins at SOMEONE. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS158
00:37:53,00 --> 00:37:57,50
He punches him in the face. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS159
00:37:59,00 --> 00:38:13,50
SOMEONE<Alistair> watches him go. Outside, SOMEONE<Charlie> heads on to the dock with his bag. He glances over his shoulder at some people leaving the tavern, then pauses and examines his right hand. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS160
00:38:12,00 --> 00:38:22,50
As he pulls his jacket tight around himself, his gaze freezes and he stares wistfully out at the water. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS161
00:38:25,00 --> 00:38:32,50
A lamp at the dock's railing illuminates his lonesome figure. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS162
00:38:31,00 --> 00:38:55,50
Now, SOMEONE<Charlie> cautiously grabs a suspended safety wire running along the side of SOMEONE's<Tess's> sloop. He slides his hand across it as he walks the length of the deck. The vessel's lowered sails rest loosely around the boom, their folds draped over the cabin's roof. SOMEONE<Charlie> sweeps his gaze up at taut vertical line,

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS163
00:38:53,00 --> 00:39:04,50
then gives it a light karate chop. Grabbing onto it, he jumps up onto the edge of the deck. He leans back and tugs on the line. He remembers holding a line on his own boat. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS164
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:11,50
off the dock as he sees SOMEONE in the cockpit. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS165
00:39:11,00 --> 00:39:16,50
He starts to leave. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS166
00:39:16,00 --> 00:39:23,50
She smirks at him as she pulls the crank off a winch. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS167
00:39:40,00 --> 00:39:46,50
climbs up onto her deck and looks down at SOMEONE<Charlie>. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS168
00:40:23,00 --> 00:40:33,50
He averts his gaze and stares off. Shifting her eyes, SOMEONE<Tess> sucks in a breath, then glances at her shoes. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS169
00:40:40,00 --> 00:40:56,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> watches as she jumps into the sunken cockpit and grabs the lip of the cabin's roof. She shoots him a look, then swings into the boat. SOMEONE<Charlie> glances away, then buries his face in his hands. Lifting his gaze again, he swallows hard. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS170
00:40:55,00 --> 00:41:00,50
SOMEONE<Tess> peers out from the cabin. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS171
00:41:03,00 --> 00:41:12,50
As she emerges, SOMEONE<Charlie> takes his drawing pad out of his bag. SOMEONE<Tess> looks down on him from her deck. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS172
00:41:11,00 --> 00:41:16,50
He shows her his keel sketch. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS173
00:41:42,00 --> 00:41:52,50
He averts his gaze. Crouching beside him, SOMEONE<Tess> takes the pad. She flips to his drawing of her sloop. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS174
00:41:53,00 --> 00:41:59,50
SOMEONE<Tess> eyes him, her face inches from his. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS175
00:42:01,00 --> 00:42:06,50
He steps away. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS176
00:42:06,00 --> 00:42:12,50
She looks off, then glances at SOMEONE<Charlie> as he leaves. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS177
00:42:11,00 --> 00:42:19,50
Pale sunlight glows on the horizon and shadows hang over the boats at the marina. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS178
00:42:17,00 --> 00:42:25,50
An aerial view shows sunbeams leaking through evergreens behind the Quincy lighthouse. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS179
00:42:23,00 --> 00:42:31,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> stares out at the inlet where SOMEONE's<Tess's> sloop glides toward the open sea. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS181
00:42:34,00 --> 00:42:38,50
the boat which tilts slightly 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS182
00:42:36,00 --> 00:42:41,50
billowing sails. A name on its stern 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS183
00:42:40,00 --> 00:42:45,50
SOMEONE<Tess> uses her radio. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS184
00:42:58,00 --> 00:43:04,50
She puts down the mic, then eyes her sails. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS185
00:43:07,00 --> 00:43:12,50
She pushes the tiller, then pulls on a rope. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS189
00:43:47,00 --> 00:43:52,50
Now, in the glade, SOMEONE<Charlie>, on a baseball, He tosses the ball to SOMEONE<Sam>. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS190
00:43:52,00 --> 00:43:57,50
SOMEONE<Sam> throws back to SOMEONE<Charlie>. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS191
00:44:02,00 --> 00:44:07,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> fakes a hard throw. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS192
00:44:07,00 --> 00:44:11,50
SOMEONE<Sam> mocks him. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS193
00:44:30,00 --> 00:44:34,50
He throws the ball fast 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS194
00:44:46,00 --> 00:44:57,50
He holds his glove chest high. As SOMEONE<Sam> winds up, SOMEONE<Charlie> closes his eyes. SOMEONE<Sam> pitches the ball into SOMEONE's<Charlie's> crotch. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS195
00:45:10,00 --> 00:45:18,50
As rain pours down on the brothers, a smile spreads across SOMEONE's<Charlie's> face. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS196
00:46:15,00 --> 00:46:27,50
SOMEONE<Sam> dives onto his lid, but goes nowhere. In the cemetery, darkness falls over the statue of a young girl, then the rain ceases as day breaks. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS197
00:46:26,00 --> 00:46:34,50
Some geese peck at the grass while SOMEONE<Charlie> peeks out at them from behind a headstone. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS198
00:46:40,00 --> 00:46:46,50
He rushes at them, banging his trash can lids together. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS199
00:46:47,00 --> 00:46:52,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> spots her. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS200
00:46:50,00 --> 00:46:55,50
Colorful flowers line the hedge around the graves. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS201
00:47:02,00 --> 00:47:06,50
She stands and winces. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS202
00:47:05,00 --> 00:47:09,50
He jogs back to her. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS203
00:47:12,00 --> 00:47:17,50
He indicates a wound on her head. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS204
00:47:26,00 --> 00:47:32,50
Later, SOMEONE<Charlie> applies antiseptic to her wound. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS205
00:47:34,00 --> 00:47:40,50
He lowers her hair back over the cut. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS206
00:47:45,00 --> 00:47:58,50
the kitchen. SOMEONE<Tess> drums on the edge of her chair, then stands and crosses to a window. She notices a framed photo of SOMEONE<Charlie> and SOMEONE<Sam> on the Splendid Splinter and picks it up. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS207
00:48:06,00 --> 00:48:12,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> blinks, his gaze stricken. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS208
00:48:32,00 --> 00:48:52,50
She leaves the cabin with a coy smirk. Turning, SOMEONE<Charlie> plants his hands on the kitchen door frame and leans far back. He straightens, checks his watch, and checks the sunset chart. Pounding it with his fist, he pulls a curtain aside and watches SOMEONE<Tess> walk away through a warped glass window. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS209
00:48:52,00 --> 00:49:01,50
He rushes from the cabin to a waterside ridge. Jumping down to the gravel shore, he races after SOMEONE<Tess>. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS210
00:49:01,00 --> 00:49:08,50
He halts in his tracks, gazing helplessly after the departing girl. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS211
00:49:08,00 --> 00:49:14,50
She slows as he runs to catch up to her. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS212
00:49:28,00 --> 00:49:34,50
Walking away, SOMEONE<Tess> bites her lip. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS213
00:49:39,00 --> 00:49:44,50
She turns back with a warm smirk. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS214
00:49:58,00 --> 00:50:07,50
SOMEONE<Sam> throws to his brother. SOMEONE<Charlie> catches the ball, tosses it from his mitt to his hand, then returns it. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS215
00:50:20,00 --> 00:50:26,50
The young boy lowers his doleful gaze. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS216
00:50:27,00 --> 00:50:37,50
SOMEONE<Sam> gives a nod and readies himself for a catch. SOMEONE<Charlie> pounds the ball into his glove, then throws it to him. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS217
00:50:41,00 --> 00:50:45,50
At dinner, 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS218
00:51:13,00 --> 00:51:27,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> goes into the kitchen. Clad in a white halter dress, SOMEONE<Tess> crosses to a bulletin board covered in sketches of boat designs. She turns abruptly as SOMEONE<Charlie> returns with a glass of white wine for her. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS219
00:51:26,00 --> 00:51:34,50
She takes it and points. Stacked boxes fill a corner of the room. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS220
00:51:36,00 --> 00:51:43,50
SOMEONE<Tess> lowers her gaze. Pointing, SOMEONE<Charlie> crosses to a high box. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS221
00:52:05,00 --> 00:52:15,50
His gaze distant, the young man sips his wine. SOMEONE<Tess> points over her shoulder where SOMEONE's<Charlie's> sketch of her sloop hangs on the wall. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS222
00:52:14,00 --> 00:52:19,50
He looks from the drawing to his date. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS223
00:52:18,00 --> 00:52:33,50
She leans back coyly against his drafting table and sips her wine. He steps in close, reaches past her shoulder and takes the sketch down. With a smoldering look, he offers it to her. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS224
00:52:31,00 --> 00:52:37,50
She takes it with a coquettish smirk. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS225
00:52:36,00 --> 00:52:41,50
As he leans in closer, she brushes past him. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS226
00:52:47,00 --> 00:52:52,50
She faces a map. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS227
00:52:57,00 --> 00:53:01,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> steps in behind her. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS228
00:53:01,00 --> 00:53:06,50
He plants a tender kiss on her shoulder. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS229
00:53:07,00 --> 00:53:17,50
He turns her to face him and his lips hungrily finds hers. She briefly melts into the kiss, then stops him gently. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS230
00:53:50,00 --> 00:53:56,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> reluctantly backs off and she heads for the door. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS231
00:53:58,00 --> 00:54:05,50
He plants his hands on the dining table and bends over, leaning his hips back. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS232
00:54:04,00 --> 00:54:18,50
He turns, then crosses to the door and opens it. Finding no one there, he hurries back to the table. He grabs a jar containing a burning candle, then ventures out into the darkness. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS233
00:54:17,00 --> 00:54:23,50
He shuts the door behind him and looks around. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS234
00:54:28,00 --> 00:54:33,50
He proceeds against pale mist. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS235
00:54:33,00 --> 00:54:38,50
He turns around. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS236
00:54:38,00 --> 00:54:42,50
as tall stone monuments, searching spot and catches a glimpse of SOMEONE<Tess> proceeds in her direction. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS237
00:54:42,00 --> 00:54:46,50
He continues searching. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS238
00:54:52,00 --> 00:54:57,50
He turns, she plants a passionate kiss on his lips. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS239
00:54:57,00 --> 00:55:03,50
He pulls her close as they tenderly canoodle. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS240
00:55:02,00 --> 00:55:06,50
They kiss. But SOMEONE<Tess> pulls back. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS241
00:55:06,00 --> 00:55:11,50
She blows out the candle and runs off. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS243
00:55:20,00 --> 00:55:25,50
to a stop, with the angel monument silhouetted behind the head. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS244
00:55:24,00 --> 00:55:31,50
SOMEONE<Tess> waits for him in a clearing between grave plots.  

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS245
00:55:36,00 --> 00:55:40,50
She lays her hands on his chest. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS246
00:55:45,00 --> 00:55:50,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> slowly rolls his shoulders back. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS247
00:56:22,00 --> 00:56:28,50
Moving as one, they turn on the spot. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS248
00:56:32,00 --> 00:56:38,50
sharing a tender gaze.  

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS249
00:56:37,00 --> 00:56:44,50
SOMEONE<Tess> trails her fingers scars on SOMEONE's<Charlie's> upper chest and gives a gentle smile. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS250
00:56:47,00 --> 00:56:54,50
SOMEONE's<Charlie's> expression darkens and he turns his gaze skyward. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS251
00:57:03,00 --> 00:57:12,50
Smiling, she gives him a gentle peck on the lips. SOMEONE<Charlie> pulls her into a long kiss. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS252
00:57:12,00 --> 00:57:17,50
SOMEONE<Tess> lays her head on his shoulder. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS253
00:57:18,00 --> 00:57:22,50
deeper into the embrace. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS254
00:57:22,00 --> 00:57:33,50
The next morning, SOMEONE<Charlie> sleeps naked amid the grave monuments. His head rolls toward us and his eyes blink open groggily. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS255
00:57:32,00 --> 00:57:40,50
He smacks his dry lips. A lone goose stares back at him. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS256
00:57:38,00 --> 00:58:08,50
Now, in jeans and a T-shirt, SOMEONE<Charlie> hikes up the waterside path leading to the caretaker's grounds. He breaks into a brief jog, rubbing his eyes. Reaching the cabin, he finds a slip of paper tacked to the door bearing a doodle of the Splendid Splinter. A handwritten note on the back reads come find me. Turning the slip over, SOMEONE<Charlie> reads the message and smiles. He jogs toward the boat shed which sits with its barn doors closed. Turning to the bay, he finds SOMEONE<Tess> manning his old skiff. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS257
00:58:07,00 --> 00:58:16,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> glances away pensively. Clad in his buttoned down shirt, SOMEONE<Tess> smiles at him. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS258
00:58:14,00 --> 00:58:19,50
In the boat, SOMEONE trails his fingers in the water as the Splendid 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS261
00:59:04,00 --> 00:59:13,50
Now, in the golden glow of a low sun, SOMEONE<Tess> and SOMEONE<Charlie> cuddle at the top of a lighthouse. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS262
00:59:29,00 --> 00:59:36,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> nods. SOMEONE<Tess> faces the water with a smile. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS263
01:00:26,00 --> 01:00:33,50
She eyes him quizzically, her smile gradually fading. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS264
01:00:39,00 --> 01:00:46,50
He leaves SOMEONE alone at the lighthouse. Now, SOMEONE<Charlie> sprints frantically through the woods following the winding footpath. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS265
01:00:44,00 --> 01:00:48,50
Now, SOMEONE<Charlie> sprints frantically through the woods following the winding footpath. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS266
01:00:47,00 --> 01:00:51,50
He reaches the glade. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS267
01:00:50,00 --> 01:00:55,50
He finds his brother trudging away. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS268
01:00:55,00 --> 01:01:01,50
He halts at the edge of the woods and turns back. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS269
01:01:35,00 --> 01:01:41,50
Turning, SOMEONE<Charlie> finds SOMEONE<Tess> behind him. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS270
01:01:40,00 --> 01:01:45,50
He looks back in SOMEONE's<Sam's> direction. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS271
01:01:45,00 --> 01:01:53,50
He finds his brother gone. SOMEONE<Charlie> faces SOMEONE<Tess>. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS272
01:02:00,00 --> 01:02:05,50
SOMEONE<Tess> takes his hand and kisses it. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS273
01:02:30,00 --> 01:02:43,50
He shakes his head, then yanks his hand from her grasp. SOMEONE<Tess> blinks tearfully as she watches him turn away. With a resolute expression, he steps further into the glade. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS274
01:02:53,00 --> 01:03:01,50
He shuts his eyes. As SOMEONE<Tess> leaves, he opens them again in a haunted stare. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS275
01:03:01,00 --> 01:03:16,50
We peer back at him from the edge of the woods as he stands motionless, his gaze fixed in our direction. Night time. In the caretaker's cabin, SOMEONE<Charlie> sits alone and bleary eyed with a glass of whiskey

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS276
01:03:34,00 --> 01:03:50,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> morosely sips his liquor. The next morning, boats languidly sail past the coastal town. In a house overlooking a bay, a golden retriever gnaws on a chew toy in the living room.  

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS277
01:03:49,00 --> 01:03:53,50
SOMEONE<Tess> pulls on a denim jacket. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS278
01:03:53,00 --> 01:03:57,50
SOMEONE eyes the dog, grabs a leash from a hook by the door. Dog runs out a doggie door. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS279
01:03:57,00 --> 01:04:01,50
SOMEONE leaves the house. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS280
01:04:03,00 --> 01:04:12,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Charlie> lies asleep on his couch. He licks his lips, then groggily lifts his head. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS281
01:04:16,00 --> 01:04:20,50
He rises. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS282
01:04:28,00 --> 01:04:34,50
He sets a coffee pot in the kitchen sink. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS283
01:04:32,00 --> 01:04:42,50
As water fills the carafe, he opens a freezer and takes out a rumpled bag of grounds. He scowls at it, then gives it a shake. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS284
01:04:40,00 --> 01:04:45,50
He crumples it. Tosses it 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS285
01:04:42,00 --> 01:04:47,50
his shoulder and shuts off the tap. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS286
01:04:47,00 --> 01:04:54,50
Now, at a diner counter, SOMEONE<Charlie> sips coffee. SOMEONE<Alistair> joins him. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS287
01:04:53,00 --> 01:04:58,50
Wearing green sweater, he browses a newspaper. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS288
01:05:07,00 --> 01:05:12,50
Two officers step to a prominent spot in the dinning room. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS289
01:05:11,00 --> 01:05:16,50
Outside, she runs. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS290
01:05:16,00 --> 01:05:21,50
SOMEONE<Julie> lets the dog run by. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS291
01:05:21,00 --> 01:05:32,50
SOMEONE's<Tess's> smile fades as her friend walks past her with no acknowledgement. SOMEONE<Tess> faces a shop window. Back in the diner 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS292
01:05:39,00 --> 01:05:43,50
SOMEONE<Tess> frowns at the window. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS293
01:05:45,00 --> 01:05:49,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> pictures the Carniceria and the brewing squall. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS294
01:05:47,00 --> 01:05:55,50
A view from his cottage shows SOMEONE<Tess> vanish as she walks away. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS295
01:06:01,00 --> 01:06:05,50
SOMEONE passes by, 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS296
01:06:14,00 --> 01:06:19,50
The Splendid Splinter remains stored inside. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS297
01:06:18,00 --> 01:06:24,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> stares at the neglected boat. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS298
01:06:22,00 --> 01:06:48,50
Now, in the cemetery, tombstones stand in light and shadow. A distant sprinkler waters the grass. SOMEONE<Charlie> glowers as he strides among the graves. Farther along, our view peers over the headstone in memory of SOMEONE's<Tess's> father. SOMEONE<Charlie> steps into view and crouches down on one knee. The engraved side remains hidden to us, but visible to him. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS299
01:07:04,00 --> 01:07:17,50
SOMEONE<Tess> leans huddled against her father's headstone. SOMEONE's<Charlie's> tearful gaze stays on her as she returns a grief stricken look. Her head wound bleeds. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS300
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:55,50
SOMEONE's<Charlie's> eyes pool with tears. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS301
01:08:10,00 --> 01:08:21,50
His jaw falls slack. He sheds a heavy tear, then blinks his stunned red eyes. He's alone in the hedge lined plot. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS302
01:08:21,00 --> 01:08:30,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> bows his head restlessly, then looks up, his face locked in a stiff SOMEONE<grimace>. In the 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS303
01:08:28,00 --> 01:08:32,50
He throws papers and books off his desk 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS304
01:08:39,00 --> 01:08:43,50
hunches the sunset charts on the wall 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS305
01:08:42,00 --> 01:08:53,50
down onto a table. SOMEONE<Charlie> doubles over the charts, agonizing. He grips the table and presses his forehead to the fallen charts. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS306
01:08:57,00 --> 01:09:08,50
He straightens a little, his eyes on the charts. Clad in a deep blue shirt, his strong back flexes as he catches his breath. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS307
01:09:07,00 --> 01:09:13,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> opens a bureau drawer. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS308
01:09:11,00 --> 01:09:24,50
Reaching inside, he strokes his baseball mitt, then firmly lays it flat. He leans over the open drawer, his eyes un-waveringly on its contents. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS309
01:09:23,00 --> 01:09:32,50
Our view of SOMEONE<Charlie> seen from the shoulders up straightens with him and he leaves the cottage. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS310
01:09:35,00 --> 01:09:42,50
Now, SOMEONE<Charlie> sits in the woods, his gaze distant. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS311
01:09:45,00 --> 01:09:53,50
SOMEONE<Sam> looks on. His red mitt dangles on his hand at his side. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS312
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:09,50
SOMEONE<Sam> takes a few steps closer and lets his mitt drop to the ground. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS313
01:10:06,00 --> 01:10:12,50
He takes a seat by his big brother. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS314
01:10:14,00 --> 01:10:23,50
SOMEONE<Sam> peers sidelong at his brother who stares off. SOMEONE<Sam> rests a hand on SOMEONE's<Charlie's> leg. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS315
01:10:26,00 --> 01:10:31,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> sits frozen in a troubled daze. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS317
01:10:33,00 --> 01:10:40,50
Now, at night, his cottage door opens and he turns on the lights. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS318
01:10:40,00 --> 01:10:48,50
Later, in the ransacked room, he positions a milk crate on the messy floor and 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS319
01:10:45,00 --> 01:10:51,50
some papers into it in a feeble start to cleaning up. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS320
01:10:51,00 --> 01:10:58,50
Outside, a woman in a dark knee length dress treads toward the cottage door. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS321
01:11:19,00 --> 01:11:26,50
The fair skinned brunette woman reaches out offering the necklace. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS322
01:11:29,00 --> 01:11:35,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> reaches out and accepts. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS323
01:11:41,00 --> 01:11:47,50
As the widow turns away, SOMEONE<Charlie> fingers the medallion. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS324
01:12:01,00 --> 01:12:22,50
Mrs. SOMEONE<Ferrente> smiles sadly as she leaves alone and SOMEONE<Charlie> regards the silver quatrefoil pendant. His gaze focuses beyond the medallion to the floor where SOMEONE's<Tess's> note in red ink shows among the cluttered papers. The doodle of the sailboat lies face up. SOMEONE<Charlie> fetches the note. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS325
01:12:25,00 --> 01:12:36,50
He meditatively takes a seat and turns the scrap over reading the three word message in SOMEONE's<Tess's> cute handwriting - come find me. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS326
01:12:48,00 --> 01:12:53,50
Now, at SOMEONE's<Maddie's>. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS327
01:13:23,00 --> 01:13:27,50
SOMEONE backs SOMEONE away 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS328
01:13:26,00 --> 01:13:34,50
SOMEONE<Alistair> watches SOMEONE<Tink> enter the convenience type store to finish his transaction, then he faces SOMEONE<Charlie>. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS329
01:15:00,00 --> 01:15:03,50
The cruise get closer. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS330
01:15:07,00 --> 01:15:11,50
Now, in the full featuring a half dozen rocky humps.  

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS331
01:15:25,00 --> 01:15:30,50
Now, it shows the reflection of sun on the sea. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS332
01:15:39,00 --> 01:15:43,50
SOMEONE<Tony> groggily to his feet. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS333
01:15:56,00 --> 01:16:01,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> reluctantly stands.  

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS334
01:16:14,00 --> 01:16:21,50
Outside guy leaving only patches of powder blue. SOMEONE checks his watch. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS336
01:16:28,00 --> 01:16:32,50
SOMEONE glances at his friend. His bold gaze drift. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS337
01:16:32,00 --> 01:16:36,50
His friend lies down. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS338
01:16:36,00 --> 01:16:42,50
SOMEONE<Alistair> keeps his eyes shut and arms crossed. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS339
01:16:49,00 --> 01:16:53,50
SOMEONE<Charlie> stares off tearful. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS340
01:16:52,00 --> 01:16:56,50
gently ruffled by the wind. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS341
01:16:56,00 --> 01:17:02,50
He holds up the St. Jude medallion and gazes at its polished necklace. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS342
01:17:01,00 --> 01:17:05,50
It glints in the brilliant. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS343
01:17:15,00 --> 01:17:20,50
the necklace with a knit brow, then squeezes. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS344
01:17:18,00 --> 01:17:23,50
his fist and turns his resolute glare toward the water. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS345
01:17:29,00 --> 01:17:34,50
leaving a wide wake. The setting sun color 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS346
01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:58,50
In Quincy, the dock lights turn on and the sunset cannon fires. In the cemetery, shadows stretch over the grass. An old headstone shaped like a Celtic cross towers over the other grave markers. Five geese wander past. In the glade, golden beams of light shine on SOMEONE<Sam>. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS347
01:18:05,00 --> 01:18:08,50
The boy is waiting. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS348
01:18:07,00 --> 01:18:14,50
The boy stares expectantly at the other end of the clearing, then shakes his hair out of his eyes. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS349
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:16,50
He gives a slight wince. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS350
01:18:16,00 --> 01:18:27,50
His lips pout into a frown. On the boat, golden light bathes SOMEONE's<Charlie's> solemn face. In the glade, SOMEONE<Sam> drops his gaze. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS351
01:18:25,00 --> 01:18:38,50
He puts his baseball cap on, then wipes his nose on the back of his hand. Gazing skyward, he adjusts the hat lower on his forehead. Meanwhile, tears well up and glisten 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS352
01:18:40,00 --> 01:19:01,50
Several teardrops plummet down his cheeks. In the glade, SOMEONE<Sam> sadly bows his head. Mustering a brave expression, he punches a fist into his mitt. He glances at the sky, then hikes off into the forest and looks back over his shoulder at waning golden light filling the glade. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS353
01:19:13,00 --> 01:19:19,50
A smile breaks across his boyish face. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS354
01:19:24,00 --> 01:19:28,50
Big brother playfully swats his cheek. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS355
01:19:28,00 --> 01:19:43,50
Back in the forest, the setting sun brightens and SOMEONE's<Sam's> grinning form vanishes. Back at sea, gray clouds darken the orange tinted sky. SOMEONE<Charlie> looks up and finds a shooting across it. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS356
01:19:42,00 --> 01:19:46,50
His lips part. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS357
01:19:44,00 --> 01:19:50,50
As the sun sinks below the horizon, the shooting star falls to the horizon. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS359
01:19:54,00 --> 01:19:59,50
He returns toward the cabin and bangs on the windshield in front of SOMEONE. 

CHARLIE_ST_CLOUD_DVS360
01:20:17,00 --> 01:20:21,50
closer. The search on a flashlight.
