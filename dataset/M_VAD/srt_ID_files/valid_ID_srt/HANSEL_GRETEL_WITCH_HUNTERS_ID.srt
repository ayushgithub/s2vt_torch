HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS34
00:02:51,00 --> 00:02:59,50
They pause at the edge of the clearing where they behold an amazing house made of candy and pastries. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS36
00:03:06,00 --> 00:03:14,50
The children cautiously walk through the compound up to the house, looking around as they go. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS37
00:03:12,00 --> 00:03:18,50
They stop and exchange a glance before they charge to the door and pound on it. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS39
00:03:30,00 --> 00:03:35,50
the boy breaks off a piece of the house and starts to eat it. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS40
00:03:33,00 --> 00:03:39,50
The girl picks off a piece near her and tastes it as well. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS42
00:03:38,00 --> 00:03:43,50
As the siblings chew, the door to the cottage creaks open. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS43
00:03:46,00 --> 00:03:53,50
With an unnerved look at each other, the duo enters the house hesitantly 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS44
00:03:51,00 --> 00:03:56,50
and the door slowly closes behind them. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS45
00:04:07,00 --> 00:04:13,50
Inside, flames light on candles around the room. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS46
00:04:15,00 --> 00:04:23,50
The kids grab hold of one another as they suddenly see the twisted silhouette of a figure watching them. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS47
00:04:23,00 --> 00:04:31,50
The siblings clutch each other in fright as a disfigured witch with rotted teeth walks into the light, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS48
00:04:28,00 --> 00:04:33,50
eyeing them with an evil smirk. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS49
00:04:36,00 --> 00:04:43,50
Later, the young boy is imprisoned in a cage while his shackled sister looks on. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS50
00:04:41,00 --> 00:04:45,50
The witch strikes her and she falls. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS51
00:04:46,00 --> 00:04:52,50
The witch attempts to force feed the boy. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS52
00:04:52,00 --> 00:05:00,50
The girl pulls out a loose nail and pockets it as the witch grabs her and holds a knife to her throat. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS54
00:05:02,00 --> 00:05:06,50
Her brother reluctantly eats. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS55
00:05:06,00 --> 00:05:11,50
A fire blazes in an oven. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS56
00:05:14,00 --> 00:05:22,50
The witch slams her knife into a stool and moves to the cage, grabbing the boy. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS57
00:05:20,00 --> 00:05:28,50
As she and the boy struggle, the girl picks the lock on her chain with the nail until it pops open. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS58
00:05:25,00 --> 00:05:30,50
The witch then opens the oven door. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS59
00:05:32,00 --> 00:05:37,50
The girl runs to the stool and picks up the knife. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS60
00:05:35,00 --> 00:05:42,50
The witch slowly turns around to her and fires a bolt from her wand. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS61
00:05:41,00 --> 00:05:46,50
It shoots right through the girl doing no harm. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS62
00:05:48,00 --> 00:05:53,50
The girl stabs her repeatedly with the knife. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS63
00:05:51,00 --> 00:05:56,50
As the hut collapses, the girl frees her brother. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS64
00:05:54,00 --> 00:06:01,50
Behind them, the witch slowly gets to her feet spitting blood. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS66
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:06,50
The boy strikes the witch with the log causing her to fall back into the oven. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS68
00:06:05,00 --> 00:06:11,50
The siblings yank on a chain that closes the furnace as they watch her burn. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS69
00:06:33,00 --> 00:06:38,50
Over a gust of flames, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS73
00:06:44,00 --> 00:06:49,50
witch defeated by orphaned siblings. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS74

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS112
00:08:37,00 --> 00:08:44,50
The numerous dark outlines of trees have missing children posters attached to them. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS113
00:08:42,00 --> 00:08:48,50
From out of nowhere, an arrow pins a sheet of paper to a tree. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS115
00:08:49,00 --> 00:08:54,50
The poster is consumed by flames.

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS118
00:09:51,00 --> 00:09:57,50
He immerses the captive woman's head in a barrel of water. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS119
00:10:03,00 --> 00:10:10,50
The woman struggles with her captors as a man in his 50s approaches. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS120
00:10:10,00 --> 00:10:14,50
He turns to the crowd. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS121
00:10:47,00 --> 00:10:53,50
A gun appears at pointblank range near SOMEONE's<Berringer's> head. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS122
00:12:12,00 --> 00:12:19,50
They disperse as SOMEONE<Hansel> turns to Mina, a young woman with light hair.

00:13:11,00 --> 00:13:15,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> lowers his gun. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS126
00:13:14,00 --> 00:13:20,50
On the ground, SOMEONE<Berringer> grasps his bloody nose.

00:13:35,00 --> 00:13:44,50
Gretel, a young woman with dark hair and an athletic build, kicks down the door of an isolated cottage in the woods. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS128
00:13:42,00 --> 00:13:51,50
She points her crossbow at a witch with scaly skin and black hair who turns and raises her hands to her head. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS129
00:13:49,00 --> 00:13:57,50

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS130
00:13:54,00 --> 00:14:03,50
The witch dodges the bolts, grabs her broom and flies through a window, breaking some wooden panes as she bursts through. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS131
00:14:01,00 --> 00:14:05,50
As she soars through the forest,

00:14:03,00 --> 00:14:08,50
she is shot and is sent crashing to the ground.

00:14:08,00 --> 00:14:15,50

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS135
00:14:13,00 --> 00:14:20,50
As the witch scurries away, he shoots then runs after her in pursuit. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS136
00:14:18,00 --> 00:14:25,50
The witch grabs her wand and fires at him, but the dark energy bounces off him. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS137
00:14:25,00 --> 00:14:32,50
She then casts a spell and barrier of tall, thin trees raises in front of him. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS138
00:14:31,00 --> 00:14:37,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> weakens the barrier by shooting at it and then runs through. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS139
00:14:35,00 --> 00:14:40,50
Nearby, SOMEONE<Gretel> listens to the sounds of battle. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS140
00:14:42,00 --> 00:14:51,50
The witch continues on her flight, a demon-like quality giving her speed and agility through the obstacles of the forest 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS141
00:14:48,00 --> 00:14:53,50
as SOMEONE<Hansel> pursues closely behind. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS142
00:14:54,00 --> 00:15:01,50
As the witch pulls ahead, SOMEONE<Gretel> flies out of the underbrush and tackles her to the ground. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS143
00:15:02,00 --> 00:15:09,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> catches up with the witch and the two of them exchange blows. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS144
00:15:08,00 --> 00:15:12,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> strikes the witch. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS145
00:15:10,00 --> 00:15:16,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> is blinded as the hag throws dirt in his eyes. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS146
00:15:15,00 --> 00:15:21,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> catches the witch and slams her body into the ground. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS147
00:15:19,00 --> 00:15:24,50
The witch gets up and turns to flee. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS149
00:15:24,00 --> 00:15:29,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> somersaults, grabs her crossbow and shoots the witch in the ankle. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS150
00:15:30,00 --> 00:15:37,50
She heaves the weapon over a branch and pulls on a string attached to the arrow 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS151
00:15:34,00 --> 00:15:40,50
Dragging the witch until she hangs suspended in the air by her foot. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS153
00:15:39,00 --> 00:15:44,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> snatches the witches wand away from her. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS154
00:15:43,00 --> 00:15:49,50
The witch flails in mid-air as the siblings watch. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS155
00:15:55,00 --> 00:15:59,50
He strikes her with his gun. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS156
00:16:05,00 --> 00:16:10,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> unrolls a scroll. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS157
00:16:33,00 --> 00:16:38,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> checks his wrist-timer. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS158
00:16:50,00 --> 00:16:55,50
He injects a substance into his thigh. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS159
00:17:25,00 --> 00:17:30,50
Later, a man fills a water bowl for two dogs. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS160
00:17:27,00 --> 00:17:33,50
Inside, He throws the boot on the table. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS161
00:17:38,00 --> 00:17:43,50
The Sheriff sits facing a few burly men. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS162
00:18:02,00 --> 00:18:07,50
SOMEONE<Berringer> throws a pouch down in front of the men. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS163
00:18:07,00 --> 00:18:12,50
Coins spill out catching the mercenaries attention. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS164
00:18:11,00 --> 00:18:18,50
Outside, a large man with long, blonde hair takes the dogs and leads the men out of town. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS165
00:18:23,00 --> 00:18:29,50
SOMEONE<Berringer> watches then saunters off smoking a pipe. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS166
00:18:38,00 --> 00:18:45,50
Deep in the dark forest, an unbroken swathe of trees stretches to the horizon. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS167
00:18:43,00 --> 00:18:48,50
A fire is lit in a small clearing. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS168
00:18:46,00 --> 00:18:54,50
The light casts eerily shadows into the gloom as the nervous trackers huddle around the meager flames. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS169
00:19:00,00 --> 00:19:06,50
One of the men picks up a bone and casts it to the dogs. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS170
00:19:06,00 --> 00:19:12,50
The men turn to the ignored bone and notice that the dogs are missing. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS171
00:19:10,00 --> 00:19:16,50
They look up to see a beautiful woman with long, dark hair 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS172
00:19:13,00 --> 00:19:19,50
standing at the edge of the firelight, flanked by the two dogs. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS173
00:19:17,00 --> 00:19:22,50
The slowly get up and approach the stranger. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS175
00:20:05,00 --> 00:20:11,50
The woman morphs into a with and the dogs attack their owner. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS176
00:20:11,00 --> 00:20:15,50
They scatter. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS177
00:20:15,00 --> 00:20:23,50
She casts a spell causing vines to ensnare and suspend a tracker in midair, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS178
00:20:20,00 --> 00:20:26,50
Stretching his limbs out in all four directions. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS179
00:20:26,00 --> 00:20:34,50
With a sweep of her wand, the man's limbs are torn from his core and drop to the ground with a thud. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS180
00:20:32,00 --> 00:20:38,50
The witch then intercepts the remaining hunter. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS181
00:20:48,00 --> 00:20:56,50
She touches his forehead and, suddenly, creepy crawlers begin to slither around under his skin. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS182
00:20:54,00 --> 00:21:02,50
The hunter's eyes roll slightly as he starts to dig into the mulch and devour the insects within. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS183
00:21:00,00 --> 00:21:05,50
The witch watches and snickers. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS184
00:21:06,00 --> 00:21:12,50
Later, SOMEONE<Jackson>, SOMEONE<Hansel> and SOMEONE<Gretel> sit in a pub. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS185
00:23:15,00 --> 00:23:20,50
The survivor from the forest staggers into the pub. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS186
00:23:19,00 --> 00:23:24,50
He stumbles toward the center of the pub. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS187
00:23:39,00 --> 00:23:44,50
The tracker starts to gag and retch. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS188
00:23:41,00 --> 00:23:46,50
SOMEONE moves SOMEONE  in front of him as a shield. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS189
00:23:44,00 --> 00:23:51,50
The man explodes from his stomach sending gore flying in all directions. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS191
00:23:53,00 --> 00:23:58,50
Maggots lie among the remains of the tracker. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS192
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:05,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> wipes away from some SOMEONE<debris>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS193
00:24:06,00 --> 00:24:15,50
In the dark forest, amid the dense tangle of narrow trees, a tree root snakes across the ground 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS194
00:24:12,00 --> 00:24:18,50
and buries deep into the earth to the witches lair. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS195
00:24:19,00 --> 00:24:25,50
It branches out to form cages, which imprison missing children. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS196
00:24:28,00 --> 00:24:36,50
They cower in their cells as a monstrous troll passes by throwing food from a bucket into their prisons. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS197
00:24:37,00 --> 00:24:42,50
The troll throws the bucket aside 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS198
00:24:39,00 --> 00:24:47,50
and stomps into a dining room where the dark haired witch places two bowls in front of her cohorts. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS199
00:24:46,00 --> 00:24:51,50
who take them and drink eagerly. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS200
00:24:53,00 --> 00:25:01,50
One of the witches, who has short spiky hair, sets her bowl down and raises her hands in wonder. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS201
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:10,50
The head witch grabs her hand and pushes it down into a nearby flame. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS202
00:25:18,00 --> 00:25:22,50
The third witch grins. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS203
00:25:29,00 --> 00:25:33,50
She cradles her singed hand. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS204
00:25:39,00 --> 00:25:44,50
The town is silent under the night sky. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS205
00:25:41,00 --> 00:25:48,50
Nothing stirs and only a few flickering lamps release the darkness. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS206
00:25:46,00 --> 00:25:52,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> sleeps deeply, her hands folded beneath her head. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS207
00:25:49,00 --> 00:25:56,50
She dreams of her mother the night that the siblings were taken into the forest 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS208
00:26:02,00 --> 00:26:07,50
and of the father leading them deeper into the woods. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS209
00:26:13,00 --> 00:26:19,50
She wakes up and looks down at her brother who is sleeping on the floor. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS210
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:51,50
He rolls over dismissively. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS211
00:26:52,00 --> 00:26:56,50
SOMEONE pauses a moment 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS212
00:26:53,00 --> 00:26:59,50
then gets out of the bed and walks to the window in her nightdress. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS213
00:27:00,00 --> 00:27:07,50
She looks out, her hand resting near the celestial map of the bloodmoon. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS214
00:27:08,00 --> 00:27:11,50
In the morning, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS215
00:27:09,00 --> 00:27:14,50
SOMEONE's<Hansel's> buying clothes at a local shop. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS216
00:27:24,00 --> 00:27:30,50
He rolls up the boy's garment as SOMEONE<Mina> approaches him from behind. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS217
00:27:45,00 --> 00:27:49,50
He walks away. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS218
00:28:04,00 --> 00:28:08,50
SOMEONE<Mina> pauses. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS219
00:28:15,00 --> 00:28:19,50
He checks his wrist-timer. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS220
00:28:21,00 --> 00:28:27,50
He hands a pumpkin and lowers himself carefully onto a stoop. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS221
00:28:30,00 --> 00:28:35,50
He removes a syringe from his bag. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS222
00:28:47,00 --> 00:28:52,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> injects himself. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS223
00:29:03,00 --> 00:29:10,50
He repacks his syringe and gets up, smiling a little awkwardly at SOMEONE<Mina>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS224
00:29:30,00 --> 00:29:35,50
SOMEONE<Mina> watches SOMEONE<Hansel> leave. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS226
00:29:35,00 --> 00:29:42,50
In the forest, the spiky haired witch examines some frogs clambering in the moss on a tree. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS227
00:29:40,00 --> 00:29:44,50
She picks one up. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS228
00:29:56,00 --> 00:30:02,50
She approaches the figure of a boy sitting on a fallen tree trunk. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS229
00:30:14,00 --> 00:30:19,50
The pumpkin falls from under a wig. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS230
00:30:20,00 --> 00:30:25,50
She looks, confused, at a gramophone. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS231
00:30:25,00 --> 00:30:29,50
She picks up the record. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS232
00:30:27,00 --> 00:30:32,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> and SOMEONE<Gretel> attack the witch. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS233
00:30:37,00 --> 00:30:41,50
SOMEONE<Jackson> appears from the underbrush. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS234
00:30:39,00 --> 00:30:44,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> advances cautiously. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS235
00:30:42,00 --> 00:30:49,50
The witch suddenly moves, disarming SOMEONE<Gretel> and aiming her crossbow at SOMEONE<Hansel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS236
00:30:46,00 --> 00:30:52,50
He swiftly bends backwards, just missing the path of the bolt. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS237
00:30:50,00 --> 00:30:56,50
SOMEONE jumps on top of the hag and tries to reach her wand, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS238
00:30:53,00 --> 00:30:58,50
but gets thrown off onto SOMEONE<Hansel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS239
00:30:59,00 --> 00:31:06,50
SOMEONE<Jackson> charges the witch, but she easily fells him and starts to make her escape. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS240
00:31:04,00 --> 00:31:09,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> and SOMEONE<Gretel> both follow in hot pursuit. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS241
00:31:07,00 --> 00:31:12,50
She grabs her broom and takes flight. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS242
00:31:10,00 --> 00:31:16,50
SOMEONE charges ahead and knocks her off mid-air 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS243
00:31:14,00 --> 00:31:19,50
using his gun like a baseball bat. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS244
00:31:17,00 --> 00:31:23,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> runs up behind the witch and a battle ensues. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS245
00:31:21,00 --> 00:31:26,50
When SOMEONE<Hansel> tries to grab his fallen weapon, the witch uses the prongs on the end of her broom to sweep it out of his reach. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS246
00:31:24,00 --> 00:31:31,50
When SOMEONE<Hansel> tries to grab his fallen weapon, the witch uses the prongs on the end of her broom to sweep it out of his reach. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS247
00:31:29,00 --> 00:31:36,50
The witch gains the upper hand, knocking down both SOMEONE<Hansel> and SOMEONE<Gretel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS248
00:31:34,00 --> 00:31:39,50
She once again mounts her brom and soars through the forest. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS249
00:31:37,00 --> 00:31:43,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> throws out a grappling hook and snags her broom. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS250
00:31:44,00 --> 00:31:51,50
He attaches her to his belt and is dragged across the ground behind the fleeing hag. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS251
00:31:50,00 --> 00:31:57,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> anchors his feet against two trees causing the broom to pull out from under the witch. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS252
00:31:56,00 --> 00:32:01,50
She hits a tree and crumples to the ground. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS253
00:31:59,00 --> 00:32:05,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> and SOMEONE<Gretel> advance as the witch gets to her feet. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS254
00:32:02,00 --> 00:32:08,50
Just as she raises her hand to cast a spell, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS255
00:32:05,00 --> 00:32:11,50
SOMEONE<Jackson> jumps out from behind and electrocutes her. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS258
00:32:31,00 --> 00:32:41,50
Back in town, SOMEONE<Berringer> watches the Mayor leave and then looks up at the cell where the spiky haired witch is being interrogated by SOMEONE<Hansel> and SOMEONE<Gretel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS259
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:55,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> dons a set of brass knuckles. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS261
00:33:01,00 --> 00:33:05,50
Blood gurgles from the witches mouth. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS262
00:33:40,00 --> 00:33:46,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> rummages through the missing children's files. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS263
00:34:08,00 --> 00:34:13,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> rushes out of the room. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS264
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:23,50
High above the town, SOMEONE<Muriel> and her other witch, one with red hair, hover menacingly, surveying the town and its sleeping inhabitants. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS265
00:34:23,00 --> 00:34:27,50
The red-haired witch swoops down. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS266
00:34:39,00 --> 00:34:45,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> sparks a ball of fire and holds it in her palm. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS267
00:34:55,00 --> 00:35:01,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> takes aim and casts the fireball towards the town. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS268
00:35:11,00 --> 00:35:16,50
Little SOMEONE<Mary> sleeps peacefully in her bed. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS269
00:35:13,00 --> 00:35:20,50
Outside the bedroom, her older brother and mother keep watch nervously. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS270
00:35:19,00 --> 00:35:26,50
In town, people urgently try to douse the blaze of SOMEONE's<Muriel's> fireball. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS271
00:35:34,00 --> 00:35:41,50
The door explodes open and the red-haired witch stalks into the house. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS272
00:35:44,00 --> 00:35:50,50
She hexes the rifle he is holding and forces him to point it towards his mother. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS273
00:35:52,00 --> 00:35:56,50
She is blown out of the window. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS274
00:36:02,00 --> 00:36:06,50
SOMEONE<Mary> is thrown in a cage. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS275
00:36:06,00 --> 00:36:12,50
The troll closes the cage and lifts it on his back. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS276
00:36:25,00 --> 00:36:30,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> locks the spiky-haired witch in a cell. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS277
00:36:48,00 --> 00:36:58,50
The door shatters and Muriel, as a woman, saunters through the SOMEONE<debris> as Gretel, standing on the balcony, aims her crossbow at her. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS278
00:37:04,00 --> 00:37:09,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> picks up a missing child's poster. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS279
00:37:18,00 --> 00:37:24,50
With a wicked smile, SOMEONE<Muriel> morphs into a witch. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS280
00:37:27,00 --> 00:37:33,50
SOMEONE<Jackson> opens fire as SOMEONE<Muriel> charges at the stairs. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS281
00:37:32,00 --> 00:37:38,50
The witch grabs him and throws him, shattering the bannister as he falls. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS283
00:37:37,00 --> 00:37:45,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> pulls out a knife and swings, but SOMEONE<Muriel> disarms her and grabs her by the throat. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS284
00:37:48,00 --> 00:37:53,50
The retreating troll turns to look at SOMEONE 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS285
00:37:56,00 --> 00:38:01,50
just as the red-haired witch tackles him to the ground. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS286
00:38:02,00 --> 00:38:07,50
They exchange blows. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS287
00:38:06,00 --> 00:38:12,50
SOMEONE grabs a milk bottle and uses it to bludgeon the hag 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS288
00:38:14,00 --> 00:38:20,50
who then hexes a box and hurls it at SOMEONE<Hansel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS289
00:38:22,00 --> 00:38:28,50
The crone then grabs her broom and starts to take off. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS290
00:38:26,00 --> 00:38:33,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> takes a running jump and catches hold of the broom as the witch flees town. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS291
00:38:34,00 --> 00:38:41,50
He slams through part of a roof, which shatters, while he is still clinging to the broom. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS292
00:38:39,00 --> 00:38:43,50
In the Sheriff's office, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS293
00:38:48,00 --> 00:38:53,50
SOMEONE<Jackson> struggles to his feet. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS294
00:38:59,00 --> 00:39:05,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> notices SOMEONE<Jackson> reaching for his gun. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS295
00:39:02,00 --> 00:39:08,50
She throw SOMEONE<Gretel> away from her as she turns to divert the bullets. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS297
00:39:10,00 --> 00:39:14,50
SOMEONE<Ben> watches SOMEONE<Gretel> fall. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS299
00:39:19,00 --> 00:39:25,50
SOMEONE<Jackson> struggles to reload the shotgun as SOMEONE<Muriel> stalks him. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS300
00:39:28,00 --> 00:39:33,50
She casts a spell with her wand 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS302
00:39:33,00 --> 00:39:39,50
and slowly directs the barrel of the gun to his head. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS303
00:39:40,00 --> 00:39:45,50
SOMEONE<Jackson> looks on, whimpering. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS304
00:39:47,00 --> 00:39:52,50
The gun rests under SOMEONE's<Jackson's> chin. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS305
00:39:57,00 --> 00:40:04,50
SOMEONE<Ben> uses a wheelbarrow to transport Gretel, injured and unconscious, through the streets. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS307
00:40:08,00 --> 00:40:14,50
Inside, SOMEONE<Muriel> frees the horned witch and then looks for SOMEONE<Gretel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS308
00:40:14,00 --> 00:40:22,50
It's morning and SOMEONE<Gretel> lies sleeping peacefully as a hand with a damp clothe wipes her face. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS309
00:40:24,00 --> 00:40:29,50
SOMEONE<Ben> moistens the cloth and starts to clean her neck. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS310
00:40:30,00 --> 00:40:38,50
He looks around for a moment and then proceeds to clean her chest, which rises and falls slowly. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS311
00:40:40,00 --> 00:40:46,50
Just as he is about to approach her cleavage with the clothe, she grabs his hand. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS312
00:40:45,00 --> 00:40:49,50
She glares at him. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS313
00:40:53,00 --> 00:40:59,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> shoots SOMEONE<Ben> a sceptical glance before releasing his hand. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS314
00:40:59,00 --> 00:41:04,50
She looks around her and out of the window. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS315
00:41:27,00 --> 00:41:32,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> notices a drawing of herself on the wall. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS316
00:41:29,00 --> 00:41:34,50
SOMEONE<Ben> looks at her sheepishly. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS317
00:41:50,00 --> 00:41:56,50
SOMEONE<Ben> looks down as SOMEONE<Gretel> turns to the wall. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS318
00:42:27,00 --> 00:42:34,50
At the dining table, SOMEONE<Gretel> reads SOMEONE<Ben> scrapbook of newspaper clippings. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS319
00:42:39,00 --> 00:42:44,50
SOMEONE<Ben> sets the bowl down and pulls a chair forward. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS320
00:43:01,00 --> 00:43:08,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> turns a page and stops to stare at an etching of a woman. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS321
00:43:07,00 --> 00:43:13,50
Moving closer to the book, she points to the face. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS322
00:43:13,00 --> 00:43:17,50
SOMEONE<Ben> leans froward. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS323
00:43:33,00 --> 00:43:37,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> has flashbacks of her mother. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS324
00:43:36,00 --> 00:43:41,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> dangles from a tree, unconscious. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS325
00:43:45,00 --> 00:43:49,50
He awakens. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS326
00:44:03,00 --> 00:44:07,50
She points to her right. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS327
00:44:30,00 --> 00:44:34,50
He falls to the ground. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS328
00:44:38,00 --> 00:44:43,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> tramps through another part of the woods. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS329
00:44:46,00 --> 00:44:52,50
Twisted roots lie among the towering trees. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS330
00:44:54,00 --> 00:45:01,50
SOMEONE<Mina> cleans SOMEONE's<Hansel's> wounds by a body of water situated in a gully. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS331
00:45:04,00 --> 00:45:08,50
She dampens the clothe again 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS332
00:45:11,00 --> 00:45:16,50
and dabs at his neck with the clothe. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS333
00:45:25,00 --> 00:45:31,50
SOMEONE<Mina> looks at the pool with uncertainty, then back at SOMEONE<Hansel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS334
00:45:46,00 --> 00:45:50,50
She stands up and starts to disrobe. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS336
00:45:57,00 --> 00:46:02,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> gets up and turns his back to her. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS337
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:08,50
Mina, now naked, delicately steps into the pool, her skin glowing. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS338
00:46:08,00 --> 00:46:13,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> steals a glance and is transfixed. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS339
00:46:14,00 --> 00:46:20,50
SOMEONE<Mina> smiles at him as he enters the water. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS340
00:46:32,00 --> 00:46:36,50
She moves towards SOMEONE<Hansel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS341
00:46:39,00 --> 00:46:43,50
She kisses him. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS342
00:46:44,00 --> 00:46:48,50
They embrace passionately. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS343
00:46:48,00 --> 00:46:53,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> continues walking through the woods, looking around. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS344
00:46:57,00 --> 00:47:03,50
Nearby, the troll looks up from his meal of wild boar. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS345
00:47:00,00 --> 00:47:05,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> stops near a fallen tree. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS346
00:47:07,00 --> 00:47:13,50
She notices movement in the distance and cautiously investigates, her crossbow at the ready. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS348
00:47:16,00 --> 00:47:23,50
She takes aim and moves silently towards the figure hidden by the branches. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS349
00:47:23,00 --> 00:47:29,50
As she draws closer, she pushes the tree limbs aside 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS350
00:47:26,00 --> 00:47:32,50
and sees one of the sheriff's deputies standing by the tree. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS351
00:47:36,00 --> 00:47:42,50
A man assaults her, forcing her into a clearing. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS352
00:47:40,00 --> 00:47:44,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> fights back. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS353
00:47:45,00 --> 00:47:51,50
Three deputies restrain her by holding her arms and hair. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS354
00:47:48,00 --> 00:47:53,50
The Sheriff approaches. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS355
00:48:16,00 --> 00:48:23,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> lunges forward and bites the tip of SOMEONE's<Berringer's> nose off, then pulls back and spits the piece in his face. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS358
00:48:26,00 --> 00:48:34,50
He approaches her with a bloody face, his teeth clenched in fury and pain, and strikes SOMEONE<Gretel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS359
00:48:33,00 --> 00:48:39,50
The troll watches from the trees as she falls to the ground. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS360
00:48:41,00 --> 00:48:45,50
The Sheriff kicks her in the stomach. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS361
00:48:44,00 --> 00:48:49,50
The troll crashes through the tree. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS362
00:48:54,00 --> 00:49:03,50
The giant grabs a tree trunk and wields it like a club, smashing two of the deputies. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS363
00:49:01,00 --> 00:49:05,50
He clubs another man in the head. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS365
00:49:06,00 --> 00:49:11,50
The last deputy tries shooting the troll. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS366
00:49:09,00 --> 00:49:16,50
Unfazed by the bullets, he crushes the last deputy's head. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS367
00:49:16,00 --> 00:49:22,50
The troll then walks up to SOMEONE, who has fallen on the ground. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS369
00:49:21,00 --> 00:49:26,50
The troll stomps on his head, his brains and blood splattering on the ground. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS371
00:49:28,00 --> 00:49:35,50
SOMEONE's<Gretel's> vision of the monster starts to blur as she passes out. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS372
00:49:37,00 --> 00:49:43,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> awakens to the gentle rocking motion of being carried. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS373
00:49:41,00 --> 00:49:46,50
She looks behind her to see and unfamiliar path in the woods. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS374
00:49:44,00 --> 00:49:50,50
She turns her head to find the side of the troll's head. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS375
00:49:52,00 --> 00:49:59,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> closes her eyes and leans her head to rest against the giant's shoulder. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS376
00:49:56,00 --> 00:50:02,50
They continue down the path, disappearing into the forest. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS378
00:50:18,00 --> 00:50:23,50
Back at the gully, SOMEONE<Hansel> kisses SOMEONE<Mina>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS379
00:50:21,00 --> 00:50:26,50
The troll settles SOMEONE<Gretel> down by a waterfall. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS380
00:50:27,00 --> 00:50:33,50
He sticks his finger into a crevice and pulls out a pale substance. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS381
00:50:32,00 --> 00:50:39,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> begins to wake and tries to get away when she sees the giant. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS382
00:50:40,00 --> 00:50:47,50
The troll holds her down and wipes the material on her injury. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS383
00:50:44,00 --> 00:50:52,50
He then places a dried mushroom under the waterfall like a cup to collect water, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS384
00:50:52,00 --> 00:50:56,50
which he then offers to SOMEONE<Gretel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS385
00:51:03,00 --> 00:51:11,50
She quickly gulps the water down to pacify him and watches the giant with trepidation. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS386
00:51:17,00 --> 00:51:24,50
SOMEONE stares wide-eyed as the troll nods in satisfaction and then walks away. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS387
00:51:22,00 --> 00:51:26,50
A little while later, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS388
00:51:23,00 --> 00:51:30,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> has managed to remove most of the dirt and blood from her face. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS389
00:51:27,00 --> 00:51:33,50
The troll sits across from her and she watches him curiously. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS390
00:51:47,00 --> 00:51:51,50
He looks down, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS391
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:53,50
then gets up in a huff. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS392
00:51:58,00 --> 00:52:02,50
He stops and turns around, her gaze is soft. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS394
00:52:10,00 --> 00:52:15,50
With a last look, the troll leaves. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS395
00:52:18,00 --> 00:52:23,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> looks around in frustration. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS396
00:52:25,00 --> 00:52:31,50
The day passes and gives way to night over the dense forest. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS397
00:52:30,00 --> 00:52:37,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> comes to a stop at the edge of a dell when he stops an abandoned cottage. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS398
00:52:34,00 --> 00:52:40,50
He looks around with a furrowed brow as he walks towards the house. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS399
00:52:45,00 --> 00:52:52,50
He stops midway to the house to pick up a rock, which he hurls at the building. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS400
00:52:56,00 --> 00:53:02,50
He bends down and picks up a log to act as a club. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS401
00:53:03,00 --> 00:53:08,50
Approaching the cottage with a little more bravado, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS402
00:53:06,00 --> 00:53:12,50
he enters, the rusty hedges of the door squeaking in protest. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS404
00:53:19,00 --> 00:53:26,50
Inside the house, he walks past two eerily familiar children's beds. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS405
00:53:23,00 --> 00:53:29,50
when suddenly, a figure charges at him from behind the door and they both crash through a rotten floorboard into a cave below. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS406
00:53:42,00 --> 00:53:46,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> embraces her brother. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS407
00:54:01,00 --> 00:54:07,50
Tears fill her eyes as SOMEONE<Hansel> holds her. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS408
00:54:11,00 --> 00:54:17,50
With a creased brow, SOMEONE<Hansel> looks around the cave. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS409
00:54:20,00 --> 00:54:25,50
With difficulty, he gets to his feet. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS410
00:54:28,00 --> 00:54:33,50
They start to investigate the area. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS411
00:54:31,00 --> 00:54:36,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> lights a match and then a candle. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS412
00:54:37,00 --> 00:54:45,50
The glow of the candle illuminates an ancient text woven with herbs and strange letters. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS413
00:54:43,00 --> 00:54:47,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> turns a page. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS414
00:55:00,00 --> 00:55:07,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> heaves himself out from the underground dwelling and then reaches down to help SOMEONE<Gretel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS415
00:55:05,00 --> 00:55:11,50
She then raises the candle to look around the interior. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS416
00:55:10,00 --> 00:55:18,50
She turns and walks over to SOMEONE<Hansel>, who is holding a toy and standing at the foot of one of the small beds. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS417
00:55:27,00 --> 00:55:31,50
He takes the candle. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS418
00:55:40,00 --> 00:55:47,50
He places his hand on a faded drawing on the wall of two kids and an animal. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS419
00:55:51,00 --> 00:55:56,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> sits on the bed and leans back. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS420
00:56:01,00 --> 00:56:09,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> give SOMEONE<Hansel> a pensive loo and she watches him as he surveys the abandoned cottage. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS421
00:56:16,00 --> 00:56:21,50
SOMEONE's<Hansel's> expression hardens and he stands up. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS422
00:56:35,00 --> 00:56:39,50
She points to the cellar. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS423
00:56:54,00 --> 00:57:00,50
SOMEONE throws a metal rod at Muriel, who deflects it with her wand 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS424
00:56:59,00 --> 00:57:05,50
and cuts off their escape route through the door. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS425
00:57:15,00 --> 00:57:20,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> and SOMEONE<Gretel> exchange and uneasy glance. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS426
00:57:24,00 --> 00:57:29,50
She points her wand at the hearth and a fire appears. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS427
00:57:42,00 --> 00:57:47,50
A flashback of the siblings youth. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS428
00:57:46,00 --> 00:57:51,50
The night of their abandonment. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS431
00:58:53,00 --> 00:58:58,50
His feet flail as he dies. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS432
01:00:01,00 --> 01:00:07,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> pulls out a knife and battles SOMEONE<Muriel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS433
01:00:05,00 --> 01:00:12,50
Using her unnatural strength, she grabs SOMEONE<Hansel> and stabs him in the stomach. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS434
01:00:15,00 --> 01:00:20,50
She stabs him again and pushes him down into the cellar. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS435
01:00:20,00 --> 01:00:24,50
SOMEONE<she> grabs SOMEONE<Hansel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS436
01:00:23,00 --> 01:00:30,50
It's morning in the abandoned cottage and SOMEONE<Hansel> wakes up to find SOMEONE<Mina> tending to his wound. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS437
01:00:31,00 --> 01:00:35,50
He pushes aside the bowl. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS438
01:00:36,00 --> 01:00:42,50
He looks around at the accoutrements of a witch scattered around him. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS439
01:00:47,00 --> 01:00:55,50
He stands and lifts his shirt to examine his wound which is almost completely healed. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS440
01:01:16,00 --> 01:01:21,50
He pushes past her, confused. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS441
01:02:24,00 --> 01:02:30,50
He reveals a cart loaded with armaments and ammunition. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS442
01:02:34,00 --> 01:02:40,50
SOMEONE blesses some fluid using an incantation from the book 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS443
01:02:38,00 --> 01:02:44,50
and then splashes the liquid liberally all over the ammunition. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS444
01:02:41,00 --> 01:02:46,50
The group chooses weapons from the cart. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS445
01:02:48,00 --> 01:02:55,50
SOMEONE climbs onto his horse and turns to SOMEONE who  is holding the reigns of the steed. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS446
01:02:53,00 --> 01:03:01,50
SOMEONE<Ben> lets the reigns go and shoots SOMEONE<Hansel> an awkward smile as his eyes dart side to side. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS447
01:03:09,00 --> 01:03:14,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> helps SOMEONE<Ben> mount the horse. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS448
01:03:11,00 --> 01:03:17,50
From behind, SOMEONE<Ben> grasps SOMEONE's<Hansel's> gun. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS449
01:03:16,00 --> 01:03:20,50
The group leaves town. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS450
01:03:21,00 --> 01:03:28,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> regains consciousness and discovers herself imprisoned in the witches lair. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS451
01:03:26,00 --> 01:03:30,50
SOMEONE<Edward> approaches her cell. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS452
01:03:41,00 --> 01:03:46,50
A door opens behind them. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS453
01:03:47,00 --> 01:03:53,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> looks around and notices the missing children in cages. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS454
01:03:56,00 --> 01:04:02,50
She puts her tiny hand on the trolls giant finger. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS455
01:04:15,00 --> 01:04:20,50
The spiky-haired witch turns to SOMEONE<Gretel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS456
01:04:23,00 --> 01:04:32,50
In the forest, late at night, SOMEONE<Hansel> and SOMEONE<Mina> create a network of tightly stretched thin wires between trees. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS457
01:04:39,00 --> 01:04:48,50
They stop and look at the top of a hill where a fire glows in the darkness marking the place of the witches Sabbath. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS458
01:04:48,00 --> 01:04:52,50
He gives SOMEONE<Ben> a gun. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS459
01:05:00,00 --> 01:05:08,50
SOMEONE<Ben> looks up at the full moon as numerous witches glide into the clearing on top of the hill to join the throng. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS460
01:05:15,00 --> 01:05:23,50
Castors of all shapes and sizes mingle at the gathering in their outrageous costumes. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS461
01:05:24,00 --> 01:05:31,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> is dragged to a dead and deteriorated tree as SOMEONE<Muriel> floats in. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS462
01:05:29,00 --> 01:05:36,50
The spiky-haired witch punches her in the stomach before chaining her to the tree. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS463
01:05:34,00 --> 01:05:42,50
The assembled witches turn to look at SOMEONE<Muriel> as SOMEONE<Edward> leads the children into the middle of the gathering. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS464
01:05:41,00 --> 01:05:49,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> lights a fire under a giant cauldron and the liquid within begins to bubble. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS465
01:06:19,00 --> 01:06:26,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> walks away as SOMEONE<Mina> looks out at the gathered witches below. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS466
01:06:26,00 --> 01:06:31,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> stares at the bloodmoon. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS468
01:06:44,00 --> 01:06:49,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> walks into the clearing. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS469
01:06:49,00 --> 01:06:53,50
The hags turn to him. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS470
01:07:07,00 --> 01:07:13,50
The read-haired witch walks in front of SOMEONE<Hansel> and raises her wand. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS471
01:07:11,00 --> 01:07:16,50
Everyone watches the standoff eagerly as neither SOMEONE<Hansel> or the witch budges. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS472
01:07:14,00 --> 01:07:19,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> takes off the red-haired witches head with a single shot. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS474
01:07:23,00 --> 01:07:29,50
SOMEONE<Mina> takes the cue and maneuvers the machine gun into position. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS475
01:07:28,00 --> 01:07:35,50
The witches are cutdown down in great swathes by the rapid fire. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS477
01:07:35,00 --> 01:07:41,50
SOMEONE and the spiky-haired witch dive for cover behind a rock as the other crones start scatter and flee. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS478
01:07:38,00 --> 01:07:43,50
Some managing to get on their brooms. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS479
01:07:44,00 --> 01:07:52,50
SOMEONE uses a combination of hand grenades and rifle fire to take down the numerous targets 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS480
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:58,50
while SOMEONE<Mina> starts to pick off the flying hags as they soar away from the clearing. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS482
01:07:58,00 --> 01:08:05,50
As the fighting intensifies, SOMEONE<Hansel> uses his rifle and his bayonet to slash and stab the witches. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS483
01:08:02,00 --> 01:08:09,50
SOMEONE<Edward> abandons the children that are huddled against the rock face. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS484
01:08:10,00 --> 01:08:19,50
The spiky-haired witch runs toward the children and uses another witch as a shield to avoid being shot by SOMEONE<Mina>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS485
01:08:18,00 --> 01:08:23,50
Suddenly, her gun jams. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS486
01:08:20,00 --> 01:08:25,50
a witch takes flight toward SOMEONE's<mina's> position. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS487
01:08:24,00 --> 01:08:29,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> shoots the attacking witch in the back. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS488
01:08:29,00 --> 01:08:37,50
SOMEONE jumps out of hiding as a large witch tries to hex SOMEONE but misses and hits a tree, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS489
01:08:36,00 --> 01:08:41,50
which falls and crushes her. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS490
01:08:42,00 --> 01:08:49,50
The spiky-haired witch gathers the children as SOMEONE<Muriel> stalks toward SOMEONE<Gretel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS491
01:08:51,00 --> 01:08:59,50
Just as SOMEONE<Muriel> is about to strike Gretel, SOMEONE<Edward> blocks her advance and knocks the witch aside. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS492
01:09:08,00 --> 01:09:14,50
Right as the horned-witch is about to execute a little girl, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS493
01:09:11,00 --> 01:09:16,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> shoots her in the abdomen. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS494
01:09:16,00 --> 01:09:22,50
She collapses to the ground and looks up as SOMEONE<Hansel> takes aim at her head. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS495
01:09:20,00 --> 01:09:24,50
The onlooking children wince. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS496
01:09:24,00 --> 01:09:32,50
SOMEONE<Edward> pulls apart one of SOMEONE's<Gretel's> bindings just as SOMEONE<Muriel> throws him off the cliff with her wand. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS497
01:09:30,00 --> 01:09:37,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> wraps a chain around her fist and charges Muriel, knocking her to the ground. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS498
01:09:37,00 --> 01:09:42,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> frees the children from their fetters. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS499
01:09:40,00 --> 01:09:46,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> swings at SOMEONE<Gretel> with a knife, as SOMEONE<Hansel> frees the last child. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS500
01:09:45,00 --> 01:09:52,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> turns to help SOMEONE<Gretel> but is confronted by siamese twin witches joined at the back. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS501
01:09:50,00 --> 01:09:56,50
The duo attacks him ferociously with long blades. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS502
01:09:54,00 --> 01:10:00,50
SOMEONE<Mina> grabs some weapons and runs to join the fray. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS503
01:09:58,00 --> 01:10:05,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> and SOMEONE<Gretel> fight desperately with SOMEONE<Muriel> gaining the upper hand. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS504
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:08,50
She throw the hunter to the ground and crouches over her with a weapon. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS505
01:10:06,00 --> 01:10:11,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> grabs the knife hand and the two struggle for dominance. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS506
01:10:10,00 --> 01:10:15,50
The sun starts to rise over the horizon. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS507
01:10:16,00 --> 01:10:23,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> headbutts SOMEONE<Muriel> who staggers away and grabs her broom to retreat. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS508
01:10:25,00 --> 01:10:31,50
SOMEONE throws a twin crossbow to SOMEONE who catches it 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS509
01:10:28,00 --> 01:10:34,50
and dispatches two witches that were charging her from opposite sides. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS510
01:10:32,00 --> 01:10:42,50
She then picks up a spiky chain and lassoes at around the abdomen of a fleeing witch, who then explodes into tiny pieces. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS511
01:10:39,00 --> 01:10:46,50
One of the twins stabs SOMEONE<Hansel> in the leg and, as he falls, they dart towards him. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS512
01:10:44,00 --> 01:10:48,50
But he takes them out with a swing of his foot. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS513
01:10:46,00 --> 01:10:51,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> approaches with her crossbow. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS514
01:10:56,00 --> 01:11:02,50
In the forest, SOMEONE<Muriel> follows two other witches on their brooms. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS515
01:10:59,00 --> 01:11:05,50
They head for the trees with the wires stretched between them, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS516
01:11:02,00 --> 01:11:09,50
but the two are unable to stop in time and are sliced to bits by the taut strings. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS518
01:11:14,00 --> 01:11:19,50
SOMEONE<time,> comes to a halt in front of the trap and starts in another direction right past SOMEONE<Ben> whose resting against a tree trunk. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS521
01:11:22,00 --> 01:11:28,50
He looks over his shoulder eyeing her approach. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS522
01:11:25,00 --> 01:11:31,50
He lifts the rifle, takes careful aim and fires. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS523
01:11:31,00 --> 01:11:36,50
The spinning bullet unravels and explodes, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS525
01:11:37,00 --> 01:11:43,50
expelling bits of shrapnel that knock SOMEONE<Muriel> of her broom. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS526
01:11:54,00 --> 01:12:02,50
SOMEONE<hansel>, SOMEONE<Mina> and SOMEONE<Ben> run to the sight of impact which is scattered with shards of Muriels broom. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS527
01:12:03,00 --> 01:12:09,50
SOMEONE<Ben> picks up and pockets one of the pieces. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS528
01:12:10,00 --> 01:12:15,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> runs to Edwards side. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS529
01:12:15,00 --> 01:12:21,50
She opens her bag and pulls out the stun gun, 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS530
01:12:19,00 --> 01:12:24,50
charges the battery quickly 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS531
01:12:23,00 --> 01:12:28,50
and administers the electricity. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS532
01:12:29,00 --> 01:12:35,50
When the troll doesn't move, she checks his heartbeat and tries again. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS533
01:12:36,00 --> 01:12:41,50
She stabs the reeds into Edwards body. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS535
01:12:43,00 --> 01:12:50,50
He shakes himself awake as she rests her head on his shoulder in relief. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS536
01:12:50,00 --> 01:12:56,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Hansel> and the others track a wounded SOMEONE<Muriel> through the forest. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS537
01:12:54,00 --> 01:12:59,50
A bloody handprint on a tree provides a clue. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS538
01:13:03,00 --> 01:13:08,50
At the edge of a clearing, the group comes to a halt. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS539
01:13:06,00 --> 01:13:14,50
in the overgrown dell stands the derelict gingerbread house where SOMEONE<Hansel> and SOMEONE<Gretel> killed their first witch. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS540
01:13:12,00 --> 01:13:16,50
They advance cautiously. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS541
01:13:26,00 --> 01:13:32,50
Suddenly, SOMEONE<Mina> is thrown to the ground with a jolt. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS542
01:13:29,00 --> 01:13:37,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> whips around, weapon poised, to find SOMEONE<Muriel> holding her wand to SOMEONE's<Ben's> neck. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS543
01:13:52,00 --> 01:13:57,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> begins to put the gun on the ground. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS545
01:14:08,00 --> 01:14:19,50
He pulls out a pistol from behind his back and accidentally shoots SOMEONE<Ben> in the shoulder, just missing SOMEONE<Muriel> who then attacks him with enchanted logs. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS548
01:14:33,00 --> 01:14:40,50
SOMEONE<Mina> stands with her wand ready after assaulting SOMEONE<Muriel> with a spell. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS549
01:14:50,00 --> 01:14:55,50
He shatters a tree behind SOMEONE<Muriel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS551
01:14:53,00 --> 01:15:03,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> casts a spell and throws SOMEONE<Mina> against the house. The evil witch then materialises near SOMEONE<Mina> and grabs her. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS552
01:15:06,00 --> 01:15:11,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> stabs SOMEONE<Mina> with her wand. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS553
01:15:11,00 --> 01:15:15,50
SOMEONE<Mina> crumples to the ground. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS554
01:15:13,00 --> 01:15:19,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> fires at SOMEONE<Muriel> driving her into the pastry house. He runs to SOMEONE's<Mina's> side and turns

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS555
01:15:21,00 --> 01:15:26,50
He her over. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS556
01:15:49,00 --> 01:15:54,50
Her body relaxes in death. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS557
01:15:52,00 --> 01:15:59,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> lowers her corpse and looks toward the house, his expression hardening. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS558
01:16:01,00 --> 01:16:07,50
He somersaults into the house where the witch attacks him with a shovel. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS559
01:16:04,00 --> 01:16:10,50
The two grapple with each other as SOMEONE<Gretel> comes running up to the clearance. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS561
01:16:14,00 --> 01:16:20,50
SOMEONE<Grettel> charges into the house but is swiftly felled by the hag. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS562
01:16:18,00 --> 01:16:24,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> grabs a knife from a table and moves in to stab SOMEONE<Gretel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS563
01:16:21,00 --> 01:16:27,50
They struggle, each trying to gain the upper hand. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS564
01:16:26,00 --> 01:16:31,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> leaps into the fight, wrestling with the witch. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS566
01:16:33,00 --> 01:16:40,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> throws them onto SOMEONE<Gretel> and punches the both of them in the face. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS568
01:16:39,00 --> 01:16:43,50
The crone then tries to break his neck. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS569
01:16:43,00 --> 01:16:54,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> jumps onto SOMEONE's<Muriel's> back and the trio falls. The witch kicks SOMEONE<Hansel> into the wall and then picks SOMEONE<Gretel> up and throws her against the dusty oven

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS570
01:16:51,00 --> 01:16:55,50
knocking her unconscious. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS571
01:16:53,00 --> 01:16:58,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> then grabs a cleaver. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS572
01:16:57,00 --> 01:17:04,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> heaves a hanging cauldron into the witches face knocking her down. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS573
01:17:01,00 --> 01:17:09,50
He then wraps a chain around her neck and hoists her up using the oven door as a pulley. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS574
01:17:13,00 --> 01:17:18,50
He starts to punch her relentlessly. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS575
01:17:15,00 --> 01:17:22,50
SOMEONE's<Muriel's> face softens as she morphs into her human form. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS576
01:17:29,00 --> 01:17:35,50
He continues to pummel her and then starts to strangle SOMEONE<Muriel>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS577
01:17:32,00 --> 01:17:37,50
Her demon face reappears. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS578
01:17:34,00 --> 01:17:41,50
The witch grasps at SOMEONE's<Hansel's> shoulder in a vain attempt to make him let go. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS579
01:17:39,00 --> 01:17:45,50
She slowly starts to pas out when SOMEONE's<Hansel's> wrist-timer goes off. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS580
01:17:48,00 --> 01:17:54,50
He is unable to keep his hold on her and collapses to his knees. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS581
01:17:52,00 --> 01:17:57,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> looks for the syringe but cannot find it. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS582
01:17:55,00 --> 01:17:59,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> starts to wake up. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS583
01:18:01,00 --> 01:18:09,50
She spots his syringe on the ground as SOMEONE<Muriel> kicks SOMEONE<Hansel> aside and tries to free herself. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS585
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:19,50
Reaches for the syringe, drags herself towards her brother and injects him with the liquid. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS586
01:18:16,00 --> 01:18:23,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> kicks aside the prop that was keeping the oven door open. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS588
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:27,50
When she frees herself of the chain, she attacks SOMEONE<Gretel,>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS591
01:18:27,00 --> 01:18:34,50
SOMEONE beats her with a shovel and stabs her in the neck with the shovel's blade. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS593
01:18:35,00 --> 01:18:42,50
SOMEONE<Muriel> struggles as SOMEONE<Gretel> walks up and the siblings loom above her. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS594
01:18:43,00 --> 01:18:49,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> stamps hard on the blade severing SOMEONE's<Muriel's> head. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS596
01:18:47,00 --> 01:18:52,50
SOMEONE<Ben> runs into the house smiling. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS597
01:18:51,00 --> 01:18:57,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> turns around holding SOMEONE's<Muriel's> head by the hair. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS598
01:18:55,00 --> 01:18:59,50
SOMEONE<Ben> gulps at the sight. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS599
01:18:57,00 --> 01:19:03,50
SOMEONE<Hansel> throws the head into the open oven as the siblings walk past SOMEONE<Ben>. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS600
01:19:08,00 --> 01:19:14,50
SOMEONE<Gretel> picks up SOMEONE's<Muriel's> gem and its gem glows. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS601
01:19:21,00 --> 01:19:27,50
A crowd of townspeople stand around a large fire. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS602
01:19:27,00 --> 01:19:31,50
A man throws a pouch of coins, SOMEONE<Hansel> catches it. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS604
01:19:34,00 --> 01:19:39,50
The siblings walk away from the blaze. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS606
01:20:05,00 --> 01:20:10,50
In a dry and dusty desert, SOMEONE<Edward> pulls a cart of dead witches. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS607
01:20:26,00 --> 01:20:31,50
They stand outside a witches lair. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS608
01:20:39,00 --> 01:20:45,50
SOMEONE<Edward> pouches on the door which shatters forward. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS609
01:20:42,00 --> 01:20:49,50
Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. A blonde witch looks up and snarls at the intruders. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS611
01:20:49,00 --> 01:20:56,50
The demon backflips away from SOMEONE<Gretel>, trying to escape her machine gun's bullets. 

HANSEL_GRETEL_WITCH_HUNTERS_DVS613
01:20:55,00 --> 01:21:00,50
Leaving a trail of dust, she tries to escape out of a window, where SOMEONE<hansel> clubs her.
