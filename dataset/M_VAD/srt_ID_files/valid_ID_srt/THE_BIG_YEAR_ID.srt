THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS23
00:02:54,00 --> 00:02:59,50
Montclair, New Jersey. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS25
00:04:28,00 --> 00:04:32,50
He mimes being dead. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS26
00:04:34,00 --> 00:04:39,50
At his house in Vail, 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS27
00:05:06,00 --> 00:05:11,50
SOMEONE<Stu> steps forward and embraces SOMEONE<Edith>. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS28
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:16,50
Now, he and his wife and their party guests raise glasses. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS29
00:05:15,00 --> 00:05:20,50
A man with boyish features holds up a hand. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS30
00:05:51,00 --> 00:05:56,50
He puts an arm around his wife. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS31
00:05:59,00 --> 00:06:05,50
January 1st. SOMEONE<Bostick> pours himself coffee. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS32
00:06:17,00 --> 00:06:21,50
Now, four skiers stop on a slope. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS33
00:06:31,00 --> 00:06:37,50
SOMEONE<Stu> and his son take off down the mountainside. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS34
00:06:40,00 --> 00:06:45,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Bostick> pulls into the State Park. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS35
00:06:50,00 --> 00:06:57,50
He hangs a handicap-parking pass on his rear view mirror, then jumps out of the car. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS36
00:06:58,00 --> 00:07:02,50
He races into the woods. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS37
00:07:02,00 --> 00:07:07,50
On a mountain, a man spies on a bird. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS38
00:07:06,00 --> 00:07:10,50
A skier crashes into him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS39
00:07:13,00 --> 00:07:18,50
The girl's father drops his head into his folded arms. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS40
00:07:23,00 --> 00:07:29,50
Reaching a lake's edge, she spots a bird through his binoculars. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS42
00:07:29,00 --> 00:07:35,50
Turning, he sees a massive birder snapping shots of his find. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS43
00:07:35,00 --> 00:07:42,50
In Colorado, SOMEONE<Stu> and his son ski side by side down a slope. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS44
00:07:39,00 --> 00:07:45,50
Swerving off to the side, SOMEONE<Stu> skids to a stop. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS45
00:07:42,00 --> 00:07:46,50
His son looks over. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS46
00:07:46,00 --> 00:07:51,50
A tally appears, clicking from zero to one. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS47
00:07:49,00 --> 00:07:54,50
The tally ticks to two. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS48
00:07:51,00 --> 00:07:58,50
Now, an SUV screeches to a halt and SOMEONE<Stu> snaps a photo out his window. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS49
00:07:57,00 --> 00:08:02,50
The tally clicks to three. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS50
00:07:59,00 --> 00:08:05,50
Later, SOMEONE<Stu> packs his belongings into an SUV. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS51
00:08:05,00 --> 00:08:10,50
SOMEONE's<Stu's> Day One tally shows 29. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS52
00:08:08,00 --> 00:08:13,50
At the park, SOMEONE<Bostick> returns to his car. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS53
00:08:11,00 --> 00:08:21,50
His eyes widen and he races back into the woods. As his camera flashes, his Day One tally clicks from 30 to 31. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS54
00:08:18,00 --> 00:08:28,50
Now, a view through binoculars shows a flock of seagulls. Standing at an office window, SOMEONE<Brad> lowers the binoculars and sighs. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS55
00:08:25,00 --> 00:08:30,50
His Day One tally clicks to one. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS56
00:08:28,00 --> 00:08:33,50
Later, he sits at the dinner table with his father. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS57
00:08:39,00 --> 00:08:43,50
Smiling, SOMEONE's<Brad's> mom sits. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS58
00:08:54,00 --> 00:08:58,50
His dad lifts his brow. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS59
00:09:27,00 --> 00:09:32,50
SOMEONE<Brad> releases his fork. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS60
00:09:48,00 --> 00:09:53,50
SOMEONE<Brad> storms off. Now, with his boss. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS61
00:10:22,00 --> 00:10:26,50
He shows a photo of two kids. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS62
00:10:30,00 --> 00:10:34,50
SOMEONE<Brad> turns away. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS63
00:10:32,00 --> 00:10:35,50
He halts. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS64
00:10:40,00 --> 00:10:45,50
February 13th, Day 44. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS65
00:10:45,00 --> 00:10:49,50
SOMEONE<Stu> drives. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS66
00:10:54,00 --> 00:11:04,50
He brakes. A plane flies. A car arrives outside a Victorian style house. SOMEONE<Stu> passes through its gate and spots a sign - Stay on path. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS67
00:11:01,00 --> 00:11:11,50
Another reads, please ring bell for key. As an old woman answers the door, words appear- Gibson's, British Columbia. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS68
00:11:14,00 --> 00:11:19,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> arrives behind SOMEONE<Stu>. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS69
00:11:21,00 --> 00:11:26,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> runs to the back of the house. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS70
00:11:26,00 --> 00:11:31,50
She offers the key, then pulls it back. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS71
00:11:34,00 --> 00:11:38,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> climbs over a fence. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS72
00:11:41,00 --> 00:11:49,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> runs back to his car, his tally ticking to 159. The woman gives SOMEONE<Stu> the key. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS73
00:11:47,00 --> 00:11:56,50
In the heavy downpour, SOMEONE's<Bostick's> car peels away. As SOMEONE<Stu> follows the drenched path to the fence, he answers his cell phone. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS74
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:04,50
The key sticks in the gate's lock. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS75
00:12:03,00 --> 00:12:09,50
He tries ramming the gate with his shoulder as his associates listen. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS76
00:12:33,00 --> 00:12:44,50
Trying to climb the wood plank fence, SOMEONE<Stu> steps on a garden gnome posted at the gate. As he scans the garden, the ceramic sculpture shatters under his weight. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS77
00:12:41,00 --> 00:12:47,50
SOMEONE<Stu> turns to find the hummingbird flying over the gate. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS78
00:12:44,00 --> 00:12:51,50
His jaw drops as the emerald hued bird hovers over his head. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS79
00:12:48,00 --> 00:12:59,50
In slow motion, we watch the beats of its tiny wings. As it flies off, SOMEONE<Stu> beams after it and his tally ticks up to 158. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS80
00:12:57,00 --> 00:13:10,50
February 20th. Joshua Tree, California. SOMEONE<Brad> snaps photos as a skinny man in a turban seated nearby uses a laptop to write a blog titled The Joy of Birding with Ichabod Cranes. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS81
00:13:20,00 --> 00:13:24,50
SOMEONE<Brad> abruptly turns away, listening. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS82
00:13:27,00 --> 00:13:37,50
Climbing down off a boulder, he loses his footing and falls. Landing, he crawls along the ground, then flops over and snaps photos of a bird in flight. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS83
00:13:35,00 --> 00:13:39,50
His tally ticks to 132. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS84
00:13:42,00 --> 00:13:47,50
February 22nd. Coos Bay, Oregon. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS86
00:14:04,00 --> 00:14:09,50
On a dock, SOMEONE's<Annie's> eyes narrow as SOMEONE<Bostick> approaches. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS88
00:14:32,00 --> 00:14:36,50
SOMEONE<Annie> draws a knife. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS89
00:15:04,00 --> 00:15:09,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> signs autographs, then faces SOMEONE<Annie>. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS90
00:15:31,00 --> 00:15:37,50
Now, the boat travels over the tranquil waters of the Sound. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS91
00:15:34,00 --> 00:15:42,50
On the deck, a mustached birder performs a birdcall for a pretty brunette who listens keenly. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS92
00:15:55,00 --> 00:16:00,50
SOMEONE<Brad> nods humbly. The mustached man looks up. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS93
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:07,50
He moves off and others follow him. Nearby, a man cuts up fish on a board. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS94
00:16:04,00 --> 00:16:13,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> notices SOMEONE<Stu> popping pills nearby. He remembers passing by him at the house in Canada. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS95
00:16:30,00 --> 00:16:35,50
The workman dumps fish parts over the rail. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS96
00:17:06,00 --> 00:17:12,50
SOMEONE<Stu> queasily eyes the cutting board, then faces SOMEONE<Bostick>. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS97
00:17:16,00 --> 00:17:21,50
The older man vomits over the deck railing. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS98
00:17:20,00 --> 00:17:25,50
A workman hands over a crumpled rag. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS99
00:17:25,00 --> 00:17:31,50
Later, SOMEONE<Stu> rests on an indoor bench piled with luggage. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS100
00:17:29,00 --> 00:17:34,50
He feebly gives SOMEONE<Brad> the so-so gesture. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS101
00:18:18,00 --> 00:18:25,50
SOMEONE<Brad> points outside where birders flock around SOMEONE<Bostick> as he does bird calls. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS102
00:18:42,00 --> 00:18:47,50
As SOMEONE<Brad> shakes his head, both their tallies appear. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS104
00:18:46,00 --> 00:18:51,50
On land the mustached birder brings coffee. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS105
00:18:59,00 --> 00:19:04,50
Now, SOMEONE's<Brad's> mother uses a phone. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS106
00:19:51,00 --> 00:19:58,50
He angrily ends the call. Our view contracts around an owl in a nearby tapestry. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS107
00:19:55,00 --> 00:20:00,50
It comes to life and flies at us. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS108
00:19:58,00 --> 00:20:05,50
At the wheel of a car, SOMEONE<Bostick> wakes to find himself in the path of an 18-wheeler. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS109
00:20:03,00 --> 00:20:08,50
He wrenches the wheel, waking his companion. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS110
00:20:05,00 --> 00:20:13,50
Narrowly avoiding the truck, the car skids off the road and slams sideways into a tree. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS111
00:20:17,00 --> 00:20:26,50
Leaving the mustached birder in the passenger seat, SOMEONE<Bostick> lowers his window, then climbs out of the car through it. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS112
00:20:23,00 --> 00:20:30,50
He faces the tree, grimly inspecting the damage to the car's back door. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS113
00:20:29,00 --> 00:20:33,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> turns wide-eyed. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS114
00:20:35,00 --> 00:20:42,50
The champion birder ventures into the thick evergreen forest. In the passenger seat, 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS115
00:20:39,00 --> 00:20:46,50
the mustached birder keeps one arm at his side as he starts to turn in his seat. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS116
00:20:44,00 --> 00:20:50,50
He winces and unbuckles his seat belt, then reaches into the back. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS117
00:20:47,00 --> 00:20:52,50
He comes out following SOMEONE<Bostick>. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS118
00:20:52,00 --> 00:21:08,50
The champion looks up. Green leafy branches form a canopy overhead, but give no sign of a bird. He treks further into the woods. Shifting his searching gaze, SOMEONE<Bostick> moves a branch aside, then halts at the side of a black and white woodpecker. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS120
00:21:40,00 --> 00:21:47,50
Now, in a humble bathroom, SOMEONE<Stu> uses his cell phone as his socks dry on a line. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS121
00:21:50,00 --> 00:21:54,50
Brownfield, Texas. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS122
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:05,50
A view from her suite shows the Eiffel Tower. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS123
00:22:04,00 --> 00:22:11,50
Now, a toilet bursts through a window. It lands outside SOMEONE's<Bostick's> house. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS124
00:22:12,00 --> 00:22:16,50
SOMEONE<Jackson> Hole, Wyoming. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS125
00:22:49,00 --> 00:22:53,50
A handsome man arrives. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS126
00:23:01,00 --> 00:23:07,50
At an actual dump, SOMEONE<Stu> snacks on chips. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS127
00:23:05,00 --> 00:23:10,50
Other birders wretch and cover their noses. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS128
00:23:13,00 --> 00:23:21,50
Impervious to the stench, SOMEONE<Stu> photographs a bird among the refuse. His two associates arrive. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS129
00:23:24,00 --> 00:23:28,50
He photographs them. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS132
00:23:41,00 --> 00:23:45,50
SOMEONE<Stu> gets in a car. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS133
00:23:59,00 --> 00:24:14,50
SOMEONE<Stu> backs out of his parking spot. Now, April 19th, Day 109. A silver luxury car pulls up in front of the SOMEONE's<Bostick's> house. The champion birder gets out to find scaffolding framing the entire left wing of his home. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS134
00:24:11,00 --> 00:24:17,50
The upper left quarter stands stripped of its siding. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS135
00:24:14,00 --> 00:24:22,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> takes it in unhappily, then pulls his bags from the backseat and approaches the house. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS136
00:24:21,00 --> 00:24:26,50
The handsome man stands with an older man. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS137
00:24:43,00 --> 00:24:47,50
He goes inside. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS138
00:24:48,00 --> 00:24:53,50
He moves through a maze of exposed wood framework. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS139
00:24:55,00 --> 00:25:00,50
She emerges from the master bathroom. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS140
00:25:31,00 --> 00:25:35,50
She puts on a robe. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS141
00:26:12,00 --> 00:26:16,50
He grabs her. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS142
00:26:13,00 --> 00:26:18,50
Kissing her, he steers her to the bed. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS143
00:26:25,00 --> 00:26:29,50
He pauses from their kiss. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS144
00:26:31,00 --> 00:26:38,50
Straddling his lap, she kisses him back. The TV shows a weather report. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS145
00:26:40,00 --> 00:26:47,50
SOMEONE's<Bostick's> eyes stray to the TV. In a store, SOMEONE<Brad> watches the same report. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS146
00:26:49,00 --> 00:26:56,50
In New York, SOMEONE<Stu> watches the report on a TV behind his office building security desk. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS147
00:26:55,00 --> 00:27:00,50
SOMEONE<Jess> follows her husband's gaze. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS148
00:27:05,00 --> 00:27:14,50
He tosses her onto the bed and runs out. As he climbs into his car, SOMEONE<Jess> glares down from an open patch in a wall. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS149
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:20,50
She throws up her hands and SOMEONE<Bostick> speeds off. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS150
00:27:17,00 --> 00:27:24,50
From the yard, SOMEONE glances up at the disgruntled wife. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS151
00:27:21,00 --> 00:27:27,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Brad> races to his boss's office and bursts in. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS153
00:27:48,00 --> 00:27:51,50
SOMEONE<Bill> stares. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS154
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:04,50
He climbs into a car. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS155
00:28:04,00 --> 00:28:08,50
The vehicle peels out. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS156
00:28:06,00 --> 00:28:12,50
Later, the three birders talk on their cells. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS157
00:28:36,00 --> 00:28:42,50
A red line on a map tracks SOMEONE's<Brad's> progress to High Island. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS158
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:45,50
Now, people in cars flock into a grassy parking lot. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS159
00:28:43,00 --> 00:28:48,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> parks amid the crowd and gazes at the sky. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS160
00:28:49,00 --> 00:28:53,50
SOMEONE<Brad> gets out of his car. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS161
00:28:52,00 --> 00:28:58,50
Climbing out of his vehicle, SOMEONE<Stu> breaks into a smile. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS162
00:28:57,00 --> 00:29:05,50
Birds fill the sky above the trees, speckling it with clusters of black dots. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS163
00:29:02,00 --> 00:29:10,50
Racing to the front of the crowd, SOMEONE<Bostick> crosses in front of a cameraman filming a reporter. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS164
00:29:24,00 --> 00:29:28,50
He shoves past two men. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS165
00:29:30,00 --> 00:29:37,50
He flips them off as he gazes through his binoculars, then heads away. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS166
00:29:34,00 --> 00:29:42,50
Later, birds flit overhead as SOMEONE<Brad> walks a path in the woods, his eyes fixed skyward. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS167
00:29:40,00 --> 00:29:45,50
He lifts his binoculars to watch a red bird in a tree. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS168
00:29:52,00 --> 00:29:58,50
Gazing over SOMEONE's<Stu's> shoulder, SOMEONE<Brad> notices SOMEONE<Bostick>. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS169
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:06,50
They hurry after SOMEONE<Bostick>, who disappears into some trees. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS170
00:30:03,00 --> 00:30:13,50
As other birders look through binoculars and snap photos, SOMEONE<Bostick> rushes past them and briefly eyes a bird on a tree. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS171
00:30:10,00 --> 00:30:14,50
He runs off. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS172
00:30:11,00 --> 00:30:17,50
SOMEONE<Stu> and SOMEONE<Brad> stop as well to see the little yellow bird. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS173
00:30:18,00 --> 00:30:24,50
Slowing his pace, SOMEONE<Bostick> briefly peers through his binoculars. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS174
00:30:22,00 --> 00:30:28,50
He runs off. SOMEONE<Brad> and SOMEONE<Stu> arrive a moment later. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS175
00:30:29,00 --> 00:30:37,50
As they continue after SOMEONE<Bostick>, all of three of their tallies appear, counting up past 300. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS176
00:30:34,00 --> 00:30:43,50
Through his binoculars, SOMEONE<Brad> follows a bird, then spots the pretty brunette from the boat. She sees him and he waves. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS177
00:30:41,00 --> 00:30:46,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> steps into his line of sight. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS178
00:31:18,00 --> 00:31:26,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> sprints off. At a bridge, he picks up a little girl in a uniform who partially blocks the entrance and sets her aside. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS179
00:31:26,00 --> 00:31:30,50
SOMEONE<Stu> and SOMEONE<Brad> approach the bridge. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS180
00:31:32,00 --> 00:31:37,50
She gestures to a group of girls. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS181
00:31:37,00 --> 00:31:43,50
The two birders wait as the uniformed girls pass. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS182
00:31:41,00 --> 00:31:49,50
As the last explorer crosses, SOMEONE<Stu> and SOMEONE<Brad> hurry down the narrow bridge turning sideways to pass others. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS183
00:31:49,00 --> 00:31:54,50
They reach a platform looking out onto a lake. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS184
00:32:03,00 --> 00:32:09,50
He strides off. SOMEONE<Brad> and SOMEONE<Stu> share an exasperated look. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS185
00:32:06,00 --> 00:32:13,50
Later, SOMEONE's<Bostick's> two competitors sit at a table in an elegant restaurant. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS186
00:32:28,00 --> 00:32:33,50
The waiter heads off and SOMEONE<Stu> frowns. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS187
00:32:35,00 --> 00:32:40,50
SOMEONE<Stu> bulks at his girth. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS188
00:33:08,00 --> 00:33:12,50
The waiter returns. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS189
00:34:22,00 --> 00:34:28,50
SOMEONE's<Stu's> face remains blank as he sips his drink. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS190
00:34:25,00 --> 00:34:30,50
Lowering the glass, he nods. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS191
00:34:42,00 --> 00:34:47,50
SOMEONE<Stu> takes a long drink. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS192
00:34:54,00 --> 00:34:58,50
Later, they stroll outside. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS193
00:34:59,00 --> 00:35:06,50
SOMEONE<Stu> extends his hand to shake, but SOMEONE<Brad> leans forward and gives him a hug. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS194
00:35:07,00 --> 00:35:11,50
At a motel. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS195
00:35:31,00 --> 00:35:36,50
She discards a needle. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS196
00:35:46,00 --> 00:35:50,50
SOMEONE<Jess> smiles. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS197
00:35:47,00 --> 00:35:54,50
Now, in the deck of her boat, SOMEONE<Annie> stares through binoculars, then points. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS198
00:35:54,00 --> 00:36:05,50
May 8th, Coos Bay, Oregon. SOMEONE<Stu> writes his find in a daily journal, then notices a man with shaggy brown hair staring through binoculars. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS199
00:36:02,00 --> 00:36:07,50
He sets down his journal and walks over. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS200
00:36:06,00 --> 00:36:10,50
He nudges the guy. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS201
00:36:10,00 --> 00:36:21,50
Turning away from the stranger, SOMEONE<Stu> staggers briefly, then rests his hand against the ferry’s frame. His eyes widen and he stifles a gag. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS202
00:36:18,00 --> 00:36:26,50
As he rushes inside, leaving his belongings behind, Crane creeps over and picks up SOMEONE's<Stu's> journal. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS203
00:36:24,00 --> 00:36:29,50
He glances around, then flips through it. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS204
00:36:26,00 --> 00:36:36,50
Now, SOMEONE<Brad> sits in his cubicle at his otherwise vacant workplace and pulls up Crane's blog on his computer. He smiles as he reads. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS205
00:36:52,00 --> 00:36:57,50
SOMEONE<Brad> glares. Now SOMEONE<Stu> talks on the phone. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS206
00:37:32,00 --> 00:37:36,50
He checks his call waiting. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS207
00:37:43,00 --> 00:37:48,50
SOMEONE<Stu> switches to the other line. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS209
00:38:15,00 --> 00:38:21,50
Now, our view soars over jagged snowy mountains. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS210
00:38:42,00 --> 00:38:47,50
May 14th, Day 134. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS211
00:38:50,00 --> 00:38:54,50
SOMEONE<Brad> wears a T-shirt and boxers. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS213
00:39:33,00 --> 00:39:37,50
Now, they speed down a highway. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS214
00:39:44,00 --> 00:39:55,50
She swerves in front of a car. Meanwhile, a helicopter soars toward New York's towering skyscrapers. On a helipad, a man opens the door. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS215
00:40:17,00 --> 00:40:20,50
Later, in the meeting, 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS216
00:40:31,00 --> 00:40:36,50
SOMEONE<Stu> glares and SOMEONE<Barry> shoots SOMEONE<Jim> a look. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS217
00:40:50,00 --> 00:40:55,50
SOMEONE<Stu> gives a tight affirming smile. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS218
00:40:52,00 --> 00:40:57,50
SOMEONE<Barry> leans toward SOMEONE<Jim>. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS219
00:41:02,00 --> 00:41:06,50
He stands. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS220
00:41:13,00 --> 00:41:20,50
With sagging shoulders, SOMEONE<Stu> glances at his watch, then gives a resigned nod. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS221
00:41:18,00 --> 00:41:26,50
Later, he, SOMEONE<Barry> and SOMEONE<Jim> sit at the conference room table while McIntyre talks outside with his associates. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS222
00:41:24,00 --> 00:41:29,50
SOMEONE<Jim> shoots his watch a furtive glance. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS223
00:41:26,00 --> 00:41:31,50
McIntyre returns to the conference room. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS224
00:41:35,00 --> 00:41:39,50
He stands. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS225
00:41:38,00 --> 00:41:43,50
He talks on his cell as he exits the building. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS226
00:41:43,00 --> 00:41:51,50
He waits by the curb as his driver pulls the car up beside a row of taxis. He jumps in the back. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS227
00:41:51,00 --> 00:41:55,50
He checks the time. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS228
00:41:53,00 --> 00:41:58,50
Grimacing, he slumps against the seat. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS229
00:41:56,00 --> 00:42:02,50
Now, a small plane sits on a runway. Anchorage, Alaska. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS231
00:42:16,00 --> 00:42:25,50
As she turns away, SOMEONE<Bostick> eyes her new husband. He mouths Attu. What were you thinking? But the guy gives a dismissive wave. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS232
00:42:28,00 --> 00:42:32,50
SOMEONE<Brad> stumbles aboard. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS233
00:42:35,00 --> 00:42:40,50
He stows his bags on an overhead shelf. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS234
00:42:38,00 --> 00:42:46,50
He takes a seat across the aisle from SOMEONE<Bostick>, then notices the champion birder eyeing him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS235
00:42:45,00 --> 00:42:51,50
SOMEONE<Brad> allows a nod, then settles in his seat. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS236
00:42:49,00 --> 00:42:58,50
Now, the pilot pushes the plane's throttle and the craft begins to move. In the cabin, SOMEONE<Bostick> turns to SOMEONE<Brad>. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS237
00:43:19,00 --> 00:43:31,50
A taxi skids around the Merrill Airfield hangar, kicking up dust. SOMEONE<Stu> hurries out with his bags in hand. The plane turns onto a runway. On board, SOMEONE<Bostick> shrugs. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS238
00:43:32,00 --> 00:43:38,50
SOMEONE's<Bostick's> eyes widen. SOMEONE<Stu> runs for the plane. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS239
00:43:43,00 --> 00:43:48,50
He spies SOMEONE<Stu> through a window. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS240
00:43:53,00 --> 00:43:57,50
The plane lifts off the runway. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS241
00:43:57,00 --> 00:44:01,50
SOMEONE<Stu> drops his bags. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS242
00:43:59,00 --> 00:44:04,50
He doubles over defeatedly. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS243
00:44:15,00 --> 00:44:24,50
On a map, a red arrow extends from a point on the Alaskan coast to the Aleutian Islands halfway across the ocean. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS244
00:44:21,00 --> 00:44:28,50
As we descend toward the farthest one, real clouds blanket our view. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS245
00:44:27,00 --> 00:44:32,50
The plane bounces with turbulence. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS246
00:44:35,00 --> 00:44:40,50
The plane jostles violently. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS247
00:44:37,00 --> 00:44:42,50
Bags fall from the overhead shelves. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS248
00:44:44,00 --> 00:44:53,50
Shrieking hysterically, SOMEONE<Karen> grips the seat in front of her with both hands. The co-pilot glances back from the cockpit. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS249
00:44:50,00 --> 00:44:57,50
More luggage falls as the plane swoops through a range of jagged mountains. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS250
00:44:54,00 --> 00:45:02,50
SOMEONE<Brad> tensely looks across the aisle. Calmly nibbling a cookie, SOMEONE<Bostick> returns a cordial smile. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS251
00:45:00,00 --> 00:45:04,50
The plane lands roughly. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS252
00:45:02,00 --> 00:45:08,50
SOMEONE<Karen> sobs in her husband's arms while SOMEONE<Brad> sits frozen with a scowl. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS254
00:45:14,00 --> 00:45:22,50
Now, the birders march single file down a path cutting through a field at the base of a mountain. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS255
00:45:19,00 --> 00:45:26,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> hikes casually behind the newlyweds, admiring his surroundings. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS256
00:45:23,00 --> 00:45:29,50
SOMEONE's<Brad's> duffel bounces against his leg with each stride. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS257
00:45:27,00 --> 00:45:35,50
As the birders arrive at a remote compound, an old woman inside peers out a dingy window. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS258
00:45:34,00 --> 00:45:39,50
She sits and uses a PA microphone. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS259
00:45:41,00 --> 00:45:49,50
Now, a pair of doors slides open revealing the inside of a Quonset hut set with two rows of bunk beds. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS260
00:45:47,00 --> 00:45:54,50
SOMEONE's<Karen's> husband takes in the crude quarters with a grin, barely registering her glum pout. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS261
00:45:52,00 --> 00:45:56,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> steps up behind them. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS262
00:46:05,00 --> 00:46:11,50
He strolls pass the bunks, then moves through a humble dining area. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS263
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:17,50
A seated woman high fives him as he passes. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS264
00:46:15,00 --> 00:46:22,50
Reaching the room's far wall, he shoves a row of lockers to one side revealing a hidden door. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS265
00:46:20,00 --> 00:46:26,50
He opens it with a cocky smirk to reveal a small private room. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS266
00:46:23,00 --> 00:46:28,50
The others stare as he sets down his things. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS267
00:46:30,00 --> 00:46:37,50
Opening a small chest filled with personal items, he takes out a pair of green drawstring pants. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS268
00:46:41,00 --> 00:46:47,50
In the common sleeping area, SOMEONE<Brad> sets his bags on a lower bunk. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS269
00:46:49,00 --> 00:46:54,50
A rat runs along a shelf by the headboard. SOMEONE<Brad> springs up and hits his head on the top bunk. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS270
00:46:53,00 --> 00:46:58,50
He scrambles wildly off the bed, grabbing his duffel and peers after the rat with a fearful stare. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS272
00:47:08,00 --> 00:47:13,50
He sees the pretty brunette chatting with a tall guy. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS273
00:47:11,00 --> 00:47:15,50
SOMEONE<Brad> approaches her. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS274
00:47:15,00 --> 00:47:27,50
The pretty brunette swings her legs around obliviously kicking him in the face. Recovering, he dances from foot to foot as he tries to find a path to his bunk while the other birders rush past him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS275
00:47:27,00 --> 00:47:32,50
Outside, they climb on bikes and ride off. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS276
00:47:37,00 --> 00:47:44,50
Munching cereal, SOMEONE<Bostick> lounges in the dining area in his green drawstring pants. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS277
00:47:41,00 --> 00:47:48,50
SOMEONE<Brad> narrows his eyes at him, then rushes out to find the other birders riding off. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS278
00:47:45,00 --> 00:47:53,50
Donning a knit hat, he grabs one of the few remaining bikes and awkwardly peddles after them. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS279
00:47:52,00 --> 00:47:57,50
Now, on a rugged gravel trail. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS280
00:48:00,00 --> 00:48:04,50
The birders turn. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS282
00:48:17,00 --> 00:48:23,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> stretches as he strolls outside in his green pants. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS283
00:48:31,00 --> 00:48:39,50
Wildlife footage shows a sea bird landing among some penguin stealing their fish and flying off. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS284
00:48:36,00 --> 00:48:45,50
Now, the birders use binoculars to scan a snowy field near the base of a mountain. SOMEONE<Brad> squints in the sunlight. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS285
00:48:47,00 --> 00:48:53,50
As he turns hurriedly, his feet slip out from under him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS286
00:48:50,00 --> 00:48:56,50
He lands on his back in the snow as his fellow birders rush past him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS288
00:48:55,00 --> 00:49:00,50
He peers through his binoculars like the others. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS289
00:48:57,00 --> 00:49:04,50
A small flock of birds takes flight, but one lingers behind. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS290
00:49:01,00 --> 00:49:07,50
It languidly flutters toward a ridge where SOMEONE<Bostick> photographs it. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS291
00:49:04,00 --> 00:49:09,50
The others lower their binoculars. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS292
00:49:08,00 --> 00:49:14,50
As he moves on, his tally ticks up to 537. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS293
00:49:13,00 --> 00:49:39,50
SOMEONE's<Brad's> tally ticks up to 534. As the birders ride across the mountain valley, hand scrolled bird names appear all around them pointed out by arrows: semipalmated plover, spectacled eider, olive-backed pipit, bean goose, Eurasian widgeon, rock ptarmigan, bufflehead, Arctic loon, Laysan albatross. SOMEONE<Brad> grimaces with effort as he tries to keep up with the others. They spot more birds in a field in a canyon. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS294
00:49:36,00 --> 00:49:46,50
Bar-tailed godwit, hoary redpoll, Lapland longspur, Northern shovelers, spectacled eider, long-toed stint. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS295
00:49:43,00 --> 00:49:55,50
Carrying their bikes, they wade across a gentle river. Atop a high ridge, SOMEONE<Brad> gazes through his binoculars. SOMEONE<Bostick> rides alone through a meadow past one last arrowed label - smew. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS296
00:49:53,00 --> 00:49:58,50
Now, storm clouds swirl over the compound. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS297
00:50:01,00 --> 00:50:06,50
The rat creeps on to SOMEONE's<Brad's> pillow. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS298
00:50:07,00 --> 00:50:13,50
At the Alaska Breeze motel, SOMEONE<Stu> rolls his eyes. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS299
00:50:35,00 --> 00:50:41,50
Now, on Attu, SOMEONE<Brad> rides his bike over a ridge. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS300
00:50:41,00 --> 00:50:48,50
Arriving at the compound, he climbs off, walks his bike to a rack and leaves it there. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS301
00:50:46,00 --> 00:50:53,50
He picks up his knees as he walks to the building, cooling down his stubby legs. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS302
00:50:50,00 --> 00:50:55,50
Going in, he sets down his binoculars. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS303
00:50:53,00 --> 00:51:01,50
He starts to remove his jacket, then notices the pretty brunette in the dining area and heads toward her. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS304
00:51:09,00 --> 00:51:15,50
Wrenching his jacket back on, he brushes past the older man. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS305
00:51:12,00 --> 00:51:20,50
SOMEONE<Stu> stares after him, then presses his lips together knowingly and follows him out. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS306
00:51:17,00 --> 00:51:21,50
SOMEONE<Brad> walks a bike toward a path. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS307
00:51:34,00 --> 00:51:39,50
Passing by, the tall brawny birder eyes them curiously. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS308
00:52:37,00 --> 00:52:45,50
Later, low clouds roll over the compound. A freak blizzard bombards the area with driving snow. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS309
00:52:43,00 --> 00:52:52,50
A tiny bird shifts its nervous gaze. A bald eagle bares the storm stoically, its feathers ruffled in the wind. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS310
00:52:49,00 --> 00:52:53,50
They stand at an icy window. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS312
00:53:58,00 --> 00:54:03,50
Now, SOMEONE<Bostick> sips brandy and tells stories. SOMEONE<Stu> regards him with a distrustful gaze. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS313
00:54:03,00 --> 00:54:08,50
Now, SOMEONE<Brad> hikes across the rugged snowy landscape. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS315
00:54:06,00 --> 00:54:11,50
He raises his binoculars to his eyes. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS316
00:54:09,00 --> 00:54:13,50
SOMEONE<Stu> and SOMEONE<Bostick> catch up to him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS317
00:54:29,00 --> 00:54:36,50
The two birds clasp each other’s talons, then cartwheel as they plummet from the sky. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS318
00:54:47,00 --> 00:54:51,50
SOMEONE<Stu> turns and heads off. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS319
00:54:51,00 --> 00:54:57,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> follows him, but SOMEONE<Brad> lingers behind to watch the eagles. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS320
00:54:55,00 --> 00:55:01,50
He lowers his binoculars with a pensive frown. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS321
00:55:00,00 --> 00:55:07,50
Now, in the Quonset hut, the pretty brunette lies on her upper bunk typing on her laptop. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS322
00:55:05,00 --> 00:55:11,50
From a table in the dining area, SOMEONE<Brad> watches her longingly. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS323
00:55:08,00 --> 00:55:14,50
He turns away, then gives a brave nod and gets to his feet. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS324
00:55:12,00 --> 00:55:18,50
Stuffing his hands in his pockets, he shuffles toward her bunk. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS325
00:56:58,00 --> 00:57:08,50
Now, SOMEONE<Stu> leaves an outhouse with a bird shaped hole carved in its wooden door. Taking in his snow-blanketed surroundings, he finds SOMEONE<Brad> pumping up a bicycle tire. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS326
00:57:12,00 --> 00:57:16,50
SOMEONE<Stu> rolls his eyes. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS327
00:57:15,00 --> 00:57:19,50
He pats SOMEONE's<Brad's> shoulder. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS328
00:57:27,00 --> 00:57:32,50
Inside, a knife cuts fish. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS329
00:57:39,00 --> 00:57:43,50
He wipes the counter with a scarf. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS330
00:57:54,00 --> 00:57:59,50
SOMEONE<Karen> storms outside with it. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS331
00:57:58,00 --> 00:58:07,50
The birders flock to the windows. As SOMEONE<Karen> takes her scarf to a water pump, gulls swoop down all around her. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS332
00:58:04,00 --> 00:58:10,50
She flails wildly in a futile attempt to defend herself. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS333
00:58:12,00 --> 00:58:17,50
Her husband rushes out and flings the scarf aside. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS334
00:58:16,00 --> 00:58:21,50
She falls on her behind as the birds continue their assault. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS335
00:58:21,00 --> 00:58:29,50
Now, as the birders file toward a waiting air taxi, SOMEONE<Karen> storms past them with her expensive luggage. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS336
00:58:26,00 --> 00:58:32,50
One guy looks back and points to a rooftop. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS337
00:58:31,00 --> 00:58:36,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> takes down a windsock. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS342
00:58:46,00 --> 00:58:51,50
He replaces the windsock with his green pants. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS343
00:59:15,00 --> 00:59:20,50
SOMEONE<Brad> boards the plane. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS344
00:59:18,00 --> 00:59:25,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> climbs on as well. Staying behind, SOMEONE<Stu> jogs away joyfully. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS345
00:59:22,00 --> 00:59:28,50
Beneath the cloudy sky, the plane lifts off from the runway. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS346
00:59:26,00 --> 00:59:32,50
On board, SOMEONE<Ellie> reaches across the aisle and taps SOMEONE's<Brad's> shoulder. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS347
00:59:31,00 --> 00:59:40,50
As he turns, she hands him a slip of paper. He reads it, lifts his brow and glances back at her with a hopeful smile. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS348
00:59:45,00 --> 00:59:50,50
A series of scenes highlights his travels. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS349
00:59:55,00 --> 01:00:08,50
SOMEONE<Brad> hikes up to a waterfall where a bird soars among the mist. In a city, SOMEONE<Ellie> uses her cell phone as she peers upward through binoculars. On the other end of the line, SOMEONE<Brad> strolls through a desert. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS350
01:00:06,00 --> 01:00:11,50
Now, a fan boat speeds through the Everglades. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS351
01:00:08,00 --> 01:00:15,50
In a swamp, SOMEONE<Brad> fights his way past a low branch as he rows a small boat. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS352
01:00:13,00 --> 01:00:17,50
He spies a flamingo ahead. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS353
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:21,50
At sunset, he watches circling gulls from a sand bar. Now, at work. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS354
01:00:21,00 --> 01:00:25,50
SOMEONE<Brad> answers his cell. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS355
01:00:33,00 --> 01:00:42,50
Now, words appear beneath the speeding train. August 20th, Day 232. SOMEONE<Brad> arrives at Boston South Station. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS356
01:00:47,00 --> 01:00:51,50
He spies SOMEONE<Ellie> on the platform. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS357
01:00:53,00 --> 01:00:57,50
He disembarks. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS358
01:00:55,00 --> 01:00:59,50
He shyly pecks her cheek. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS359
01:01:23,00 --> 01:01:28,50
They leave the station and approach a car at the curb. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS360
01:02:15,00 --> 01:02:20,50
With a thoughtful look, SOMEONE<Stu> lowers his phone. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS361
01:02:26,00 --> 01:02:31,50
His son answers the door to an apartment. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS362
01:02:28,00 --> 01:02:33,50
Stepping inside, SOMEONE<Stu> hugs him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS363
01:02:35,00 --> 01:02:40,50
His daughter-in-law cradles her infant son. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS364
01:02:50,00 --> 01:02:55,50
The white haired grandfather gives a touched look. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS365
01:03:00,00 --> 01:03:03,50
He sits. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS366
01:03:01,00 --> 01:03:05,50
He reaches out. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS367
01:03:04,00 --> 01:03:08,50
His son snaps photos. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS368
01:03:16,00 --> 01:03:21,50
He gives his grandson a broad goofy grin. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS369
01:03:21,00 --> 01:03:25,50
SOMEONE<Edith> arrives. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS370
01:03:25,00 --> 01:03:30,50
She watches lovingly from the background. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS371
01:03:27,00 --> 01:03:32,50
SOMEONE<Stu> notices her and smiles. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS372
01:03:38,00 --> 01:03:44,50
He jiggles little SOMEONE's<Stu's> hips like a dancer. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS373
01:03:42,00 --> 01:03:47,50
Later, he hurries outside. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS374
01:03:44,00 --> 01:03:48,50
A cab pulls to a stop. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS375
01:03:46,00 --> 01:03:54,50
He loads his bags into the backseat, then turns to his son's apartment and waves good-bye. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS376
01:03:51,00 --> 01:03:56,50
His family waves back from a window. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS377
01:04:11,00 --> 01:04:15,50
SOMEONE<Stu> strolls through an Iowa field. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS378
01:04:14,00 --> 01:04:19,50
He stands on a beach in Fire Island. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS379
01:04:19,00 --> 01:04:25,50
Sitting in an airport shuttle, he eyes his phone. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS380
01:04:25,00 --> 01:04:31,50
Its display shows the photos of a smiling SOMEONE<Stu> holding his grandson. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS381
01:04:32,00 --> 01:04:37,50
October 2nd. Seattle, Washington. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS382
01:04:37,00 --> 01:04:43,50
SOMEONE<Brad> grins as he sees SOMEONE<Stu> at the ferry terminal. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS383
01:04:58,00 --> 01:05:03,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> approaches with a hand cupped to his ear. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS384
01:05:27,00 --> 01:05:31,50
He leaves. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS385
01:05:38,00 --> 01:05:44,50
Seeing SOMEONE<Bostick> sprint to his car, they head to the ticket booth. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS386
01:05:50,00 --> 01:05:58,50
Pulling his car out of a line of vehicles waiting for the ferry, SOMEONE<Bostick> peels off down the road. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS387
01:05:56,00 --> 01:06:02,50
SOMEONE<Stu> and SOMEONE<Brad> jump into a gray sedan at the front of the line. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS388
01:05:59,00 --> 01:06:06,50
The white haired birder turns his vehicle around and heads after SOMEONE<Bostick>. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS389
01:06:03,00 --> 01:06:13,50
As the gray sedan speeds off down the road, SOMEONE's<Bostick's> blue car glides back out from behind a bus and returns to its spot in the ferry line. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS390
01:06:10,00 --> 01:06:15,50
The champion birder casually gets out. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS391
01:06:15,00 --> 01:06:22,50
Glancing over his shoulder, he smirks. Now, at the Skagit Wildlife area. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS392
01:06:27,00 --> 01:06:31,50
SOMEONE<Brad> checks his watch. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS393
01:07:12,00 --> 01:07:16,50
SOMEONE<Stu> nods. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS394
01:07:16,00 --> 01:07:22,50
He looks away, then furrows his brow and turns back to SOMEONE<Brad>. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS395
01:07:21,00 --> 01:07:26,50
SOMEONE<Brad> opens his arms affirmatively. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS396
01:07:27,00 --> 01:07:35,50
Now, he consults a map as SOMEONE<Stu> drives. Later, they paddle a canoe down a stream in Whitefish, Montana. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS397
01:07:37,00 --> 01:07:46,50
Now, a car rolls down a dusty road between Rocky Mountains. Later, SOMEONE<Stu> peers through bushes at water birds. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS398
01:07:43,00 --> 01:07:51,50
Holding him on his shoulders, SOMEONE<Brad> grimaces. Asheville, North Carolina. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS399
01:07:48,00 --> 01:07:54,50
A wider view shows an industrial plant beyond the bushes. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS400
01:07:51,00 --> 01:07:57,50
SOMEONE<Stu> stumbles as SOMEONE<Brad> tries to climb onto his shoulders. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS401
01:07:54,00 --> 01:08:00,50
Now, in the car, SOMEONE<Brad> claps and SOMEONE<Stu> sings. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS402
01:07:58,00 --> 01:08:04,50
Later, they sit at the edge of Lake Tahoe in Nevada. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS403
01:08:07,00 --> 01:08:11,50
SOMEONE<Brad> hurries off. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS404
01:08:09,00 --> 01:08:13,50
At a bar, SOMEONE<Stu> talks on his phone. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS405
01:08:13,00 --> 01:08:18,50
He hangs up, then turns to SOMEONE<Brad>. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS406
01:08:30,00 --> 01:08:36,50
Now, a helicopter swoops between jagged peaks. Words appear. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS407
01:08:33,00 --> 01:08:38,50
SOMEONE<Ruby> Mountains, Nevada. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS408
01:08:41,00 --> 01:08:48,50
Sitting beside SOMEONE<Gil>, the pilot, SOMEONE<Brad> shifts his eyes to the jagged rocks. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS409
01:08:51,00 --> 01:09:00,50
The chopper banks suddenly toward a mountain face, then swerves away at the last second. SOMEONE<Stu> squeezes his eyes shut. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS410
01:08:57,00 --> 01:09:01,50
SOMEONE<Gil> cackles. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS411
01:09:01,00 --> 01:09:09,50
SOMEONE<Brad> clutches his grab handle. The pilot spots a pale bird dipping below a tree-lined cliff. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS412
01:09:13,00 --> 01:09:21,50
The helicopter swings back around with its nose pointed downwards. SOMEONE<Brad> cringes. SOMEONE<Stu> wears a queasy look. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS413
01:09:23,00 --> 01:09:28,50
SOMEONE<Gil> spots the snow cock. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS414
01:09:33,00 --> 01:09:42,50
The bird nosedives, leaving the chopper headed straight toward a cliff face. The pilot swerves away just in time. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS415
01:09:47,00 --> 01:09:54,50
Now, the chopper lands in front of a hangar reading Nevada Aviation. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS416
01:09:51,00 --> 01:09:59,50
Crouched to avoid the aircraft's spinning blades, SOMEONE<Brad> and SOMEONE<Stu> climb out and hurry to a safe distance. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS417
01:10:00,00 --> 01:10:05,50
SOMEONE<Brad> jumps up and pumps his fists. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS418
01:10:05,00 --> 01:10:12,50
SOMEONE<Brad> kisses the ground. SOMEONE<Stu> does a wild and crazy version of the twist. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS419
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:15,50
SOMEONE<Brad> dances with him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS420
01:10:17,00 --> 01:10:23,50
SOMEONE<Stu> stops his disco dancing as he sees SOMEONE's<Brad's> frown. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS421
01:10:21,00 --> 01:10:27,50
Now, at a hospital, his mother buttons his father's shirt. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS422
01:10:27,00 --> 01:10:31,50
SOMEONE<Brad> watches worriedly. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS423
01:10:45,00 --> 01:10:51,50
Sitting on the edge of the hospital bed, he shoots his son a weary glance. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS424
01:10:48,00 --> 01:10:55,50
SOMEONE<Brad> scrutinizes him, then walks to his bag which rests on a chair. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS425
01:10:55,00 --> 01:10:59,50
He grabs a camera. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS426
01:10:58,00 --> 01:11:04,50
His dad takes a pair of glasses from his breast pocket. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS427
01:11:13,00 --> 01:11:17,50
He clicks to the next image. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS428
01:12:14,00 --> 01:12:19,50
He smiles as he gazes at the photo. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS429
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:21,50
His father gives him a thoughtful look. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS430
01:12:19,00 --> 01:12:24,50
Now, a car screeches to a halt on a dusty road. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS431
01:12:21,00 --> 01:12:27,50
Santa Fe National Forest, New Mexico. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS432
01:12:24,00 --> 01:12:30,50
SOMEONE<Stu> drinks from a canteen as he waits on a rocky mountainside. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS433
01:12:31,00 --> 01:12:35,50
He hurries after the sound. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS434
01:12:32,00 --> 01:12:38,50
Elsewhere, a portly man makes birdcalls. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS435
01:12:38,00 --> 01:12:42,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> hurries over. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS436
01:12:57,00 --> 01:13:01,50
SOMEONE<Stu> eavesdrops. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS437
01:13:49,00 --> 01:13:53,50
He hurries ahead. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS438
01:13:53,00 --> 01:14:03,50
Now, at Bergen Fertility Clinic, SOMEONE<Jess> reads through paperwork on a clipboard, then brings it to a reception desk where a dark haired nurse takes it. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS439
01:14:08,00 --> 01:14:14,50
She flashes a smile, then returns to her seat in the waiting room. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS440
01:14:12,00 --> 01:14:18,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Bostick> races to his car in the airport parking lot. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS441
01:14:15,00 --> 01:14:21,50
He stows his bags in the trunk, then climbs in. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS442
01:14:19,00 --> 01:14:25,50
As he starts the engine, his wipers clear a layer of dirt off the windshield. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS443
01:14:25,00 --> 01:14:32,50
In an exam room at the clinic, the dark haired nurse draws his wife's blood. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS444
01:14:29,00 --> 01:14:33,50
SOMEONE<Jess> winces. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS445
01:14:41,00 --> 01:14:46,50
She looks away, her smile fading. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS446
01:14:43,00 --> 01:14:49,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE<Bostick> stops at a parking attendant's booth. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS447
01:14:50,00 --> 01:14:57,50
The cashier takes his ticket and the gate's striped arm lifts allowing SOMEONE<Bostick> car to leave the lot. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS448
01:14:55,00 --> 01:14:59,50
The blonde birder speeds away from the airport. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS450
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:04,50
He swerves from lane to lane, passing other cars. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS451
01:15:05,00 --> 01:15:12,50
At the clinic, SOMEONE<Jess> now wears a hospital gown as she waits alone in an exam chair. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS452
01:15:09,00 --> 01:15:15,50
She extends her legs and anxiously flexes her feet. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS453
01:15:13,00 --> 01:15:16,50
As the door opens, 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS454
01:15:14,00 --> 01:15:18,50
she sets her feet down with a start. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS455
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:28,50
The nurse backs out of the room. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS456
01:15:27,00 --> 01:15:32,50
SOMEONE<Jess> drops her face in her hand. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS457
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:39,50
Speeding into the clinic's lot, her husband parks crookedly in a space. He races toward the entrance. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS458
01:15:39,00 --> 01:15:46,50
He takes out his cell and checks its display, then answers with one hand on the clinic’s door. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS459
01:15:57,00 --> 01:16:01,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> checks the time. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS461
01:16:00,00 --> 01:16:04,50
In the clinic, SOMEONE<Jess> makes a call. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS462
01:16:14,00 --> 01:16:20,50
He takes a parking ticket as he heads back into the airport lot. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS463
01:16:20,00 --> 01:16:24,50
Later, at their house. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS464
01:16:23,00 --> 01:16:30,50
Running her hands through her hair, SOMEONE<Jess> sits heavily on a box in a partially renovated room. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS465
01:16:28,00 --> 01:16:35,50
Pastel wallpaper with children's drawings covers the bottom half of the walls. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS466
01:16:32,00 --> 01:16:38,50
As SOMEONE<Jess> rests her head in her hands, SOMEONE<Frank> Jr. tiptoes in. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS467
01:16:40,00 --> 01:16:44,50
He holds out a mug. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS468
01:16:45,00 --> 01:16:49,50
He sets it on a table. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS469
01:16:50,00 --> 01:16:53,50
He leaves. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS470
01:16:51,00 --> 01:16:57,50
Meanwhile at the SOMEONE<Harris> house, SOMEONE's<Brad's> father reads in the living room. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS471
01:16:59,00 --> 01:17:07,50
With an exasperated look, he sets his newspaper aside and grabs his son's backpack off the floor. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS472
01:17:05,00 --> 01:17:13,50
He opens its front pocket and rifles through it, taking out packages of snacks and setting them on a coffee table. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS473
01:17:11,00 --> 01:17:15,50
Finding SOMEONE's<Brad's> phone, he answers. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS474
01:17:46,00 --> 01:17:51,50
SOMEONE<Brad> comes downstairs. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS475
01:17:56,00 --> 01:18:02,50
Now, light snow falls as SOMEONE<Brad> and his father walk in the woods. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS476
01:18:00,00 --> 01:18:05,50
SOMEONE<George> Washington National Forest, Virginia. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS477
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:36,50
Now, autumn leaves add rich color to SOMEONE's<Bostick's> street as he gets out of his car. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS478
01:18:34,00 --> 01:18:39,50
He goes to the trunk and takes out his bags. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS479
01:18:36,00 --> 01:18:42,50
His vanity license plate reads 732. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS481
01:18:43,00 --> 01:18:48,50
The champion birder enters his now fully renovated home. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS484
01:18:54,00 --> 01:19:01,50
He goes to a nearby room and sets down his green Jet's duffel bag on a table. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS485
01:18:59,00 --> 01:19:04,50
He proceeds into a dining area, plants his hands on his hips and looks around. SOMEONE<Bostick> jogs upstairs and strolls along the landing. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS488
01:19:08,00 --> 01:19:12,50
Arriving at the door, he leans a hand against the frame and peers in.  

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS489
01:19:11,00 --> 01:19:16,50
Frowning, he heads down the hall. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS490
01:19:15,00 --> 01:19:18,50
He arrives in the bedroom and glares at his wife.  

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS491
01:19:16,00 --> 01:19:19,50
Under the covers, she stares up at him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS492
01:19:17,00 --> 01:19:22,50
He steps away and she rolls onto her back. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS493
01:19:20,00 --> 01:19:26,50
Now, SOMEONE<Bostick> sits gazing ahead with a heart broken scowl. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS494
01:19:23,00 --> 01:19:28,50
In a short nightie and open bathrobe, 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS495
01:19:25,00 --> 01:19:30,50
SOMEONE<Jess> pads downstairs. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS497
01:19:29,00 --> 01:19:33,50
She sits on the lower steps, regarding him with a gentle expression. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS498
01:19:49,00 --> 01:19:53,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> briefly lowers his gaze. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS500
01:20:10,00 --> 01:20:14,50
Her arms folded, SOMEONE<Jess> moves closer to her husband, then takes a seat facing him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS502
01:20:24,00 --> 01:20:27,50
She hurries away. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS503
01:20:25,00 --> 01:20:30,50
In the forest, the snow falls more heavily. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS504
01:20:29,00 --> 01:20:36,50
SOMEONE's<Brad's> father stoops warily as he follows his son through the woods. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS505
01:20:35,00 --> 01:20:40,50
SOMEONE<Brad> surveys the trees as he gives birdcalls. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS506
01:20:40,00 --> 01:20:45,50
He notices his father wincing. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS507
01:20:43,00 --> 01:20:48,50
He lays a hand on SOMEONE's<Brad's> shoulder. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS508
01:20:46,00 --> 01:20:55,50
The younger man regards his father with a concerned frown, then proceeds onward at the gentle snowfall. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS509
01:20:52,00 --> 01:20:57,50
An oxygen tank peeking from his backpack. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS510
01:20:55,00 --> 01:20:59,50
As their paths take them uphill, 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS512
01:21:01,00 --> 01:21:06,50
his father slows to a stop. His son faces him boyishly. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS513
01:21:14,00 --> 01:21:20,50
SOMEONE<Brad> rolls his eyes, then brings the tank over. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS514
01:21:23,00 --> 01:21:28,50
Obeying, SOMEONE<Brad> glances back at his father. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS515
01:21:26,00 --> 01:21:31,50
The ailing old man opens the backpack. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS516
01:21:28,00 --> 01:21:32,50
With the SOMEONE's<Bostick's>. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS517
01:22:34,00 --> 01:22:38,50
SOMEONE's<Jess's> eyes gleam meaningfully. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS518
01:22:36,00 --> 01:22:40,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> lowers his gaze. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS519
01:22:38,00 --> 01:22:43,50
The two stand apart on opposite sides of the kitchen. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS521
01:22:47,00 --> 01:22:55,50
Now, in the forest. In the gentle snowfall, SOMEONE<Brad> raises his binoculars and peers through them at the surrounding trees. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS522
01:22:53,00 --> 01:22:57,50
He lowers them and ventures on. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS523
01:22:56,00 --> 01:23:01,50
Later, he hikes up a path in the darkening woods. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS524
01:22:59,00 --> 01:23:05,50
He halts abruptly, his gaze suddenly worried. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS525
01:23:07,00 --> 01:23:26,50
He hurriedly doubles back. Silhouetted against the snowy woods, he runs back to where he left his father. Looking around, he finds no sign of him. SOMEONE's<Brad's> expression grows frantic and he rushes further down the path. He stops periodically to scan the area for his father, then plunges onward. SOMEONE's<Brad's> searching eyes glisten. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS526
01:23:34,00 --> 01:23:52,50
His brow furrows fearfully and he races wildly through the darkening wintry forest. Dashing down a ridge, he peers through the snow and finds his father about 20 yards ahead. The old man stoops and sways on his feet. SOMEONE<Brad> relieved smile fades and he hurries over to his ailing father. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS527
01:23:52,00 --> 01:23:59,50
With one hand braced against the tree, his father points upward happily. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS528
01:23:56,00 --> 01:24:05,50
Following his gaze, SOMEONE<Brad> finds a magnificent dark brown owl perched almost directly overhead. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS529
01:24:02,00 --> 01:24:08,50
His beaming father claps an arm around him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS530
01:24:10,00 --> 01:24:15,50
It gazes down at them serenely. Daytime. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS531
01:24:13,00 --> 01:24:19,50
At home, SOMEONE<Brad> groggily rolls over on his bed and answers his cell phone. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS532
01:24:19,00 --> 01:24:24,50
Rio Chama River, New Mexico. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS533
01:24:28,00 --> 01:24:37,50
Now, as SOMEONE<Brad> and SOMEONE<Stu> run along the rainy dock, words appear. November 27th, Day 331. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS534
01:24:35,00 --> 01:24:43,50
They spy a sign printed on turkey-themed stationary - No Birding Today. Happy Holidays. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS535
01:24:44,00 --> 01:24:48,50
Now, in a car. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS536
01:25:06,00 --> 01:25:11,50
Now, SOMEONE<Annie> opens a door with a wreath on it. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS537
01:25:14,00 --> 01:25:19,50
She slams the door in their faces. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS538
01:25:17,00 --> 01:25:23,50
As the two friends start to leave the porch, the door flies open behind them. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS539
01:25:24,00 --> 01:25:29,50
SOMEONE<Brad> and SOMEONE<Stu> nod. Now, on SOMEONE's<Annie's> boat. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS540
01:25:38,00 --> 01:25:46,50
Monterrey, California. On a beach, Crane watches SOMEONE<Bostick>. Later, SOMEONE<Brad> reads his blog. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS541
01:25:50,00 --> 01:25:55,50
SOMEONE<Brad> uses his cell phone. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS542
01:26:13,00 --> 01:26:21,50
Now, as SOMEONE<Bostick> drives in a snowstorm, words appear. December 24th. Duluth, Minnesota. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS543
01:26:18,00 --> 01:26:26,50
He mumbles silently to himself, then peers out his windshield and shifts his pensive gaze. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS544
01:26:24,00 --> 01:26:31,50
Now, in a Chinese restaurant, he struggles with his chopsticks. A waiter brings a fork. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS545
01:26:33,00 --> 01:26:37,50
The waiter starts to step away. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS546
01:26:44,00 --> 01:26:48,50
Later, two waiters eat with him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS547
01:26:48,00 --> 01:26:52,50
Chewing, SOMEONE<Bostick> shifts his gaze. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS548
01:26:59,00 --> 01:27:05,50
SOMEONE<Chan> questions his female colleague who shrugs. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS549
01:27:17,00 --> 01:27:23,50
Through a window, we watch SOMEONE<Bostick> raise his teacup to his companions. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS551
01:27:21,00 --> 01:27:30,50
At home, SOMEONE<Stu> strides briefly from his office. Words appear, December 29th, Day 363. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS552
01:27:27,00 --> 01:27:33,50
SOMEONE<Stu> returns to his office and answers the phone. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS553
01:28:07,00 --> 01:28:13,50
SOMEONE<Barry> mouths nice to Jim, who shrugs. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS554
01:28:10,00 --> 01:28:16,50
Through a window, SOMEONE<Stu> tenderly watches SOMEONE<Edith> approach the house. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS555
01:28:17,00 --> 01:28:22,50
The two cronies pump their fists. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS556
01:28:43,00 --> 01:28:48,50
December 30th, in the mountains. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS557
01:29:06,00 --> 01:29:11,50
SOMEONE<Stu> leads his friend up a snowy path. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS558
01:29:14,00 --> 01:29:19,50
They proceed over a high ridge. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS559
01:29:16,00 --> 01:29:22,50
SOMEONE<Stu> taps SOMEONE's<Brad's> shoulder and points. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS560
01:29:23,00 --> 01:29:29,50
They stop at the crest of a snowy hill and use their binoculars. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS561
01:29:32,00 --> 01:29:37,50
A goose bathes in a hot spring. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS562
01:29:38,00 --> 01:29:43,50
SOMEONE<Stu> lowers his binoculars and faces him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS563
01:29:44,00 --> 01:29:49,50
SOMEONE<Brad> grins and lifts his arms triumphantly. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS564
01:29:47,00 --> 01:29:51,50
SOMEONE<Stu> hugs him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS565
01:29:49,00 --> 01:29:56,50
He arcs away. The rare goose stands on a rock. Its pink feet exposed. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS566
01:29:54,00 --> 01:30:00,50
Now, outside a rustic lodge, a camera flashes in the nearby woods. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS567
01:30:01,00 --> 01:30:07,50
SOMEONE<Bostick> emerges from the forest and passes the lodge. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS568
01:30:04,00 --> 01:30:12,50
As he scribbles in a notebook, words write out below. December 31st. Snowy owl. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS569
01:30:10,00 --> 01:30:17,50
He glances back at people embracing each other at the lodge's porch, then ventures onward. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS570
01:30:15,00 --> 01:30:21,50
At SOMEONE's<Stu's> house, snow frosts the branches of the surrounding trees. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS571
01:30:19,00 --> 01:30:27,50
Inside, the retired businessman clinks glasses with his son, his arm around his wife. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS572
01:30:24,00 --> 01:30:30,50
Now, a TV shows the Time Square celebration. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS573
01:30:27,00 --> 01:30:33,50
Our view sweeps around, revealing SOMEONE's<Brad's> parents' living room. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS574
01:30:31,00 --> 01:30:37,50
The older couple dozes on the couch while SOMEONE<Brad> sits in a chair next to them. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS575
01:30:42,00 --> 01:30:48,50
He gets up and steps away from his sleeping parents as he answers his cell phone. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS576
01:31:08,00 --> 01:31:15,50
Lowering the phone, SOMEONE<Brad> dances victoriously on his parents' back porch. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS577
01:31:16,00 --> 01:31:20,50
He allows a joyful grin. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS578
01:31:28,00 --> 01:31:36,50
Our view drifts up to the sky and finds two large birds flying in silhouette against the full moon. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS579
01:31:33,00 --> 01:31:43,50
Daytime. A mail truck pulls away from SOMEONE's<Stu's> house. SOMEONE<Stu> comes out through the automatically opening gates and collects the bundled delivery. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS580
01:31:41,00 --> 01:31:47,50
He pulls off a rubber band and sorts through it on his way back to the house. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS581
01:31:44,00 --> 01:31:51,50
SOMEONE<Stu> slows to a stop as he comes to a magazine titled Birding. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS582
01:31:48,00 --> 01:31:55,50
A banner across one corner reads Big Year results, page 46. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS584
01:32:44,00 --> 01:32:48,50
SOMEONE<Brad> faces SOMEONE<Ellie>. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS585
01:32:52,00 --> 01:32:57,50
SOMEONE<Stu> tenderly faces his wife who smiles back at him. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS586
01:33:07,00 --> 01:33:11,50
SOMEONE<Brad> approaches SOMEONE<Ellie>. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS587
01:33:17,00 --> 01:33:25,50
SOMEONE<Ellie> joyfully runs to him. SOMEONE<Brad> scoops her up in his arms and spins her around in a warm embrace. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS588
01:33:22,00 --> 01:33:29,50
At SOMEONE's,<Stu's,> SOMEONE<Edith> joins her husband at a window and rests her chin on his shoulder. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS589
01:33:31,00 --> 01:33:35,50
They both smile. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS590
01:33:40,00 --> 01:33:46,50
Now, SOMEONE<Stu> walks outdoors carrying a toddler. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS591
01:33:58,00 --> 01:34:02,50
Little SOMEONE<Stu> smiles. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS592
01:34:04,00 --> 01:34:13,50
He stands at a round doorway overlooking a beautiful landscape. His thoughtful gaze focused on a happy couple with a baby. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS593
01:34:17,00 --> 01:34:23,50
SOMEONE<Brad> and SOMEONE<Ellie> arrive at the edge of a rocky coast. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS594
01:34:24,00 --> 01:34:28,50
Through binoculars, we watch gulls. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS595
01:34:32,00 --> 01:34:40,50
Lowering his binoculars, SOMEONE<Brad> regards SOMEONE<Ellie> affectionately as she happily watches the birds. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS597
01:34:38,00 --> 01:34:48,50
Words appear. To set the Big Year record, Kenny SOMEONE<Bostick> saw 755 different species of birds including hummingbirds. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS598
01:34:45,00 --> 01:34:51,50
A handwritten label accompanies snapshots of the tiny birds. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS599
01:34:48,00 --> 01:34:53,50
More photos show auklets. 

THE_BIG_YEAR_DVS600
01:34:50,00 --> 01:34:57,50
Images of woodpeckers, fly catchers and ducks stack on top of each other.
