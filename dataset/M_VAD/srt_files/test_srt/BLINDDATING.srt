00:25:49,00 --> 00:26:00,50

00:32:20,00 --> 00:32:24,50
As SOMEONE races to her bus SOMEONE smiles and waves.

00:32:28,00 --> 00:32:32,50
SOMEONE serves SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

BLINDDATING_DVS120
00:32:30,00 --> 00:32:36,50

Behind her back, SOMEONE shows a picture of a sexual pose. 

BLINDDATING_DVS123
00:33:08,00 --> 00:33:15,50
As SOMEONE glances back, SOMEONE hides the book and waves innocently at her. 

BLINDDATING_DVS124
00:33:14,00 --> 00:33:21,50
Now, in Dr. SOMEONE office, SOMEONE's doctors hover at his side. 

BLINDDATING_DVS125
00:33:30,00 --> 00:33:36,50
As SOMEONE exits the clinic, SOMEONE hurries after him.

00:33:43,00 --> 00:33:48,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

BLINDDATING_DVS127
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:22,50
They stand with their sandwiches. 

BLINDDATING_DVS128
00:35:26,00 --> 00:35:33,50
SOMEONE takes another bite of his sandwich and chews it thoughtfully. 

BLINDDATING_DVS129
00:35:33,00 --> 00:35:39,50
SOMEONE freezes mid chew, then swallows hard. 

BLINDDATING_DVS130
00:35:39,00 --> 00:35:47,50
SOMEONE's lips curl upward. Now, SOMEONE heads out of the Crimson Elephant.

SOMEONE swallows. 

BLINDDATING_DVS137
00:37:22,00 --> 00:37:27,50
Later, they slow dance. 

BLINDDATING_DVS138
00:38:00,00 --> 00:38:07,50
SOMEONE smiles mischievously as they continue to dance. 

BLINDDATING_DVS139

Now, SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk beneath the pergola covered in vines of red blossoms. 

BLINDDATING_DVS140
00:38:39,00 --> 00:38:46,50
SOMEONE adjusts the strap of her purse. They stop and face each other. 

BLINDDATING_DVS141
00:38:46,00 --> 00:38:51,50
She tucks her hair behind her ear. 

BLINDDATING_DVS142
00:38:55,00 --> 00:39:04,50
SOMEONE gently touches her neck and leans his lips toward hers. As SOMEONE accepts the tender kiss 

BLINDDATING_DVS143
00:39:02,00 --> 00:39:08,50
SOMEONE lifts his other hand to her thick shiny hair, and rubs 

BLINDDATING_DVS144
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:19,50
his thumb across her cheek. As they slowly withdraw, SOMEONE opens his eyes and lets down his hands. SOMEONE eyes blink open and her lips remain parted. They walk on. 

BLINDDATING_DVS145
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:25,50
SOMEONE with a hopeful smile; SOMEONE with a dumbfounded look. 

BLINDDATING_DVS146
00:39:22,00 --> 00:39:28,50

They stand staying face to face. 

BLINDDATING_DVS158
00:41:26,00 --> 00:41:34,50
SOMEONE's wide eyes fix intensely on SOMEONE. He takes a deep breath.

00:41:32,00 --> 00:41:41,50
SOMEONE impulsively puts her lips to his. SOMEONE's fingers cradle her face as he returns the passionate

00:41:54,00 --> 00:42:00,50
Tears flood SOMEONE's eyes as she retrieves her bag from the bench. 

BLINDDATING_DVS163
00:41:59,00 --> 00:42:06,50
Her brow wrinkle as she walks away. SOMEONE stands motionless and his eyelids flutter. 

BLINDDATING_DVS165
00:42:23,00 --> 00:42:28,50
SOMEONE sits with SOMEONE and their families. 

BLINDDATING_DVS166
00:42:41,00 --> 00:42:50,50
SOMEONE smiles across the table at SOMEONE who smiles hard. Now, SOMEONE dines with his family.

Fighting back tears, SOMEONE nods. Her mother holds her in a gentle embrace. 

BLINDDATING_DVS173
00:44:55,00 --> 00:45:02,50
Daytime. In the park, she sits near a pond with SOMEONE. 

BLINDDATING_DVS174
00:45:18,00 --> 00:45:24,50
He takes his hand out of hers. 

BLINDDATING_DVS175
00:45:25,00 --> 00:45:32,50
SOMEONE's lips tremble as he searches for words. 

BLINDDATING_DVS176
00:46:02,00 --> 00:46:10,50
SOMEONE wets her lips. SOMEONE stands, unfolds his cane and leaves. 

BLINDDATING_DVS177
00:46:10,00 --> 00:46:18,50
Remains motionless on the bench. Now, SOMEONE drives SOMEONE in the limo. 

BLINDDATING_DVS178
00:46:34,00 --> 00:46:41,50
Now at the ballpark, SOMEONE pitches a softball. 

BLINDDATING_DVS180
00:47:16,00 --> 00:47:23,50
Nighttime. SOMEONE and SOMEONE exit the Crimson Elephant. 

BLINDDATING_DVS181
00:47:26,00 --> 00:47:32,50
SOMEONE glances behind them.  

BLINDDATING_DVS182
00:47:34,00 --> 00:47:38,50
SOMEONE's mother and another woman help across the street. 

BLINDDATING_DVS184
00:48:05,00 --> 00:48:09,50
He hobbles down the sidewalk. She follows him. 

BLINDDATING_DVS185
00:48:11,00 --> 00:48:17,50
SOMEONE watches women spreading their legs in thigh machines. 

BLINDDATING_DVS186
00:48:17,00 --> 00:48:23,50
Below him, SOMEONE does bench presses. 

BLINDDATING_DVS187
00:48:24,00 --> 00:48:28,50
muscular guy watches, as SOMEONE sits up. 

BLINDDATING_DVS188
00:48:27,00 --> 00:48:33,50
The muscular guy grins. 

BLINDDATING_DVS189
00:48:36,00 --> 00:48:42,50
As SOMEONE stands by, SOMEONE holds the weights over his head. 

BLINDDATING_DVS190
00:48:49,00 --> 00:48:54,50
SOMEONE racks the weights and sits up. 

BLINDDATING_DVS191
00:48:54,00 --> 00:48:59,50
SOMEONE shakes his head. 

BLINDDATING_DVS192
00:48:57,00 --> 00:49:04,50
SOMEONE wryly regards the muscular guy's grin. 

BLINDDATING_DVS193
00:49:07,00 --> 00:49:14,50
Now at home, SOMEONE and SOMEONE stand by his open closet. 

BLINDDATING_DVS195
00:49:23,00 --> 00:49:41,50
Now, at La Ferrovia, SOMEONE sits across from a brunette with purple streaks in her hair. She smiles, sitting back in her chair. As SOMEONE sips wine, his date slips her foot out of her shoe and slides her toes up his leg. SOMEONE flattens his hands on the table. 

BLINDDATING_DVS196
00:49:40,00 --> 00:49:45,50
He reaches under him, pushes 

BLINDDATING_DVS197
00:49:57,00 --> 00:50:02,50
She lifts her cell phone. 

BLINDDATING_DVS198
00:50:02,00 --> 00:50:07,50
SOMEONE's smile sobers. 

BLINDDATING_DVS199
00:50:09,00 --> 00:50:14,50
She gives SOMEONE a once over. 

BLINDDATING_DVS200
00:50:12,00 --> 00:50:18,50
SOMEONE gulps wine and sets down the glass. 

BLINDDATING_DVS201
00:50:18,00 --> 00:50:24,50
Now, SOMEONE leaves with a hand on SOMEONE's shoulder. 

BLINDDATING_DVS202
00:50:24,00 --> 00:50:30,50
At the limo, SOMEONE feels for his brother and punches him. 

BLINDDATING_DVS204
00:50:56,00 --> 00:51:04,50
SOMEONE turns his head away from his brother. Wadded tissues plug SOMEONE's nose. 

BLINDDATING_DVS206
00:51:46,00 --> 00:51:51,50
SOMEONE hands him a fresh tissue. 

BLINDDATING_DVS207
00:51:54,00 --> 00:52:01,50
Daytime. Outside La Ferrovia, SOMEONE lets SOMEONE out of the limo. 

BLINDDATING_DVS208
00:52:33,00 --> 00:52:39,50
He turns sharply and heads toward the table for two. 

BLINDDATING_DVS210
00:52:41,00 --> 00:52:46,50
SOMEONE pulls out the other chair. 

BLINDDATING_DVS211
00:52:45,00 --> 00:52:54,50
SOMEONE circles around the table and hands SOMEONE a wine list. SOMEONE holds it up and faces it critically. 

BLINDDATING_DVS212
00:53:43,00 --> 00:53:48,50
Windows overlook the ballpark. 

BLINDDATING_DVS214
00:53:54,00 --> 00:53:59,50
He hands him a condom. 

BLINDDATING_DVS215
00:54:09,00 --> 00:54:15,50
SOMEONE takes it out of the packet. 

BLINDDATING_DVS216
00:54:15,00 --> 00:54:20,50
SOMEONE has a condom in his hand. A box of condoms sit open. 

BLINDDATING_DVS217
00:54:18,00 --> 00:54:22,50
SOMEONE talks on phone. 

BLINDDATING_DVS218
00:54:29,00 --> 00:54:34,50
A female passenger listens. 

BLINDDATING_DVS219
00:54:42,00 --> 00:54:48,50
He munches corn chips. 

BLINDDATING_DVS220
00:54:55,00 --> 00:55:02,50
SOMEONE opens the limo door. SOMEONE steps out, followed by a shapely young blonde. 

BLINDDATING_DVS222
00:55:09,00 --> 00:55:14,50
A new SOMEONE mans the reservations desk. 

BLINDDATING_DVS223
00:55:12,00 --> 00:55:17,50
A guest hands them some money. 

BLINDDATING_DVS224
00:55:20,00 --> 00:55:25,50
The blonde smiles up at SOMEONE. 

BLINDDATING_DVS225
00:55:33,00 --> 00:55:37,50
He checks his list. 

BLINDDATING_DVS226
00:55:40,00 --> 00:55:49,50
SOMEONE follows to the middle of the room, makes a sharp turn and proceeds to the corner table occupied by a Japanese couple. 

BLINDDATING_DVS227
00:55:47,00 --> 00:55:54,50
He sits with them. The SOMEONE approaches. 

BLINDDATING_DVS228
00:56:03,00 --> 00:56:12,50
SOMEONE reaches to his right and finds an arm. The Japanese man frowns at him. SOMEONE's jaw drops. 

BLINDDATING_DVS229
00:56:16,00 --> 00:56:24,50
At the far table, SOMEONE's date applies make up. SOMEONE signals the SOMEONE. 

BLINDDATING_DVS230
00:56:25,00 --> 00:56:32,50
SOMEONE's date mouths flattery to her reflection in her compact. 

BLINDDATING_DVS232
00:56:57,00 --> 00:57:03,50
SOMEONE sidles behind the SOMEONE. 

BLINDDATING_DVS234
00:57:28,00 --> 00:57:32,50
He sits. 

BLINDDATING_DVS235
00:57:30,00 --> 00:57:38,50
SOMEONE faces straight ahead, as his date's smile fades, he faces her. 

BLINDDATING_DVS236
00:57:39,00 --> 00:57:45,50
An elderly server steps to the table. 

BLINDDATING_DVS237
00:57:44,00 --> 00:57:49,50
SOMEONE takes the wine lists and holds it. 

BLINDDATING_DVS239
00:58:02,00 --> 00:58:26,50
Later, SOMEONE spoons the melty remnants of an ice cream sundae in to his mouth. His date swipes a cherry from the bowl. She holds its stem delicately in her fingertips and closes her mouth sensuously around the fruit. She eyes SOMEONE's unresponsive face. Spotting chocolate on her date's chin, she points to her chin, then lowers her tongue and points again. 

BLINDDATING_DVS240
00:58:27,00 --> 00:58:32,50
SOMEONE dabs his chin with his napkin. 

BLINDDATING_DVS243
00:58:49,00 --> 00:58:54,50
SOMEONE shakes his head. 

BLINDDATING_DVS244
00:58:54,00 --> 00:58:59,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

BLINDDATING_DVS245
00:58:58,00 --> 00:59:03,50
She kisses his cheek. 

BLINDDATING_DVS248
00:59:47,00 --> 00:59:51,50
Finger tips 

BLINDDATING_DVS249
00:59:54,00 --> 00:59:59,50
She watches the floodlit baseball field through the windows. 

BLINDDATING_DVS250
00:59:56,00 --> 01:00:01,50
He brings wine glasses. She turned. 

BLINDDATING_DVS251
00:59:59,00 --> 01:00:03,50
Wine spills down her dress. 

BLINDDATING_DVS252
01:00:51,00 --> 01:00:55,50
She grips a shelving unit. 

BLINDDATING_DVS254
01:01:14,00 --> 01:01:21,50
She prowls toward SOMEONE, reaches for his crotch. He recoils. 

BLINDDATING_DVS255
01:01:35,00 --> 01:02:02,50
SOMEONE smiles vacantly as the vexed woman slaps her butt in reply. SOMEONE glances at the sound. The woman reprises a few pelvic thrusts at the shelves, irritably grabs her dress and clutch and flounces off. The floodlights on the ball field go out. Now, seated in his bedroom at his parents’ house, SOMEONE peels off his dress shirt, he gets up and slams the door shut. 

BLINDDATING_DVS256
01:02:03,00 --> 01:02:11,50
Daytime. SOMEONE sits on a bench in a spacious and empty train station. 

BLINDDATING_DVS257
01:02:12,00 --> 01:02:16,50
He sweeps his fingertips across 

BLINDDATING_DVS258
01:02:14,00 --> 01:02:20,50
Downstairs, SOMEONE returns 

BLINDDATING_DVS259
01:02:25,00 --> 01:02:32,50
But the wall clock reads 3:25. 

BLINDDATING_DVS261
01:02:57,00 --> 01:03:02,50
SOMEONE squints at the passing city 

BLINDDATING_DVS262
01:04:38,00 --> 01:04:44,50
Later, they approach the clinic together. 

BLINDDATING_DVS263
01:04:44,00 --> 01:04:50,50
SOMEONE gets the door for SOMEONE, who enters alone. 

BLINDDATING_DVS264
01:04:52,00 --> 01:05:00,50
As he stops just inside, SOMEONE stands up behind the reception desk. 

BLINDDATING_DVS265
01:05:01,00 --> 01:05:12,50
SOMEONE feels his way to an empty seat. Wide-eyed, SOMEONE eagerly comes around to the front of the desk, but SOMEONE sits with his back to her. 

BLINDDATING_DVS266
01:05:21,00 --> 01:05:26,50
She makes the call, later. 

BLINDDATING_DVS267
01:05:37,00 --> 01:05:47,50
Later, crossing to the waiting room doors, SOMEONE stumbles on a toy dump truck. SOMEONE hurries to catch up as he exits. 

BLINDDATING_DVS268
01:05:56,00 --> 01:06:00,50
She keeps after him. 

BLINDDATING_DVS269
01:05:59,00 --> 01:06:04,50
SOMEONE watches her jog over. 

BLINDDATING_DVS270
01:06:03,00 --> 01:06:21,50
SOMEONE stops with SOMEONE at his side. He gives a faint bobble of his head, and they pass just in front of SOMEONE who waits by his limo. He watches SOMEONE lead the way with SOMEONE on his elbow. Now in the park, SOMEONE's cane taps a bench. 

BLINDDATING_DVS271
01:06:19,00 --> 01:06:31,50
SOMEONE sits first and faces forward. SOMEONE sits to his right, angled toward him. She lays her shoulder bag aside. 

BLINDDATING_DVS272
01:07:24,00 --> 01:07:30,50
SOMEONE's eyes pooled with tears. 

BLINDDATING_DVS273
01:07:30,00 --> 01:07:36,50
A tear spills down her smooth cheek. 

BLINDDATING_DVS274
01:07:52,00 --> 01:07:57,50
SOMEONE flashes a bashful smile. 

BLINDDATING_DVS275
01:07:58,00 --> 01:08:04,50
And he keeps his head bowed. His gaze stays facing forward. 

BLINDDATING_DVS276
01:08:07,00 --> 01:08:21,50
SOMEONE's pained gaze lingers on SOMEONE, then she leaves. Now in a visit with SOMEONE, Dr. SOMEONE cleans her eyeglasses as she sits fully dressed. 

BLINDDATING_DVS277
01:09:06,00 --> 01:09:12,50
Later, at the clinic. 

BLINDDATING_DVS278
01:09:41,00 --> 01:10:00,50
Now, orderlies wheel SOMEONE along on a gurney and SOMEONE looks on. As he passes, his head rolls to the side in her direction. Later, an OR light illuminates SOMEONE's restful face. In a waiting room, Dr. SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE's parents. 

BLINDDATING_DVS279
01:09:59,00 --> 01:10:09,50
The therapist takes a seat behind them. Mr. SOMEONE notices his wife staring off. Her lips stiff and tense. 

BLINDDATING_DVS280
01:10:26,00 --> 01:10:31,50
Mr. SOMEONE puts his arm around her. 

BLINDDATING_DVS281
01:10:40,00 --> 01:10:51,50
her head on him. In the OR, gloved hands use a trimmer to shave the hair above SOMEONE's right ear. Now, back in the waiting room. 

BLINDDATING_DVS282
01:10:49,00 --> 01:10:54,50
SOMEONE uses his cell phone. 

BLINDDATING_DVS283
01:10:53,00 --> 01:11:05,50
Now, SOMEONE's shaved temple lies framed by surgical clothes. And overlaid with iodine-treated film. SOMEONE folds his hands in the waiting room. 

BLINDDATING_DVS284
01:11:03,00 --> 01:11:20,50
A laser dot crosses an x-ray of SOMEONE's skull and Dr. SOMEONE takes up his scalpel. SOMEONE fidgets in the waiting room. A gloved hand in the OR reaches for a syringe, then a clamp, then discards bloody gauze. 

BLINDDATING_DVS285
01:11:18,00 --> 01:11:35,50
A microscopic view shows blood flow along a Y-shaped pathway. In the waiting room, Dr. SOMEONE puts on her glasses and exhales. Now, an assistant flips a pump run button and a pressure gauge needle swivels past 40. 

BLINDDATING_DVS286
01:11:33,00 --> 01:11:41,50
SOMEONE stares off. The surgical team works diligently. 

BLINDDATING_DVS287
01:11:38,00 --> 01:11:47,50
Later, SOMEONE's limo sits parked outside the neurosurgical center. Inside, Dr. SOMEONE approaches the family. 

BLINDDATING_DVS288
01:11:57,00 --> 01:12:13,50
Now, in recovery, SOMEONE lies with his eyes closed. A bandage wraps his head, and a tube and wire trail from his hand. His chest rises and falls steadily. SOMEONE arrives outside the glass pane door. 

BLINDDATING_DVS289
01:12:13,00 --> 01:12:27,50
Wearing a peaceful gaze, she strides eagerly to his bedside, leans in and kisses his cheek. She lets her brow brush his in a brief nuzzle, then straightens. 

BLINDDATING_DVS290
01:12:26,00 --> 01:12:32,50
SOMEONE takes a few calm breaths then leaves. 

BLINDDATING_DVS291
01:12:30,00 --> 01:12:40,50
Later, in a dim room, Dr. SOMEONE crouches down beside a conscious SOMEONE as Dr. SOMEONE looks on. 

BLINDDATING_DVS292
01:12:44,00 --> 01:12:51,50
A monitor shows a transmitter fitted in to SOMEONE's temple. 

BLINDDATING_DVS293
01:12:50,00 --> 01:12:58,50
Dr. Sato removes a power pack wired with a pair of modified sunglasses. 

BLINDDATING_DVS294
01:13:06,00 --> 01:13:12,50
The tiny camera sits mounted on the right lens. 

BLINDDATING_DVS295
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:23,50
SOMEONE winces. 

BLINDDATING_DVS296
01:13:27,00 --> 01:13:33,50
A flash shows black and white shapes. 

BLINDDATING_DVS297
01:13:31,00 --> 01:13:37,50
The doctors follow his gesture. 

BLINDDATING_DVS298
01:13:49,00 --> 01:13:55,50
It's a hazy window. SOMEONE reaches for it. 

BLINDDATING_DVS301
01:14:25,00 --> 01:14:37,50
In the evening, they bring SOMEONE home. As SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE watch eagerly, Mr.SOMEONE guides his wife closest to SOMEONE. 

BLINDDATING_DVS302
01:14:39,00 --> 01:14:44,50
SOMEONE winces a little. 

BLINDDATING_DVS303
01:14:42,00 --> 01:15:00,50
He glimpses a hazy black and white image of SOMEONE in the living room. More flashes reveal Dr. SOMEONE and SOMEONE. As SOMEONE relaxes, his mother briefly fills his view. He bows his head, then lets his touch recognize her face. 

BLINDDATING_DVS304
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:08,50
He looks again, sees her tender and emotional gaze and smiles at her. 

BLINDDATING_DVS305
01:15:09,00 --> 01:15:14,50
They share a tight hug. 

BLINDDATING_DVS306
01:15:14,00 --> 01:15:27,50
His mom rubs his back and cradles the nape of his neck. As SOMEONE's hand reaches out, his father's curious face cranes in to his view. Both men smile. 

BLINDDATING_DVS308
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:41,50
and squeezes him close in his arms. SOMEONE and Dr. SOMEONE tear up. Dr. SOMEONE keeps his eyes respectfully on the reunion. 

BLINDDATING_DVS309
01:15:41,00 --> 01:15:52,50
Now, father and son separate, and SOMEONE sees SOMEONE step forward with a fond smile. The brothers embrace. 

BLINDDATING_DVS310
01:15:51,00 --> 01:16:02,50
Their parents beam. Now, Mrs. SOMEONE eagerly reaches for SOMEONE to approach. 

BLINDDATING_DVS312
01:16:09,00 --> 01:16:15,50
SOMEONE holds him tight. 

BLINDDATING_DVS313
01:16:14,00 --> 01:16:19,50
And he straightens and looks to his left. 

BLINDDATING_DVS314
01:16:27,00 --> 01:16:34,50
Faces Dr. SOMEONE, takes in her warm, lovely smile, and gives her a hug. 

BLINDDATING_DVS315
01:16:37,00 --> 01:16:44,50
SOMEONE comes full circle and pats Dr. SOMEONE's lapels. 

BLINDDATING_DVS316
01:16:46,00 --> 01:16:51,50
Later, SOMEONE enters  

BLINDDATING_DVS317
01:16:48,00 --> 01:16:54,50
bedroom and reaches for the remote control. He turns on his TV. 

BLINDDATING_DVS318
01:16:59,00 --> 01:17:03,50
He touches the screen. 

BLINDDATING_DVS319
01:17:04,00 --> 01:17:08,50
She joins him. 

BLINDDATING_DVS320
01:17:12,00 --> 01:17:24,50
As his sister crosses in front of him, he follows. SOMEONE removes two framed baseball pictures from in front of a dresser-top mirror. She smiles at SOMEONE's reflection. 

BLINDDATING_DVS321
01:17:22,00 --> 01:17:27,50
He touches the glass. 

BLINDDATING_DVS322
01:17:28,00 --> 01:17:36,50
A hint of a smile crosses his lips. SOMEONE's camera view flares brightly. 

BLINDDATING_DVS324
01:17:41,00 --> 01:17:48,50
Now, downstairs, Dr. SOMEONE checks his eyes. 

BLINDDATING_DVS325
01:17:48,00 --> 01:17:55,50
SOMEONE complies. The two doctors swap nods. 

BLINDDATING_DVS326
01:17:53,00 --> 01:18:00,50
On another night, SOMEONE and SOMEONE lie head to toe on SOMEONE's bed. 

BLINDDATING_DVS327
01:17:58,00 --> 01:18:04,50
SOMEONE eats popcorn from a bowl on his belly. 

BLINDDATING_DVS329
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:27,50
Now, SOMEONE's parents show their daughter a card. 

BLINDDATING_DVS330
01:18:36,00 --> 01:18:46,50
SOMEONE forces a smile and walks away, leaving her parents perplexed. Morning. SOMEONE and his parents watch a newscast. 

BLINDDATING_DVS331
01:19:03,00 --> 01:19:08,50
A reporter meets SOMEONE. 

BLINDDATING_DVS332
01:19:37,00 --> 01:19:42,50
Later, SOMEONE overhears. 

BLINDDATING_DVS333
01:19:57,00 --> 01:20:03,50
Crimson Elephant, SOMEONE notices the TV report. 

BLINDDATING_DVS334
01:20:05,00 --> 01:20:10,50
her focus on the TV. On screen 

BLINDDATING_DVS335
01:20:10,00 --> 01:20:24,50
At home, SOMEONE's father enters his son's dark bedroom and turns on the light. SOMEONE lies on top of his bedspread. His hands folded on his chest. His father steps closer. 

BLINDDATING_DVS336
01:20:25,00 --> 01:20:34,50
Hiking up his pants, his father sits on the bed's edge and leans an arm over SOMEONE's legs. 

BLINDDATING_DVS337
01:20:43,00 --> 01:20:49,50
A little smile briefly crosses SOMEONE's lips. 

BLINDDATING_DVS338
01:21:17,00 --> 01:21:23,50
At the Crimson Elephant, SOMEONE and SOMEONE's families toast. 

BLINDDATING_DVS339
01:21:22,00 --> 01:21:40,50
Mr. SOMEONE sets down his champagne flute and presents a small tray to his son. As SOMEONE stands, he plucks a red ring box from a nest of fresh flowers. Across the table from him, SOMEONE stands, too. SOMEONE opens the box revealing a large diamond ring. 

BLINDDATING_DVS340
01:21:38,00 --> 01:21:46,50
SOMEONE's mother watches the young Indian man slide the ring on to her daughter's slender finger. 

BLINDDATING_DVS341
01:21:45,00 --> 01:22:02,50
SOMEONE gives him a tight-lipped smile. Meanwhile, SOMEONE feels around his desktop. He picks up the glasses and the battery pouch. Wearing a determined expression, he turns away. Now, he steps down the driveway, using his cane. 

BLINDDATING_DVS342
01:22:03,00 --> 01:22:11,50
Reaching the sidewalk, he takes a few steps to his right and pulls out a phone. 

BLINDDATING_DVS343
01:22:16,00 --> 01:22:33,50
Frowning, SOMEONE pockets the phone and heads off down the sidewalk in the opposite direction. At the Crimson Elephant, SOMEONE hurries to a phone behind a beaded curtain. Holding the receiver to her ear, she gazes at the engagement ring on her finger. 

BLINDDATING_DVS347
01:23:22,00 --> 01:23:29,50
SOMEONE reluctantly raises her champagne and forces a smile. She has a gloomy expression. 

BLINDDATING_DVS349
01:23:30,00 --> 01:23:36,50
Meanwhile, the bus arrives at a terminal. 

BLINDDATING_DVS350
01:25:07,00 --> 01:25:12,50
He puts the glasses back on. 

BLINDDATING_DVS351
01:26:18,00 --> 01:26:24,50
As Mr. SOMEONE glares, SOMEONE goes to SOMEONE. 

BLINDDATING_DVS352
01:26:30,00 --> 01:26:35,50
He takes off the glasses. 

BLINDDATING_DVS353
01:26:34,00 --> 01:26:39,50
her face is in his hands. 

BLINDDATING_DVS354
01:26:37,00 --> 01:26:42,50
SOMEONE and Mr. SOMEONE glare. 

BLINDDATING_DVS355
01:26:54,00 --> 01:27:00,50
SOMEONE's family watches attentively. 

BLINDDATING_DVS356
01:27:35,00 --> 01:27:53,50
SOMEONE's big brown eyes brim with tears and she pulls SOMEONE into a passionate kiss. SOMEONE storms out, followed by his father and mother. SOMEONE's father watches the kissing couple with a wistful smile. SOMEONE winces and falls to the floor. 

BLINDDATING_DVS357
01:27:55,00 --> 01:27:59,50
Now, an ambulance in front of restaurant. 

BLINDDATING_DVS358
01:28:11,00 --> 01:28:29,50
He gives a comforting pat to SOMEONE's mom then hurries off. SOMEONE's mother pulls SOMEONE close and they step over to a waiting area. SOMEONE's father follows. SOMEONE watches them walk past SOMEONE, who stands alone, still in her sari. 

BLINDDATING_DVS359
01:28:26,00 --> 01:28:33,50
As he smiles at her, she stares back tearful and 

BLINDDATING_DVS360
01:28:35,00 --> 01:28:44,50
Her lips tremble, and tears glisten in her eyes. SOMEONE takes a step closer. 

BLINDDATING_DVS361
01:28:44,00 --> 01:28:51,50
Meeting SOMEONE's sincere gaze, SOMEONE takes a shaky breath. 

BLINDDATING_DVS362
01:28:56,00 --> 01:29:04,50
SOMEONE gently puts a hand on her shoulder and guides her to the waiting area. 

BLINDDATING_DVS363
01:29:13,00 --> 01:29:20,50
SOMEONE's mother takes SOMEONE's hand in hers, then pulls her into 

BLINDDATING_DVS364
01:29:18,00 --> 01:29:39,50
SOMEONE rests one hand on his wife's shoulder and the other on SOMEONE's wrist. Now, SOMEONE sleeps in a hospital bed hooked up to monitors. A bandage covers one side of his head as Dr. SOMEONE watches from the doorway. SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the SOMEONE approach. SOMEONE shifts under the covers. 

BLINDDATING_DVS365
01:29:37,00 --> 01:29:42,50
They all rush to his bedside. 

BLINDDATING_DVS366
01:30:32,00 --> 01:30:39,50
SOMEONE leans his face close to SOMEONE's. 

BLINDDATING_DVS367
01:30:38,00 --> 01:30:43,50
He gently kisses her. 

BLINDDATING_DVS368
01:30:50,00 --> 01:30:56,50
Now, at the Crimson Elephant, SOMEONE dances with SOMEONE. 

BLINDDATING_DVS369
01:30:54,00 --> 01:30:59,50
wears a fuchsia pink sari.  

BLINDDATING_DVS371
01:33:26,00 --> 01:33:31,50
Their lips gently part. 

BLINDDATING_DVS372
01:33:30,00 --> 01:33:37,50
Now, as a train speeds down a track, SOMEONE laughs
