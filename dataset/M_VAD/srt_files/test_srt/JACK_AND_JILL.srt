JACK_AND_JILL_DVS20
00:02:42,00 --> 00:02:46,50
Then they slap at each other. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS22
00:02:44,00 --> 00:02:49,50
In a tub, bubbles rise from the little boy's bottom. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS23
00:02:48,00 --> 00:02:52,50
His sister lets one loose. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS24
00:02:54,00 --> 00:03:01,50
As children, the sister climbs into her brother's bed to snuggle. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS25
00:02:58,00 --> 00:03:05,50
Now, the preteen boy in braces shows off sprouting armpit hairs. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS26
00:03:03,00 --> 00:03:09,50
His sister passes and shows a bushy patch under her arm. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS27
00:03:06,00 --> 00:03:10,50
The boy wilts. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS28
00:03:08,00 --> 00:03:13,50
Outside, the teenage boy poses with a prom date. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS29
00:03:11,00 --> 00:03:15,50
His sister peeks from behind them. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS30
00:03:13,00 --> 00:03:19,50
At school, he waves - clad in a varsity jacket. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS31
00:03:16,00 --> 00:03:21,50
His sister runs into him with a French horn. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS32
00:03:18,00 --> 00:03:24,50
On a tennis court, the sister bounces a ball on the racket. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS33
00:03:21,00 --> 00:03:26,50
As her brother flirts with a girl. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS34
00:03:23,00 --> 00:03:28,50
The tennis ball nails the girl in the eye. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS35
00:03:25,00 --> 00:03:30,50
The boy walks away from his sister. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS36
00:03:27,00 --> 00:03:35,50
Now at a commercial shoot, a dark-haired man sits in the producer's chair, followed by a bespectacled assistant. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS37
00:03:37,00 --> 00:03:41,50
A stomach puppet shows up. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS38
00:04:45,00 --> 00:04:49,50
SOMEONE grabs a bottle of Pepto. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS39
00:04:50,00 --> 00:04:54,50
He chugs some down. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS40
00:04:55,00 --> 00:04:59,50
SOMEONE's assistant brings him a soda. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS41
00:05:46,00 --> 00:05:50,50
The assistant sips the Pepto. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS42
00:05:49,00 --> 00:05:54,50
Now, an alarm clock reads 3:30. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS43
00:05:51,00 --> 00:05:55,50
SOMEONE and his wife wake up. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS44
00:05:52,00 --> 00:05:56,50
He climbs out of bed. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS45
00:06:15,00 --> 00:06:19,50
Later at the airport. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS46
00:06:21,00 --> 00:06:28,50
In a deserted baggage claim area, SOMEONE spots a sleeping janitor slumped on the floor. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS47
00:06:25,00 --> 00:06:31,50
Then he sees a brunette woman near a dozen suitcases. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS48
00:06:34,00 --> 00:06:38,50
The manish woman spots her brother. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS49
00:07:03,00 --> 00:07:07,50
On the road. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS50
00:07:42,00 --> 00:07:46,50
SOMEONE puts down his window. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS51
00:07:47,00 --> 00:07:53,50
The indraft pins the cockatoo against the back of the cage. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS53
00:08:10,00 --> 00:08:14,50
The haggard man sulks. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS54
00:08:17,00 --> 00:08:22,50
In a pilgrim dress, SOMEONE demonstrates. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS55
00:08:32,00 --> 00:08:37,50
SOMEONE kicks and punches, startling SOMEONE. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS56
00:08:38,00 --> 00:08:45,50
Now, SOMEONE peeks into a guestroom where his broad-back sister sleeps on her side. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS57
00:08:42,00 --> 00:08:47,50
Poopsie perches on the footboard. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS58
00:09:27,00 --> 00:09:34,50
SOMEONE climbs out of bed, leaving behind a full body sweat stain on the sheet. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS59
00:09:31,00 --> 00:09:35,50
SOMEONE points. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS60
00:09:40,00 --> 00:09:45,50
Later, over Thanksgiving dinner. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS61
00:09:59,00 --> 00:10:03,50
SOMEONE's mother-in-law shifts nervously. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS62
00:10:35,00 --> 00:10:40,50
The girl sits beside a matching doll. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS63
00:10:59,00 --> 00:11:03,50
SOMEONE resumes eating. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS64
00:11:02,00 --> 00:11:05,50
He looks up. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS65
00:11:19,00 --> 00:11:24,50
She smiles at SOMEONE, who shakes his head. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS66
00:12:22,00 --> 00:12:27,50
The shirtless boy tapes a drumstick to his belly. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS67
00:12:48,00 --> 00:12:53,50
SOMEONE wears a saltshaker taped to his head. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS68
00:13:13,00 --> 00:13:17,50
SOMEONE slaps herself. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS69
00:13:16,00 --> 00:13:20,50
SOMEONE slaps herself in the face again. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS70
00:13:24,00 --> 00:13:29,50
SOMEONE punches SOMEONE off her chair. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS71
00:13:40,00 --> 00:13:45,50
She shakes it from SOMEONE's head. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS72
00:15:22,00 --> 00:15:27,50
SOMEONE pockets a dinner roll and heads out. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS73
00:15:34,00 --> 00:15:38,50
Eating, SOMEONE shakes his head. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS75
00:15:51,00 --> 00:15:55,50
SOMEONE falls on her face. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS76
00:16:48,00 --> 00:16:52,50
SOMEONE lies among the trees. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS77
00:16:54,00 --> 00:16:58,50
On YouTube. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS78
00:17:12,00 --> 00:17:18,50
Performing on stage, SOMEONE glares into the audience. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS79
00:17:42,00 --> 00:17:47,50
SOMEONE continues his call in the kitchen. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS80
00:17:57,00 --> 00:18:00,50
SOMEONE scowls. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS81
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:05,50
A landscaper peeks in from the patio. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS82
00:18:34,00 --> 00:18:39,50
He holds his hands out and stops moving. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS83
00:18:47,00 --> 00:18:51,50
He smiles at her as he leaves. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS84
00:18:49,00 --> 00:18:53,50
He waves affectionately. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS85
00:18:58,00 --> 00:19:02,50
She pulls a slip of paper from her bra. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS86
00:19:49,00 --> 00:19:57,50
Now, SOMEONE and SOMEONE exits a shop called My Tiny Me dressed in costumes. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS87
00:19:54,00 --> 00:19:59,50
Each holding a doll that matches their outfit. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS88
00:19:58,00 --> 00:20:02,50
At a pony rodeo in a park. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS89
00:20:02,00 --> 00:20:07,50
The kids ride pass SOMEONE and an employee. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS90
00:20:06,00 --> 00:20:12,50
Later, she hoists herself onto a tiny pony. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS91
00:20:12,00 --> 00:20:16,50
The horse collapses. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS92
00:20:14,00 --> 00:20:19,50
Its legs are completely splayed. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS93
00:20:19,00 --> 00:20:25,50
At home, SOMEONE rides a bike with a hamster taped to his back. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS94
00:20:26,00 --> 00:20:33,50
Now, wrapped presents lie on a table as six candles burn on a menorah. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS95
00:20:30,00 --> 00:20:37,50
SOMEONE awakes on the sofa and notices a lady's meaty fingers caressing his arm. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS96
00:20:35,00 --> 00:20:42,50
He turns around to find SOMEONE snuggled up against him, watching him with a big creepy smile. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS97
00:20:42,00 --> 00:20:46,50
He falls to the floor. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS98
00:20:48,00 --> 00:20:52,50
At a TV taping. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS99
00:21:24,00 --> 00:21:29,50
Spinning the big wheel, SOMEONE knocks herself unconscious. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS100
00:21:34,00 --> 00:21:39,50
In a truck, overfilled with prizes. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS101
00:21:46,00 --> 00:21:52,50
At home, SOMEONE watches Scarface on his computer. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS102
00:21:55,00 --> 00:22:03,50
He looks outside to find SOMEONE riding her newly won jet ski in the backyard swimming pool. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS103
00:22:06,00 --> 00:22:13,50
She submerges then shoots 20 feet out of the water and crashes down on the patio table. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS104
00:22:11,00 --> 00:22:17,50
With a grin plastered on his face, SOMEONE turns back to his movie. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS105
00:22:15,00 --> 00:22:21,50
Later, the family watches a movie together at a theater. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS106
00:22:18,00 --> 00:22:24,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE both stuff popcorn into their slack-jawed mouths. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS107
00:22:22,00 --> 00:22:28,50
Sitting between them, SOMEONE notices their identical mannerisms. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS108
00:22:34,00 --> 00:22:38,50
The twins each clear their throats. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS109
00:22:40,00 --> 00:22:45,50
They pry straight popcorn kernels out of their mouths, then eat them. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS111
00:22:55,00 --> 00:23:00,50
Watching the movie, the twins crack up. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS112
00:23:01,00 --> 00:23:07,50
SOMEONE self-consciously stops laughing and glances over at his sister. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS113
00:23:05,00 --> 00:23:11,50
He sets aside his popcorn to change his posture from matching hers. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS114
00:23:13,00 --> 00:23:18,50
He gruffly folds his arms. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS115
00:23:19,00 --> 00:23:24,50
SOMEONE looks over at him and gives a friendly wave. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS116
00:23:31,00 --> 00:23:37,50
They both rest their cheeks against theirs fists and scratch their groins. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS117
00:23:35,00 --> 00:23:39,50
Then look around furtively. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS118
00:23:44,00 --> 00:23:50,50
In unison, they both casually wave the smell away from themselves. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS119
00:23:52,00 --> 00:23:57,50
SOMEONE digs her phone out of her bra. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS120
00:24:16,00 --> 00:24:21,50
She tearfully grabs her purse and gets up. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS121
00:24:25,00 --> 00:24:29,50
The rest of the family follows her off. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS122
00:24:35,00 --> 00:24:40,50
He deliberately spills his popcorn on the smart aleck. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS124
00:24:38,00 --> 00:24:43,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE lie asleep. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS125
00:24:41,00 --> 00:24:45,50
They wake up. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS126
00:24:44,00 --> 00:24:50,50
SOMEONE goes to the window and sees SOMEONE on a riding lawn mower. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS127
00:24:48,00 --> 00:24:53,50
The cut grass blows at SOMEONE as he chases her. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS128
00:25:22,00 --> 00:25:26,50
At breakfast. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS129
00:25:55,00 --> 00:25:59,50
SOMEONE overhears. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS131
00:26:42,00 --> 00:26:46,50
She grooves. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS132
00:26:49,00 --> 00:26:53,50
She touches the screen. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS133
00:26:54,00 --> 00:26:58,50
SOMEONE clicks the mouse. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS134
00:26:59,00 --> 00:27:03,50
SOMEONE points to SOMEONE. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS135
00:27:20,00 --> 00:27:24,50
She laughs to the kids. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS136
00:27:32,00 --> 00:27:38,50
The photo shows SOMEONE about the chow down on a greasy sandwich. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS137
00:27:58,00 --> 00:28:04,50
Now, an ad shows Shaquille O'Neal wearing a long gray wig. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS138
00:28:05,00 --> 00:28:09,50
He flaunts championship rings. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS139
00:28:10,00 --> 00:28:14,50
He gnaws on the packaged SOMEONE. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS140
00:28:20,00 --> 00:28:25,50
Shaq cuddles with the SOMEONE then licks it. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS141
00:29:12,00 --> 00:29:17,50
SOMEONE sheepishly excuses himself. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS142
00:29:14,00 --> 00:29:20,50
That evening, SOMEONE arrives home in his silver Cadillac Escalade. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS143
00:29:18,00 --> 00:29:22,50
He peeks in the guest room. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS144
00:29:21,00 --> 00:29:29,50
Her mascara smeared, SOMEONE lies asleep cuddling Poopsie among a pile of used tissues covering the bed. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS145
00:29:26,00 --> 00:29:30,50
The kids approached SOMEONE. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS146
00:29:45,00 --> 00:29:52,50
He takes another look at his sister who sleeps soundly atop the covers, fully clothed. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS147
00:29:49,00 --> 00:29:55,50
Later, SOMEONE works at his Sony VAIO computer. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS148
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:04,50
He types a few keystrokes. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS150
00:30:32,00 --> 00:30:37,50
SOMEONE climbs off her sweat-stained bed. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS151
00:30:38,00 --> 00:30:44,50
SOMEONE gets out of the shower and finds his sister sitting on the toilet. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS152
00:30:49,00 --> 00:30:54,50
She massages SOMEONE with a choke cold. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS153
00:30:57,00 --> 00:31:02,50
SOMEONE knocks herself out on the Prize is Right. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS154
00:31:17,00 --> 00:31:21,50
SOMEONE stands behind him. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS155
00:31:22,00 --> 00:31:28,50
The boy runs off with Poopsie taped to his back. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS157
00:31:49,00 --> 00:31:53,50
SOMEONE does a Raise the Roof dance. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS158
00:32:05,00 --> 00:32:10,50
SOMEONE finds his son staring at him. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS160
00:32:36,00 --> 00:32:41,50
SOMEONE opens the door to a dower, clean cut man. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS161
00:32:53,00 --> 00:32:57,50
SOMEONE grabs him. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS162
00:33:01,00 --> 00:33:06,50
SOMEONE comes downstairs in slow motion. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS163
00:33:03,00 --> 00:33:08,50
Wearing a shimmery teal outfit. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS164
00:33:05,00 --> 00:33:10,50
With a fuzzy shawl and cap, and a ruffled skirt. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS165
00:33:13,00 --> 00:33:20,50
A slack-jawed SOMEONE shakes his head admiringly. His sister beams. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS166
00:33:20,00 --> 00:33:27,50
SOMEONE holds a doll that looks exactly like SOMEONE dressed in a matching outfit. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS167
00:33:24,00 --> 00:33:30,50
A horrified SOMEONE grimaces painfully at his date. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS168
00:33:28,00 --> 00:33:32,50
Later at a restaurant. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS169
00:33:51,00 --> 00:33:55,50
She flaps her jaw. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS170
00:34:15,00 --> 00:34:20,50
SOMEONE scoots out of their booth. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS171
00:34:19,00 --> 00:34:25,50
Awhile later, SOMEONE sits alone in front of two uneaten salads on the table. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS172
00:34:35,00 --> 00:34:39,50
She idly drums her hands. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS173
00:34:37,00 --> 00:34:40,50
Now in the men's room. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS174
00:34:42,00 --> 00:34:46,50
SOMEONE peeks in. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS175
00:34:46,00 --> 00:34:50,50
She tentatively steps inside. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS176
00:34:49,00 --> 00:34:53,50
She moves toward a closed stall. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS177
00:34:55,00 --> 00:35:00,50
Opening the door, she finds it empty. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS178
00:34:57,00 --> 00:35:01,50
She frowns to herself. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS179
00:34:58,00 --> 00:35:02,50
Fighting back tears. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS180
00:35:07,00 --> 00:35:10,50
She leaves. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS181
00:35:08,00 --> 00:35:16,50
On the ceiling above the toilet stall, SOMEONE clings hand and foot to a lighting fixture. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS182
00:35:13,00 --> 00:35:18,50
At home, the kids play air hockey. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS183

SOMEONE keeps his gaze downward. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS195
00:37:36,00 --> 00:37:42,50
The camera zooms in on his face, and his name flashes below it. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS196
00:38:02,00 --> 00:38:08,50
Ignoring him, SOMEONE takes a long sip of his drink through a straw.

00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:25,50
Everyone suddenly acts casual as SOMEONE presents a giant cake, ringed with candles. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS221

With a bashful smile, SOMEONE walks onto the makeshift dance floor of flattened cardboard boxes. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS263
00:52:12,00 --> 00:52:19,50

Back in the soccer game. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS271
00:52:41,00 --> 00:52:48,50
As she kicks, her shoe flies off. It hits SOMEONE's grandma, knocking her out. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS272
00:52:46,00 --> 00:52:51,50
Her family feeds her peppers, rousing her.

She hurries upstairs. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS300
00:57:44,00 --> 00:57:50,50
SOMEONE eyes a spoonful of refried beans, then puts down her bowl. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS301
00:57:48,00 --> 00:57:52,50
Later outside the bathroom. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS302
00:58:26,00 --> 00:58:31,50
Fixing her belt, SOMEONE steps out of the bathroom. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS303
00:58:31,00 --> 00:58:35,50
SOMEONE cringes.

00:58:35,00 --> 00:58:41,50
He looks around then opens a door for some air. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS305
00:58:48,00 --> 00:58:53,50

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS306
00:58:58,00 --> 00:59:03,50
He lights a candle and fans the air with his hand. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS307
00:59:24,00 --> 00:59:29,50
In the doorway, the cheering kids hold their noses. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS308
00:59:29,00 --> 00:59:34,50
The cockatoo holds his beak. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS309
00:59:31,00 --> 00:59:37,50
Now, a massive cruise ship sails past the Coastal Resort.

As two cruise employees turn a jump rope, SOMEONE, in the middle, stumbles. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS332
01:04:16,00 --> 01:04:23,50
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE jump double Dutch, side by side, a crowd gathers. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS333
01:04:24,00 --> 01:04:31,50
The twins kick their feet backward then point their fingers posing with every jump. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS334
01:04:31,00 --> 01:04:35,50
They hold their arms out like mummies. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS335
01:04:35,00 --> 01:04:43,50
In a series of intricate steps, they tap their ankles, turn around, then stop, posing shoulder to shoulder. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS336
01:04:41,00 --> 01:04:46,50

01:05:41,00 --> 01:05:49,50
Chugging SOMEONE's, Poopsie tips over. At night, in SOMEONE's closet, SOMEONE checks her dresses.

Now he enters a public restroom and faces an attendant who bows politely. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS344
01:06:13,00 --> 01:06:19,50
Crossing the room, SOMEONE looks again at the balding man twice. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS345
01:06:16,00 --> 01:06:21,50
The valet bows in kind each time. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS346
01:06:19,00 --> 01:06:25,50
SOMEONE enters the stall and the attendant turns to a counter of toiletries. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS347
01:06:22,00 --> 01:06:28,50
In the stall, SOMEONE drops the bag on the toilet. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS348
01:06:25,00 --> 01:06:30,50
He puts on lipstick and press on nails. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS349
01:06:27,00 --> 01:06:36,50
He lathers his chest with shaving cream then shaves it. Rinses his razor in the toilet water and shaves his legs. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS350
01:06:33,00 --> 01:06:40,50
He stuffs two melons in his bra. Then sprays himself with perfume. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS351
01:06:37,00 --> 01:06:44,50
Padding his rear end with a life vest, he dawns the floral dress and a long wig. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS352
01:06:42,00 --> 01:06:52,50
Now dressed as SOMEONE, SOMEONE exits the stall. Looks at himself in the mirror and notices the attendant waiting with the towel draped over his forearm. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS353
01:06:53,00 --> 01:06:58,50
The balding man sternly gestures for SOMEONE to approach. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS354
01:06:56,00 --> 01:07:00,50
SOMEONE opens his arms inquisitively. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS355
01:06:58,00 --> 01:07:02,50
Then shuffles over. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS356
01:07:04,00 --> 01:07:10,50
The attendant holds eye contact then grabs and shifts SOMEONE's melons. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS357
01:07:08,00 --> 01:07:14,50
The old valet gives his own fingers a kiss of approval. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS358
01:07:12,00 --> 01:07:17,50
SOMEONE smiles bashfully. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS359
01:07:14,00 --> 01:07:20,50
Later, he climbs a staircase to the empty deck and looks around. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS360
01:07:18,00 --> 01:07:24,50
As he paces, wind buffets his 60s style floral dress. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS361
01:07:27,00 --> 01:07:32,50
A rope ladder hits him on the head. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS362
01:07:31,00 --> 01:07:38,50
In a helicopter, SOMEONE points to a cheesecake in the shape of his own head. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS363
01:07:47,00 --> 01:07:51,50
SOMEONE climbs onto the rope ladder. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS364
01:07:53,00 --> 01:07:57,50
The copter carries him off. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS365
01:07:55,00 --> 01:08:00,50
Later, we circle a medieval castle. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS366
01:07:57,00 --> 01:08:04,50
Its exquisite stone dining room features a vaulted ceiling and candlelit chandeliers of iron. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS367
01:08:27,00 --> 01:08:33,50
SOMEONE addresses a mustached servant, who struggles to understand him. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS368
01:08:32,00 --> 01:08:37,50
The servant presents a liquor bottle. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS369
01:08:42,00 --> 01:08:46,50
They do shots. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS370
01:09:38,00 --> 01:09:42,50
As SOMEONE holds up his arms, 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS371
01:09:39,00 --> 01:09:44,50
SOMEONE tickles away. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS372
01:09:41,00 --> 01:09:45,50
SOMEONE squirms. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS373
01:09:42,00 --> 01:09:48,50
He grabs a bowl from the table and shatters it. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS374
01:09:47,00 --> 01:09:52,50
SOMEONE backs off and SOMEONE brightens. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS375
01:10:00,00 --> 01:10:06,50
SOMEONE grabs the liquor bottle from the servant and chugs. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS376
01:10:03,00 --> 01:10:10,50
Now in the gym, SOMEONE rides an exercise bike beside two body builders. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS377
01:10:20,00 --> 01:10:24,50
She pumps major iron. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS378
01:10:23,00 --> 01:10:29,50
The body builders watch SOMEONE easily curl what they struggled with. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS379
01:10:48,00 --> 01:10:53,50
She works the heavier weight even faster. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS380
01:10:58,00 --> 01:11:02,50
SOMEONE sets down the bar. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS381
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:26,50
One body builder strains to curl the heavy bar. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS382
01:11:28,00 --> 01:11:33,50
Now, a record plays on a turntable. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS383
01:11:30,00 --> 01:11:37,50
In the Spanish castle, SOMEONE swigs from the bottle as he dances with SOMEONE. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS384
01:11:40,00 --> 01:11:44,50
The servant bops to the music. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS385
01:11:42,00 --> 01:11:46,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE bumped rears. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS386
01:11:46,00 --> 01:11:50,50
SOMEONE calls from the ship. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS387
01:12:44,00 --> 01:12:49,50
Crying, SOMEONE lowers her cellphone and hangs her head. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS388
01:12:48,00 --> 01:12:54,50
The balding valet steps out from the restroom and spots her. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS389
01:12:51,00 --> 01:12:56,50
SOMEONE notices him and straightens demurely. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS390
01:12:54,00 --> 01:12:59,50
The attendant gestures for her to approach. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS391
01:12:56,00 --> 01:13:01,50
And the manish woman points inquisitively to herself. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS392
01:12:59,00 --> 01:13:03,50
The valet nods. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS393
01:13:00,00 --> 01:13:04,50
And she ambles over. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS394
01:13:06,00 --> 01:13:11,50
The balding man grabs and shifts her breasts. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS395
01:13:09,00 --> 01:13:14,50
She glances at them, then eyes the valet. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS396
01:13:11,00 --> 01:13:15,50
He grins. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS397
01:13:12,00 --> 01:13:20,50
SOMEONE delivers a right hook that knocks him clear through a door onto the floor of the adjacent restroom. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS398
01:13:42,00 --> 01:13:48,50
SOMEONE slaps him hard. SOMEONE staggers back from his chair. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS399
01:13:48,00 --> 01:13:52,50
SOMEONE breaks a bottle. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS400
01:13:59,00 --> 01:14:03,50
SOMEONE charges. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS401
01:14:00,00 --> 01:14:06,50
SOMEONE sidesteps and breaks the chair over his back. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS402
01:14:06,00 --> 01:14:12,50
Getting up, SOMEONE finds his melon boobs pushed at his shoulders. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS403
01:14:17,00 --> 01:14:21,50
He furtively puts them back in place. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS404
01:14:48,00 --> 01:14:52,50
The nearby butler nods. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS405
01:15:36,00 --> 01:15:41,50
His brow furrowed, SOMEONE lowers his remorseful gaze. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS406
01:15:47,00 --> 01:15:52,50
His chef accompanies him on the piano. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS407
01:16:34,00 --> 01:16:38,50
SOMEONE makes a call. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS408
01:16:49,00 --> 01:16:54,50
Back on the ship, SOMEONE uses his cell. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS409
01:17:00,00 --> 01:17:04,50
Half in costume, he knocks on a door. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS410
01:17:02,00 --> 01:17:07,50
His wife and kids come out of the next room. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS411
01:17:09,00 --> 01:17:13,50
He eyes his dress. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS412
01:17:32,00 --> 01:17:37,50
SOMEONE sad face becomes SOMEONE's. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS413
01:17:35,00 --> 01:17:42,50
She wears a winter coat and hat, and carries a grocery bag crammed with junk food. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS414
01:17:40,00 --> 01:17:44,50
In her leg warmers. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS415
01:17:41,00 --> 01:17:47,50
She makes her way toward a modest house in a working class neighborhood. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS416
01:17:44,00 --> 01:17:51,50
An aboveground pool stands among the shrubs, in the snowy yard. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS417
01:17:49,00 --> 01:17:57,50
Now, a window edged with frost frames SOMEONE as she stands at a table inside, unpacking her groceries. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS418
01:17:58,00 --> 01:18:04,50
Now, a car pulls up across the street from a neighborhood restaurant. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS419
01:18:01,00 --> 01:18:06,50
A banner out front reads. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS420
01:18:03,00 --> 01:18:07,50
New Year's Eve. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS421
01:18:05,00 --> 01:18:10,50
At the wheel, SOMEONE wears a tiara and subtle make up. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS422
01:18:08,00 --> 01:18:12,50
She demurely powders her nose. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS423
01:18:10,00 --> 01:18:14,50
Then reaches in her bag and takes out 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS424
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:16,50
A framed photo of a silver-haired woman. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS425
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:27,50
She gets out of the car, hugging the photo close in one arm. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS426
01:18:25,00 --> 01:18:29,50
Now, in a booth. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS427
01:18:26,00 --> 01:18:35,50
A masculine blonde woman wearing a bouffant and a flashy navel revealing dress sits among other gaudy friends. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS428
01:18:40,00 --> 01:18:46,50
SOMEONE emerges from the crowd and sits alone at a table by a pillar. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS429
01:18:55,00 --> 01:18:59,50
SOMEONE sets out the photo. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS430
01:20:24,00 --> 01:20:30,50
With the kids, SOMEONE gives a perplexed smile. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS431
01:20:27,00 --> 01:20:32,50
The catty, man-faced blonde glares. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS432
01:20:29,00 --> 01:20:34,50
Her date stares cross-eyed. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS433
01:20:39,00 --> 01:20:42,50
They kiss. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS434
01:21:00,00 --> 01:21:04,50
They hug. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS435
01:21:06,00 --> 01:21:11,50
SOMEONE mouths thank you to SOMEONE. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS436
01:21:08,00 --> 01:21:12,50
She nods. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS437
01:21:09,00 --> 01:21:15,50
The catty blonde struts over and thumbs Erin’s shoulder. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS438
01:21:34,00 --> 01:21:38,50
SOMEONE turns, her eyes wide. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS439
01:21:38,00 --> 01:21:42,50
She grabs SOMEONE. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS440
01:21:40,00 --> 01:21:46,50
SOMEONE holds SOMEONE in the headlock and flings her around. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS441
01:21:48,00 --> 01:21:53,50
SOMEONE attacks SOMEONE, who releases SOMEONE. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS442
01:21:50,00 --> 01:21:55,50
She flings SOMEONE into a wall. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS443
01:21:52,00 --> 01:21:59,50
A spear pops a balloon and SOMEONE arrives as SOMEONE Quixote. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS444
01:22:00,00 --> 01:22:05,50
SOMEONE's cross-eyed date stares. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS445
01:22:18,00 --> 01:22:22,50
SOMEONE sneaks up with a bottle. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS446
01:22:21,00 --> 01:22:25,50
Without turning, SOMEONE punches her out. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS447
01:22:48,00 --> 01:22:53,50
SOMEONE spears the ceiling fan. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS448
01:22:56,00 --> 01:23:01,50
SOMEONE and her family arrive at the house. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS449
01:22:59,00 --> 01:23:07,50
SOMEONE and his kids finished shoveling the yard. Now green and done up in topiary hearts. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS450
01:24:13,00 --> 01:24:19,50
She leaps into SOMEONE's arms and he falls back. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS451
01:24:20,00 --> 01:24:27,50
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the kids rush over as SOMEONE's kids pile on to the new lovebirds. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS453
01:24:32,00 --> 01:24:36,50
A commercial, SOMEONE struts into a Dunkin' Donuts. 

JACK_AND_JILL_DVS454
01:25:16,00 --> 01:25:21,50
The cut pauses on the TV in SOMEONE's office.
