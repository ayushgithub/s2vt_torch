21_JUMP_STREET_DVS20
00:02:53,00 --> 00:02:59,50
Now outside, SOMEONE kicks over a trashcan. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS21
00:02:57,00 --> 00:03:02,50
Sitting on a nearby bench, the nerd looks over. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS22
00:03:00,00 --> 00:03:06,50
The jock slumps down on a bench on the other side of two columns. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS23
00:03:03,00 --> 00:03:09,50
With tearful eyes he notices the awkward teen watching him. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS24
00:03:07,00 --> 00:03:12,50
Tucking his longhair behind his ear, SOMEONE leaves. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS25
00:03:10,00 --> 00:03:15,50
The nerd wipes his own tears and stands. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS26
00:03:12,00 --> 00:03:18,50
He gives the trashcan a kick then grabs his aching leg. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS27
00:03:17,00 --> 00:03:22,50
Words appear. Seven years later. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS28
00:03:19,00 --> 00:03:24,50
His close cropped hair now caramel brown. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS29
00:03:22,00 --> 00:03:31,50
The nerd enters the Metropolitan City Police Academy wearing a blue uniform and takes his place in a registration line. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS30
00:03:33,00 --> 00:03:39,50
Ahead in line, SOMEONE now sporting a buzz cut spots him. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS31
00:03:39,00 --> 00:03:47,50
The former nerd musters a courteous nod. Now students spar in a hand-to-hand combat class. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS32
00:03:46,00 --> 00:03:50,50
SOMEONE lifts the former nerd. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS33
00:03:48,00 --> 00:03:53,50
He slams him down on the mat and raises his fist. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS34
00:03:53,00 --> 00:03:58,50
In another class SOMEONE gets an F on a test. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS35
00:03:57,00 --> 00:04:03,50
He notices SOMEONE's test which boasts a perfect score. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS36
00:04:07,00 --> 00:04:14,50
On an obstacle course, SOMEONE finishes a tire run then roots for SOMEONE. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS37
00:04:15,00 --> 00:04:19,50
Now SOMEONE tutors him. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS38
00:04:22,00 --> 00:04:30,50
Now by SOMEONE's bed, SOMEONE shoots him with a toy gun. Then lifts his mattress, dumping him off. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS39
00:04:28,00 --> 00:04:32,50
Later he drags SOMEONE through a jog. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS40
00:04:33,00 --> 00:04:39,50
In a training course cutout targets swing out at them and they shoot. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS41
00:04:38,00 --> 00:04:43,50
The oddly matched recruits cover each other. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS42
00:04:41,00 --> 00:04:46,50
As SOMEONE finishes the tire run 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS43
00:04:43,00 --> 00:04:47,50
the teacher gives a thumbs up. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS44
00:04:45,00 --> 00:04:51,50
In class, SOMEONE gets a test back and pumps his fist. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS46
00:04:50,00 --> 00:04:55,50
He proudly shows his score, a C-. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS47
00:04:53,00 --> 00:04:58,50
They bump fists. At graduation. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS48
00:05:06,00 --> 00:05:11,50
SOMEONE smirks and SOMEONE beams. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS49
00:05:11,00 --> 00:05:18,50
Now partners, they patrol a tranquil public park on bicycles. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS50
00:05:20,00 --> 00:05:25,50
With teens at a pond. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS51
00:05:24,00 --> 00:05:29,50
SOMEONE fishes it from the water. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS52
00:05:27,00 --> 00:05:31,50
He hurls it back. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS53
00:05:29,00 --> 00:05:35,50
Later he beats SOMEONE at red-hands. Now they flip their guns. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS54
00:05:43,00 --> 00:05:48,50
A boy defiantly holds out torn bread. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS55
00:05:50,00 --> 00:05:54,50
SOMEONE stares ahead. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS56
00:05:54,00 --> 00:05:58,50
He sees a biker gang. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS57
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:04,50
They pass a joint around. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS58
00:06:07,00 --> 00:06:12,50
SOMEONE struts off. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS59
00:06:11,00 --> 00:06:17,50
Now the partners furiously pedal their bicycles across a green lawn. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS60
00:06:15,00 --> 00:06:20,50
Little red and blue lights twinkle on their handlebars. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS61
00:06:17,00 --> 00:06:24,50
Reaching their destination, they climb off their bikes and lower their kickstands. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS62
00:06:21,00 --> 00:06:26,50
The rookies approach the biker gang. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS63
00:06:37,00 --> 00:06:42,50
SOMEONE smacks the joint from the leader's hand. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS64
00:07:20,00 --> 00:07:24,50
The bikers scatter. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS65
00:07:26,00 --> 00:07:30,50
SOMEONE gets on his bike. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS66
00:07:30,00 --> 00:07:34,50
SOMEONE chases the leader on foot. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS67
00:07:35,00 --> 00:07:40,50
A fat bearded biker crosses the bridge. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS68
00:07:39,00 --> 00:07:43,50
SOMEONE rides after him. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS70
00:07:48,00 --> 00:07:55,50
Pulling out in front of the bearded bikers, SOMEONE gets off his bike and draws his gun. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS71
00:08:01,00 --> 00:08:07,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE vaults off a post and tackles the leader. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS73
00:08:08,00 --> 00:08:13,50
The biker knocks him over and runs off. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS74
00:08:12,00 --> 00:08:16,50
With the gang leader. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS75
00:08:22,00 --> 00:08:28,50
Straddling the leader's rear, SOMEONE humps him as he cuffs him. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS76
00:08:32,00 --> 00:08:41,50
SOMEONE leaps into SOMEONE's arms and the athletic cop swings his partner around. They face the gang leader. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS77
00:08:40,00 --> 00:08:47,50
As SOMEONE pretends to hump him SOMEONE kneels by his face. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS78
00:08:46,00 --> 00:08:52,50
Nearby young families gawk with horrified expressions. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS79
00:08:54,00 --> 00:09:00,50
SOMEONE fires his gun skyward and the families flee. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS80
00:08:58,00 --> 00:09:04,50
Later, they strut into a police station passing two hookers. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS82
00:10:22,00 --> 00:10:27,50
In an office, The Deputy Chief flicks the cut. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS83
00:11:19,00 --> 00:11:24,50
Now outside an abandoned church. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS84
00:11:25,00 --> 00:11:34,50
SOMEONE parks a faded hatchback at the curb. Getting out with him, SOMEONE reads a sign at the entrance printed in Korean and English. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS85
00:11:34,00 --> 00:11:39,50
He leads his partner through the front gate. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS86
00:11:36,00 --> 00:11:42,50
Stickers on its mailbox spell out 21 Jump Street. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS87
00:11:40,00 --> 00:11:44,50
Stepping inside. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS88
00:11:41,00 --> 00:11:48,50
The uniform cops walk through a storage area and enter a small chapel. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS89
00:11:45,00 --> 00:11:51,50
Where youthful looking cops in street clothes lounge in the pews. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS90
00:11:53,00 --> 00:12:00,50
A woman with long blonde hair turns. So does an Asian woman with bleached hair. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS91
00:11:58,00 --> 00:12:03,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit in the rear pew. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS92
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:07,50
An older African-American police officer wearing a badge on one hip 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS93
00:12:04,00 --> 00:12:11,50
and a gun on the other steps out to the pulpit and scowls at them. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS94
00:12:12,00 --> 00:12:16,50
SOMEONE nods meekly. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS95
00:12:47,00 --> 00:12:52,50
He spreads his hands in a dramatic shrug. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS96
00:12:58,00 --> 00:13:02,50
He points out SOMEONE. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS98
00:13:23,00 --> 00:13:28,50
Now in the headquarters make-shift bullpen. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS99
00:13:44,00 --> 00:13:49,50
The Captain eyes SOMEONE. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS101
00:14:22,00 --> 00:14:26,50
An online video. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS102
00:14:25,00 --> 00:14:29,50
He shows drugs. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS103
00:14:47,00 --> 00:14:53,50
A colorful title card appears on the video. Phase One: The Gigs. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS104
00:14:51,00 --> 00:14:55,50
The teens laughs uncontrollably. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS105
00:14:53,00 --> 00:14:57,50
Another title. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS106
00:14:54,00 --> 00:14:59,50
Phase Two: Tripping Major Ballsack. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS107
00:14:56,00 --> 00:15:02,50
The teen stares into the camera with a stunned expression. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS108
00:14:59,00 --> 00:15:03,50
Phase Three. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS109
00:15:00,00 --> 00:15:05,50
Over Falsity of Confidence. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS110
00:15:07,00 --> 00:15:14,50
He plays an acoustic guitar while blowing a harmonica attached to a neck rack. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS111
00:15:11,00 --> 00:15:16,50
Phase Four: Fuck Yeah, Motherfucker. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS112
00:15:13,00 --> 00:15:22,50
The teen dances, rips the clothes from his closet, trashes a piano keyboard and then leans close to the camera. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS113
00:15:45,00 --> 00:15:49,50
The Captain glares at SOMEONE. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS114
00:16:42,00 --> 00:16:47,50
The Captain slaps the desk. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS115
00:16:53,00 --> 00:16:59,50
Later, as SOMEONE walks through the bullpen the lights cut out. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS116
00:16:56,00 --> 00:17:02,50
Passing the chapels few remaining pews he approaches the alter 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS117
00:16:59,00 --> 00:17:05,50
where a statue depicts Jesus reaching from the cross. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS118
00:17:02,00 --> 00:17:07,50
A dove in his outstretched hand. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS119
00:17:04,00 --> 00:17:08,50
SOMEONE kneels. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS120
00:17:54,00 --> 00:18:02,50
Behind him SOMEONE bites his fist and doubles over with laughter. The Captain opens his office window. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS121
00:18:18,00 --> 00:18:22,50
Now outside a home. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS122
00:18:35,00 --> 00:18:40,50
SOMEONE eyes a wall of his childhood portraits. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS123
00:18:46,00 --> 00:18:50,50
SOMEONE picks up a vase. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS124
00:19:50,00 --> 00:19:54,50
She answers the door. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS126
00:20:35,00 --> 00:20:43,50
In the morning, SOMEONE and SOMEONE wake to find SOMEONE's father using an elliptical machine at their feet. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS127
00:20:46,00 --> 00:20:51,50
Later they shave. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS128
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:08,50
Now the pickup bagged lunches with the names SOMEONE and Doug written in quotes. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS129
00:21:12,00 --> 00:21:16,50
SOMEONE eyes his shoulders. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS130
00:21:26,00 --> 00:21:30,50
They go outside. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS131
00:21:47,00 --> 00:21:52,50
SOMEONE eyes his hatchback. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS132
00:21:50,00 --> 00:21:58,50
Now, at a police impound a female officer walks them to a 1970s Camaro. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS133
00:22:03,00 --> 00:22:08,50
Now in the driver's seat SOMEONE revs the engine. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS134
00:22:08,00 --> 00:22:14,50
He drives toward SOMEONE who nimbly rolls over the hood and lands safely on the ground. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS135
00:22:14,00 --> 00:22:18,50
SOMEONE runs back to him. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS136
00:22:22,00 --> 00:22:29,50
As SOMEONE drives at him, SOMEONE slams up on the hood, then slides to the pavement. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS137
00:22:26,00 --> 00:22:31,50
His partner rushes out to him. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS138
00:22:30,00 --> 00:22:35,50
SOMEONE sprawls, unmoving. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS139
00:22:34,00 --> 00:22:41,50
Now, the Camaro pulls into a high school parking lot bustling with teens. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS140
00:22:45,00 --> 00:22:49,50
They pull into a handicapped spot. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS141
00:22:47,00 --> 00:22:54,50
In slow motion the undercover cops get out and sling their backpacks over one shoulder. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS142
00:22:52,00 --> 00:22:59,50
They notice every student around them wearing their backpacks strapped to both shoulders. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS143
00:22:58,00 --> 00:23:03,50
One teen sneers. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS144
00:23:13,00 --> 00:23:18,50
He eyes black clad teens. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS145
00:23:15,00 --> 00:23:20,50
He spots scrawny awkward kids. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS146
00:23:18,00 --> 00:23:23,50
He notices teens in Rockabilly clothes. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS147
00:23:22,00 --> 00:23:27,50
Other girls wear kooky Harajuku fashions. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS148
00:23:28,00 --> 00:23:37,50
Looking head SOMEONE stares. In slow-motion a fresh-faced blonde with a sunny smile rides a bicycle through the quad. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS149
00:23:36,00 --> 00:23:41,50
She arrives before a handsome boy. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS150
00:23:42,00 --> 00:23:47,50
He kisses her, then sees the newcomers. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS151
00:24:25,00 --> 00:24:29,50
SOMEONE punches him in the face. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS152
00:24:35,00 --> 00:24:39,50
A crowd gathers. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS153
00:24:51,00 --> 00:24:55,50
With the principal. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS154
00:25:26,00 --> 00:25:30,50
SOMEONE nods. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS155
00:25:35,00 --> 00:25:40,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS157
00:26:13,00 --> 00:26:17,50
Now in a drama class. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS158
00:26:30,00 --> 00:26:35,50
SOMEONE leans toward the pretty blonde. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS159
00:27:32,00 --> 00:27:38,50
She directs his gaze to the back of a chair. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS160
00:27:35,00 --> 00:27:43,50
Next to a sticker depicting poop with a halo, a hand-scrawled arrow points to a phone number. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS161
00:27:44,00 --> 00:27:48,50
He sends a text to the number. Looking for hook-up. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS163
00:28:17,00 --> 00:28:22,50
In a chemistry class. The red-haired teacher beams. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS164
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:44,50
The red-haired teacher and other students clap. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS165
00:29:07,00 --> 00:29:11,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS166
00:29:15,00 --> 00:29:20,50
SOMEONE gives a perplexed shake of the head. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS167
00:29:24,00 --> 00:29:30,50
Subtitles, French: The Language of Love. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS168
00:29:28,00 --> 00:29:33,50
The teacher arrives. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS169
00:29:30,00 --> 00:29:35,50
She gives him a quiz and winks flirtatiously. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS170
00:29:33,00 --> 00:29:39,50
Her gaze lingers on him as she steps away. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS171
00:29:36,00 --> 00:29:43,50
In drama, SOMEONE stands on a small stage facing the class. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS172
00:29:40,00 --> 00:29:48,50
He sways nervously and takes a deep breath as a keyboardist struggles to cue him in. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS173
00:29:45,00 --> 00:29:50,50
Smirking, SOMEONE tilts her head. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS174
00:30:11,00 --> 00:30:15,50
SOMEONE digs for his phone. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS175
00:30:14,00 --> 00:30:19,50
A text, meet at yearbook. Five minutes. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS177
00:30:24,00 --> 00:30:30,50
Taking the quiz SOMEONE reads a question. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS178
00:30:27,00 --> 00:30:36,50
He sees the multiple choice answers as, you're an idiot. No I'm not. Yeah you are dumbass. Fuck you quiz. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS179
00:30:34,00 --> 00:30:42,50
He circles the remaining answers at random then steps up behind the teacher to turn in his quiz. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS180
00:30:53,00 --> 00:30:58,50
SOMEONE gets a text from SOMEONE reading, hallway now. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS181
00:31:02,00 --> 00:31:06,50
She smiles coquettishly. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS182
00:31:14,00 --> 00:31:18,50
Now the two cops run down a hall. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS183
00:31:18,00 --> 00:31:24,50
Now they enter a darkened classroom with the window blinds drawn. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS184
00:31:21,00 --> 00:31:27,50
Stacks of old computers and other equipment fill the room. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS185
00:31:24,00 --> 00:31:32,50
Moving further inside the two undercover cops find the handsome, sensitive teen 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS186
00:31:29,00 --> 00:31:33,50
working alone at a computer. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS187
00:32:29,00 --> 00:32:35,50
A pencil case holds wafers depicting the haloed poop logo. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS188
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:55,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE who nods. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS189
00:32:53,00 --> 00:32:58,50
They each take a wafer sealed in a baggie. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS190
00:33:05,00 --> 00:33:11,50
The click the wafers together as if in a toast then pop them in their mouths. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS191
00:33:14,00 --> 00:33:19,50
Now they rush into a toilet stall. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS192
00:33:18,00 --> 00:33:22,50
They gag themselves. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS193
00:33:44,00 --> 00:33:50,50
They jam their fingers into each other's mouths and gag each other. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS194
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:53,50
An elderly janitor shuffling past pauses and looks on. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS195
00:33:57,00 --> 00:34:05,50
As the undercover cops gag each other again, the janitor turns and wearily shuffles away. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS196
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:21,50
In the hall they encounter a coach. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS197
00:34:24,00 --> 00:34:28,50
He takes SOMEONE's. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS198
00:34:33,00 --> 00:34:37,50
The coach eyes SOMEONE's physique. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS199
00:34:47,00 --> 00:34:52,50
SOMEONE raises his hand. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS200
00:34:59,00 --> 00:35:03,50
The couch swats at his reaching hand. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS201
00:35:09,00 --> 00:35:13,50
SOMEONE laughs. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS202
00:35:15,00 --> 00:35:22,50
Phase One: The Gigs. SOMEONE and SOMEONE laugh uncontrollably. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS204
00:35:20,00 --> 00:35:28,50
SOMEONE gives a spastic nod. Our view rapidly switches between the two giggling cops. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS205
00:35:25,00 --> 00:35:30,50
Phase Two: Tripping Major Ballsack. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS206
00:35:32,00 --> 00:35:36,50
The cops stare. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS207
00:35:39,00 --> 00:35:45,50
The coach's eyebrows crawl down his face and form a mustache. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS208
00:35:44,00 --> 00:35:50,50
SOMEONE sees a robotic furry kitty head on the coach's shoulders. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS209
00:35:50,00 --> 00:35:54,50
SOMEONE blows on the coach. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS210
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:05,50
The coach's head becomes an ice cream cone. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS211
00:36:10,00 --> 00:36:16,50
As the ice cream melts, SOMEONE sticks his tongue out. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS212
00:36:20,00 --> 00:36:24,50
SOMEONE curls his tongue. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS213
00:36:25,00 --> 00:36:30,50
The coach starts to give the pass back, then pauses. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS214
00:36:28,00 --> 00:36:37,50
As the undercover cops shake their heads, a rapid series of explosive and disturbing images fill our view. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS215
00:36:36,00 --> 00:36:39,50
In chemistry class. He writes and writes on the board.

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS219
00:37:01,00 --> 00:37:08,50
He signals to the keyboardist then struts and twirls proudly across the small stage. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS220
00:37:17,00 --> 00:37:21,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS221
00:37:42,00 --> 00:37:48,50
SOMEONE applauds delightedly. The drama teacher approaches SOMEONE. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS222
00:37:48,00 --> 00:37:54,50
He extends a hand, but SOMEONE pinches his face. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS223
00:37:52,00 --> 00:37:55,50

Well ahead of the others SOMEONE's teammate arrives and hands him the baton. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS231
00:38:25,00 --> 00:38:29,50
SOMEONE watches. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS232
00:38:29,00 --> 00:38:35,50
SOMEONE gets distracted by the others and slows. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS233
00:38:34,00 --> 00:38:39,50
He bats the batons out of their hands. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS234
00:38:44,00 --> 00:38:50,50
SOMEONE hurls the baton over the finish line and skips back and forth. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS235
00:38:49,00 --> 00:38:54,50
In the band room, SOMEONE spikes a trumpet. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS236
00:38:53,00 --> 00:38:58,50
He dives headfirst through a gong's ring stand. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS237
00:38:59,00 --> 00:39:08,50
On the tracks, SOMEONE holds the baton to his thrusting hips like a penis. The coach tries to take it away but he keeps his hips 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS240
00:39:10,00 --> 00:39:15,50

Now SOMEONE, the dealer, and two friends pass SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS245
00:39:31,00 --> 00:39:36,50
As they go, SOMEONE faces SOMEONE delightedly. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS246
00:39:38,00 --> 00:39:43,50
Now at headquarters, they show a perp chart. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS247
00:40:57,00 --> 00:41:07,50
Now at school, SOMEONE arrives at a classroom door colorfully labeled Science. He tries the handle then pounds on its frosted window. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS248
00:41:09,00 --> 00:41:14,50
As the door starts to open he forces his way in. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS249
00:41:13,00 --> 00:41:19,50
At the far end of the chemistry classroom SOMEONE sits with two other nerds. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS250
00:41:55,00 --> 00:42:03,50
SOMEONE sits down on a stool in front of SOMEONE, who tinkers with several cell phones. The other nerds go back to their game. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS251
00:42:35,00 --> 00:42:39,50
SOMEONE winks at him. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS252
00:42:41,00 --> 00:42:46,50
Grinning, SOMEONE winks and shrugs. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS254
00:43:31,00 --> 00:43:39,50
Now in his old room, SOMEONE nervously taps a cordless phone against his palm, then makes a call. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS255
00:43:36,00 --> 00:43:41,50
In her bedroom, SOMEONE answers her cell. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS256

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS265
00:45:53,00 --> 00:46:00,50
Now in his office, the Captain slowly chews a sandwich in his hands. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS266
00:45:57,00 --> 00:46:04,50
Holding SOMEONE and SOMEONE in a disapproving glare he points at them accusingly. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS267
00:46:28,00 --> 00:46:33,50
Now, SOMEONE's parents leave the house. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS268

00:47:05,00 --> 00:47:12,50
At the police station SOMEONE enters an evidence locker while SOMEONE keeps lookout. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS271
00:47:16,00 --> 00:47:23,50
Back at home, chips fill a bowl. A hand peels the evidence sticker off the pot. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS272
00:47:21,00 --> 00:47:27,50
The cops put a compost sign in a trash can, then set up a keg. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS273
00:47:24,00 --> 00:47:33,50
A CD reads, Brads Super Awesome Party Mix. The lights dim and a colorful spinning globe switches on. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS274
00:47:43,00 --> 00:47:48,50
They each do a shot. SOMEONE spits his out. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS275
00:47:46,00 --> 00:47:52,50
Now SOMEONE and his partner open the door to find the nerds on their stoop.

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS289
00:49:52,00 --> 00:49:58,50
Listening, SOMEONE bursts back in on the nerds, hitting SOMEONE with the door. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS290
00:50:05,00 --> 00:50:11,50
Downstairs three tough looking teens enter and strut toward SOMEONE and SOMEONE.

SOMEONE cocks his head, then turns away. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS337

Now, SOMEONE joins SOMEONE in the yearbook room. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS338
00:56:24,00 --> 00:56:29,50
SOMEONE sends him off with a paper bag. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS339
00:56:26,00 --> 00:56:32,50
Later, HFS wafers dump out on the Captain’s desk. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS340
00:56:31,00 --> 00:56:41,50
As SOMEONE stands by glumly, the Captain hands SOMEONE a role of cash then sips his coffee peevishly. SOMEONE takes the cash to SOMEONE. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS341

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS345
00:57:16,00 --> 00:57:22,50
Then run to a safe distance. The bottle explodes. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS346
00:57:27,00 --> 00:57:47,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE deface a police car. SOMEONE sends SOMEONE a message featuring a woman in a slutty Peter Pan costume. It reads, "My Peter Pan Costume. Too revealing?" SOMEONE responds, "Try something manlier," and includes a photo of a man in green spandex with a giant fake penis. Now in a show store. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS347
00:58:05,00 --> 00:58:09,50

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS352
00:58:42,00 --> 00:58:46,50

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS360
00:59:52,00 --> 00:59:58,50
SOMEONE gives her a kiss but she pulls away and hugs him. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS361
01:00:00,00 --> 01:00:08,50
Now in a humble house, the three nerds play music as SOMEONE arrives with energy drinks. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS362
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:19,50
On his patio SOMEONE plays guitar. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS363
01:00:28,00 --> 01:00:32,50
With the nerds. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS365
01:00:44,00 --> 01:00:48,50
In the house a phone lights up. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS367
01:00:49,00 --> 01:00:56,50
They listen eagerly. Now SOMEONE wanders into the house with the beer. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS368
01:00:53,00 --> 01:00:58,50
He spots a laptop on a desk and opens it. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS369
01:00:56,00 --> 01:01:03,50
Bringing up an email account he finds several messages from cooldeets88.

01:03:44,00 --> 01:03:48,50
SOMEONE smiles warmly. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS376
01:03:46,00 --> 01:03:52,50
As she gazes into his eyes, SOMEONE's grin fades. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS377
01:03:49,00 --> 01:03:56,50
Her expression tender, SOMEONE leans her lips toward his. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS378
01:03:54,00 --> 01:03:58,50
He shakes her hand. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS379
01:04:01,00 --> 01:04:07,50
SOMEONE and the others come in and sit around them. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS380
01:04:38,00 --> 01:04:42,50
SOMEONE turns it off. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS381
01:04:40,00 --> 01:04:49,50
He flings a throwing star into the Zod posters face. Now at his desk in the bullpen SOMEONE laughs. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS382
01:04:52,00 --> 01:04:59,50
Sitting tensely behind him SOMEONE opens his desk drawer, then slams it. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS383
01:04:57,00 --> 01:05:01,50
SOMEONE and her partner come in.

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS387
01:05:39,00 --> 01:05:44,50

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS388
01:05:52,00 --> 01:05:56,50
They reach their car. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS389
01:05:56,00 --> 01:06:03,50

He glances nervously at Ms. SOMEONE. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS396
01:07:09,00 --> 01:07:16,50
The window behind her shows SOMEONE and his black gay friend furtively carrying a piñata. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS397
01:07:17,00 --> 01:07:21,50
In the dressing room. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS398
01:07:56,00 --> 01:08:02,50
Outside, SOMEONE and his friend drive off. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS399
01:08:03,00 --> 01:08:14,50
SOMEONE slides over the Camaros hood then gets in with his partner. He starts the engine. The revving vintage car starts to backup then lurches to a halt. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS401
01:08:14,00 --> 01:08:18,50
It sports a boot. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS402
01:08:20,00 --> 01:08:24,50
SOMEONE turns. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS403
01:08:26,00 --> 01:08:30,50
They rush to the student Driver's car. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS404
01:08:30,00 --> 01:08:37,50
They ignore the instructor and get in behind the twin steering wheels. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS405
01:08:37,00 --> 01:08:48,50
Now, SOMEONE's maroon sedan arrives at a highway underpass where the biker gang, the One-Percenter's awaits the young dealer and his friend. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS406
01:08:45,00 --> 01:08:50,50
Near a rusted out wreck across the lot 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS407
01:08:47,00 --> 01:08:52,50
The Driver's Ed car rolls to a stop. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS408
01:08:49,00 --> 01:08:54,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch the deal go down. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS409

The dealer's handover the piñata. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS410
01:09:18,00 --> 01:09:24,50
The guys duck. SOMEONE pulls SOMEONE's head toward his lap. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS411
01:09:22,00 --> 01:09:27,50
One by one the bikers ride off on their choppers. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS412
01:09:40,00 --> 01:09:46,50
As the last of the bikers rides off, SOMEONE rises from SOMEONE's lap. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS413
01:09:49,00 --> 01:09:56,50
At a stoplight, the gang leader idles at the front of the pack. The Driver's Ed car pulls up behind them. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS414
01:10:03,00 --> 01:10:09,50
SOMEONE steps on the brake and the car stops short again. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS415
01:10:16,00 --> 01:10:21,50
SOMEONE stomps the accelerator, then hammer fists his groin. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS416
01:10:18,00 --> 01:10:26,50
As SOMEONE recoils, the car rams the bearded biker's rear tire. Knocking him onto the hood. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS417
01:10:36,00 --> 01:10:43,50
He rips the student driver sign off the roof and bashes it over the hood. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS418
01:10:47,00 --> 01:10:59,50
As he jumps up and down on the hood his cohorts get off their bikes and watch. SOMEONE observes an instruction card, before you drive fasten seatbelt, check mirrors, hands on ten and two. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS419
01:10:56,00 --> 01:11:03,50
The car peels out dropping the biker and knocking over the motorcycles. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS420
01:11:05,00 --> 01:11:09,50
They blow through a red light. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS421
01:11:06,00 --> 01:11:12,50
The bikers get back on the motorcycles and speed after them. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS422
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:16,50
The leader weaves through traffic with the piñata strapped to his sissy bar. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS423
01:11:14,00 --> 01:11:18,50
The bikers gain on them. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS424
01:11:17,00 --> 01:11:22,50
They slap at each other’s hands. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS425
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:30,50
Heading up a clogged freeway onramp they jam the breaks, stopping an inch shy of a station wagon full of kids. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS426
01:11:30,00 --> 01:11:34,50
SOMEONE flees. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS427
01:11:33,00 --> 01:11:38,50
SOMEONE spots him running away. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS428
01:11:37,00 --> 01:11:41,50
SOMEONE catches up with him. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS429

He spots a sports car. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS430
01:11:53,00 --> 01:11:58,50
SOMEONE head-butts the driver. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS431
01:11:57,00 --> 01:12:05,50
SOMEONE pulls him out then gets behind the wheel. A light turns green and he speeds on to the freeway. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS433
01:12:12,00 --> 01:12:27,50
A biker pulls out a handgun and takes aim. Using a tennis racket, SOMEONE hits a golf ball into his head. The biker wipes out into a truck, busting open its side gate and spilling flammable propane tanks onto the pavement. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS434
01:12:24,00 --> 01:12:29,50
One breaks open, spewing gas. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS435
01:12:34,00 --> 01:12:39,50
Back at the school auditorium. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS437
01:12:54,00 --> 01:12:59,50
they jump out and run on foot. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS438
01:12:57,00 --> 01:13:02,50
SOMEONE gets a text from SOMEONE, "Where the hell are you?" 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS439
01:13:03,00 --> 01:13:10,50
SOMEONE replies, "I'll be there fairy soon." Followed by emoticons. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS440
01:13:08,00 --> 01:13:13,50
SOMEONE leaps over the top of a stopped car. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS441
01:13:14,00 --> 01:13:18,50
He pulls the driver out. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS442
01:13:23,00 --> 01:13:29,50
They drive off in her pink Volkswagen Beetle toward a bridge. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS443
01:13:31,00 --> 01:13:38,50
As the Beetle rides up alongside a tanker truck, one of the bikers gains on them. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS444
01:13:37,00 --> 01:13:43,50
The vehicles reach the center of the bridge over a river. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS445
01:13:44,00 --> 01:13:51,50
SOMEONE tosses out a sunshade which wraps around the biker's face. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS446
01:13:49,00 --> 01:13:55,50
Firing wildly he shoots holes through the tanker. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS447
01:13:52,00 --> 01:13:58,50
He overtakes the rig and falls off his bike. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS448
01:13:55,00 --> 01:14:00,50
The truck runs over his legs. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS449
01:13:57,00 --> 01:14:05,50
The tanker slows to a stop gushing oil and fuel as sparks fly from the tumbling motorcycle. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS450
01:14:06,00 --> 01:14:12,50
We dramatically zoom back from the tanker ad glide above the truss bridge. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS451
01:14:16,00 --> 01:14:24,50
Yielding a silver revolver, the gang leader pulls up alongside the Beetle and shoots out the driver side window. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS452
01:14:22,00 --> 01:14:27,50
SOMEONE swerves into another traffic lane. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS453
01:14:30,00 --> 01:14:35,50
SOMEONE finds a four-shot pistol. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS454
01:14:32,00 --> 01:14:40,50
He glances at his partner. The gang leader cuts off a sedan and rides up alongside them again. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS455
01:14:40,00 --> 01:14:45,50
SOMEONE aims out the driver side window. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS456
01:14:49,00 --> 01:14:56,50
The gang leader takes aim. SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE's pistol and pulls the trigger himself. The piñata bursts. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS458
01:14:55,00 --> 01:15:02,50
As the gang leader swerves, a truck hauling chickens blocks his path. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS459
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:05,50
He wipes out and his bike slides underneath the vehicle. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS460
01:15:02,00 --> 01:15:08,50
The truck explodes and chicken feathers fly into the Beetle. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS461
01:15:22,00 --> 01:15:29,50
The return to Sagan High and SOMEONE parks crookedly in a space. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS462
01:15:54,00 --> 01:15:58,50
SOMEONE runs off. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS463
01:15:56,00 --> 01:16:02,50
In the auditorium the audience watches SOMEONE perform with the understudy. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS464
01:16:04,00 --> 01:16:08,50
SOMEONE runs on stage. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS465
01:16:17,00 --> 01:16:24,50
He takes flying harness ropes off French and hooks them to his own costume. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS466
01:16:35,00 --> 01:16:45,50
SOMEONE sneaks past stagehands. As SOMEONE rises off of the stage SOMEONE falls of a fake boulder and grabs on to his dangling partner. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS467
01:16:45,00 --> 01:16:49,50
The stagehands struggle with the ropes. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS468
01:16:50,00 --> 01:16:54,50
They swing before the crowd. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS469
01:16:58,00 --> 01:17:04,50
SOMEONE falls hard on a fake boulder then tumbles on to the stage. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS470
01:17:02,00 --> 01:17:07,50
Upside down, SOMEONE swings past SOMEONE. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS471
01:17:07,00 --> 01:17:15,50
The stagehands lose control of the ropes and SOMEONE crashes. SOMEONE and SOMEONE get to their feet. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS472
01:17:15,00 --> 01:17:26,50
As SOMEONE charges, SOMEONE leaps over him with the aid of the stagehands working the lines. SOMEONE picks up one of the fake boulders and chucks it at his partner. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS473
01:17:23,00 --> 01:17:31,50
He leaps straight up then dangles over the stage with SOMEONE clinging to his leg. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS474
01:17:37,00 --> 01:17:43,50
He throws glitter in SOMEONE's eyes. The stagehands drop them. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS475
01:17:40,00 --> 01:17:49,50
As they wrestle, the principal enters the auditorium with the drama teacher. They hurry on stage and break up the fight. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS476
01:17:48,00 --> 01:17:54,50
The coach laughs over a girls shoulder as he munches on Doritos. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS477
01:17:56,00 --> 01:18:02,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE share a disheartened gaze. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS478
01:18:02,00 --> 01:18:07,50
In the audience SOMEONE applauds over his head. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS479
01:18:04,00 --> 01:18:10,50
As the curtains close SOMEONE paws at SOMEONE. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS482
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:15,50

She leaves and he shakes his head. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS548
01:24:36,00 --> 01:24:42,50

The bikers riddle the DEA agents with bullet holes and they collapse side by side. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS584
01:31:20,00 --> 01:31:26,50
In the bathroom stall, the red-haired nerd grabs his headphones. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS585

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS590
01:31:48,00 --> 01:31:52,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE bleed out. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS591
01:31:56,00 --> 01:32:03,50
SOMEONE listens in. SOMEONE fires then rolls behind the couch and faces his partner. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS592
01:32:25,00 --> 01:32:30,50
Behind the couch SOMEONE and SOMEONE share a look. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS593
01:32:28,00 --> 01:32:33,50
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE lie dead on the floor,

In slow motion, SOMEONE rises and leaps over the couch. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS598
01:33:00,00 --> 01:33:09,50
Piñata confetti flurries around him as he dives sideways, shooting a mohawked biker in the chest. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS599
01:33:07,00 --> 01:33:11,50
The thug collapses. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS600
01:33:08,00 --> 01:33:14,50
Behind SOMEONE, SOMEONE climbs over the couch. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS601
01:33:12,00 --> 01:33:17,50
He falls clumsily out of view. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS602
01:33:18,00 --> 01:33:25,50
Getting up, he aims his gun at a departing biker with a topknot braid. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS604
01:33:24,00 --> 01:33:29,50
Puckering his lips squeamishly, He throws the gun instead. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS605
01:33:26,00 --> 01:33:32,50
It hits the base of the biker's neck and he turns. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS607
01:33:31,00 --> 01:33:36,50
As he takes aim at SOMEONE, SOMEONE rises from the floor.

01:33:33,00 --> 01:33:39,50
He shoots the biker multiple times in the chest. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS609
01:33:36,00 --> 01:33:41,50
The thug lurches back. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS610
01:33:38,00 --> 01:33:44,50
His braid twirling as he twists around and falls. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS611
01:33:41,00 --> 01:33:50,50
His gaze steely, SOMEONE lowers his gun. The cops step on SOMEONE's discarded fake nose as they races from the sweet. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS612
01:33:50,00 --> 01:33:54,50
SOMEONE vomits on him. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS613
01:33:53,00 --> 01:33:58,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE exit an elevator. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS614
01:33:57,00 --> 01:34:04,50
Now a slideshow of snapshots holds the attention of sentimental prom guests. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS615

SOMEONE resumes the gunfight. The silver and black limos swerve between lane barriers and speed through oncoming traffic. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS639
01:36:12,00 --> 01:36:16,50
They veer back into the flow. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS640
01:36:15,00 --> 01:36:22,50
Following them into an alley, the white limo stops. SOMEONE shoves SOMEONE out. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS641
01:36:27,00 --> 01:36:33,50
SOMEONE wrenches the wheel, taking the limo back to the main road. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS642
01:37:01,00 --> 01:37:15,50
He puts gunpowder from the shells and two lithium batteries from SOMEONE's digital camera in a liquor bottle. He stands in the sunroof and makes a perfect quarterback pass. Spiraling, the bottle drops through SOMEONE's sunroof. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS643
01:37:12,00 --> 01:37:21,50
Meanwhile SOMEONE sideswipes a parked car. As SOMEONE comes to, a busted hydrant spouts water. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS645
01:37:23,00 --> 01:37:31,50
The black limo explodes and rolls into a fuel tank. A second blast flips it like a tiddlywink. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS646
01:37:34,00 --> 01:37:42,50
As the white limo halts, SOMEONE gets out of the stalled silver one and grabs SOMEONE by the arm. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS647
01:37:41,00 --> 01:37:47,50
The cops leave their car passing a charred corpse. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS648
01:37:45,00 --> 01:37:49,50
They aim their guns at the corrupt coach. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS649
01:37:50,00 --> 01:37:55,50
As SOMEONE draws, SOMEONE pulls his trigger. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS650
01:37:56,00 --> 01:38:01,50
He uses SOMEONE as a human shield. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS651
01:38:07,00 --> 01:38:11,50
SOMEONE blithers in the car. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS652
01:38:12,00 --> 01:38:17,50
As he drags her off, SOMEONE pleads. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS653
01:38:15,00 --> 01:38:22,50
The coach fires at SOMEONE but SOMEONE dives between them taking the hits. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS654
01:38:33,00 --> 01:38:41,50
Shoulder bleeding, SOMEONE reveals the other shot mashed into his bullet proof vest. SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS655
01:38:39,00 --> 01:38:44,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE and steadies his aim. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS656
01:38:41,00 --> 01:38:46,50
A helicopter hovers overhead. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS657
01:38:43,00 --> 01:38:49,50
SOMEONE remembers being gun-shy in the park. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS658
01:38:46,00 --> 01:38:50,50
Then in the Peter Pan car chase. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS659
01:38:48,00 --> 01:38:55,50
As SOMEONE elbows SOMEONE in the gut and escapes, SOMEONE recalls his insecure past. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS660
01:38:53,00 --> 01:38:58,50
He remembers Korean Jesus. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS661
01:38:57,00 --> 01:39:02,50
SOMEONE fires hitting SOMEONE in the groin. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS663
01:39:07,00 --> 01:39:12,50
SOMEONE joins him in making the arrest. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS664
01:40:03,00 --> 01:40:09,50
The two guys gaze into each other's eyes. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS665
01:40:08,00 --> 01:40:17,50
SOMEONE nods tearfully. They jump up and slap palms. SOMEONE clutches his bleeding shoulder. SOMEONE massages his own hand. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS666
01:40:29,00 --> 01:40:33,50
It lies in the street. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS667
01:40:35,00 --> 01:40:40,50
Handcuffed SOMEONE tries to pick it up with his mouth. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS668
01:40:39,00 --> 01:40:47,50
Later, as emergency crews work the scene, a cop takes SOMEONE away. A bandaged SOMEONE shouts after the teen. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS669
01:40:45,00 --> 01:40:49,50
SOMEONE sits by SOMEONE. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS670
01:40:49,00 --> 01:40:57,50
SOMEONE sits glumly in the back of an ambulance as a SOMEONE checks on her. She perks her head up as SOMEONE comes over. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS671
01:41:40,00 --> 01:41:45,50
She cracks a smile. SOMEONE extends a hand. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS672
01:41:45,00 --> 01:41:51,50
Shaking it, SOMEONE grins. Then cranes in fast for a kiss. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS673
01:41:49,00 --> 01:41:54,50
SOMEONE melts into the lip lock. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS674
01:41:51,00 --> 01:41:56,50
Looking on, SOMEONE chuckles approvingly. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS675
01:41:53,00 --> 01:41:58,50
The SOMEONE stands by uncomfortably. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS676
01:41:59,00 --> 01:42:03,50
He steps away. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS677
01:42:01,00 --> 01:42:07,50
Rejoining SOMEONE spread his arms wide in a proud strut. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS678
01:42:10,00 --> 01:42:14,50
They head off. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS679
01:42:14,00 --> 01:42:19,50
Daytime, they burst into the bullpen. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS680
01:42:19,00 --> 01:42:27,50
SOMEONE high fives a cop while SOMEONE dips SOMEONE in a kiss. The Captain smirks tolerantly. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS681
01:42:24,00 --> 01:42:30,50
As his two prodigal agents hug him, he shrugs them off. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS682
01:42:35,00 --> 01:42:40,50
He presents a framed arrest report. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS683
01:42:38,00 --> 01:42:43,50
He deflects a second hug. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS684
01:43:01,00 --> 01:43:07,50
As we cut to black, words appear, The End. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS685
01:43:04,00 --> 01:43:12,50
Now, as scenes of violence and debauchery play interspersed with clips from the movie, titles appear. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS687
01:43:11,00 --> 01:43:17,50
A rolled $20 SOMEONE sucks up a line of coke. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS692
01:43:26,00 --> 01:43:35,50
At a desk, a writer types rapidly then pulls the paper from his typewriter. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS709
01:44:35,00 --> 01:44:41,50
The front of a sweatshirt unzips revealing glittering skin underneath. 

21_JUMP_STREET_DVS711
01:44:41,00 --> 01:44:48,50
Two hands clasp in a soul brother shake and we see a compilation of explosions. Korean Jesus looks at us.
