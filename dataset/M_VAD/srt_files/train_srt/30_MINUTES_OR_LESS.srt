30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS15
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:47,50
He takes out their pizzas. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS16
00:03:28,00 --> 00:03:33,50
He starts for his car, then turns back. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS17
00:03:37,00 --> 00:03:41,50
He stuffs their cash in his back pocket. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS18
00:03:39,00 --> 00:03:46,50
Now the Mustang drives an empty road lined with abandoned warehouses. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS19
00:03:44,00 --> 00:03:50,50
The shaggy-haired driver drums on his steering wheel with his thumb. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS20
00:03:47,00 --> 00:03:53,50
The Mustang crosses a truss bridge over a river. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS21
00:03:50,00 --> 00:03:59,50
That night sitting on a stoop, the shaggy-haired young man opens a bottle of beer, tosses the cap and takes a sip. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS22
00:03:57,00 --> 00:04:06,50
He notices a scruffy Indian-American guy alone in the passenger seat of a silver car, then lowers his gaze and sips his beer. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS23
00:04:14,00 --> 00:04:20,50
A young girl lifts her head from his lap and picks something from her mouth. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS24
00:04:17,00 --> 00:04:24,50
She cradles his dark sideburns and kisses him passionately on the lips. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS25
00:04:41,00 --> 00:04:45,50
He sees the delivery guy. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS26
00:05:36,00 --> 00:05:41,50
Now a watermelon explodes. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS27
00:05:38,00 --> 00:05:43,50
Two guys celebrate in a scrapyard. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS28
00:05:42,00 --> 00:05:47,50
SOMEONE holds a crossbow. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS29
00:06:13,00 --> 00:06:22,50
He pulls up another watermelon. Now in a home screening room SOMEONE and his friend watch Friday the 13th Part III in 3D. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS30
00:06:21,00 --> 00:06:25,50
He pawns the air. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS31
00:06:27,00 --> 00:06:31,50
He gets up and thrusts his hips. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS32
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:36,50
His friend joins in. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS33
00:06:36,00 --> 00:06:40,50
A stern older man enters. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS34
00:06:41,00 --> 00:06:45,50
The lights switch on. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS35
00:07:28,00 --> 00:07:34,50
He picks up a plate, but the Major grabs it. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS36
00:07:40,00 --> 00:07:44,50
SOMEONE dumps his 3D glasses. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS37
00:07:43,00 --> 00:07:47,50
He heads out. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS38
00:07:51,00 --> 00:08:03,50
He and SOMEONE exit a mansion. Various vehicles sit in the driveway, including an RV and a boat. SOMEONE spots a truck emblazoned with a bald eagle surrounded by stars and stripes. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS39
00:08:03,00 --> 00:08:07,50
SOMEONE spits on it. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS40
00:08:07,00 --> 00:08:13,50
At night, the Mustang parks at a curb outside their store. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS41
00:08:11,00 --> 00:08:19,50
Inside the uniformed delivery guys carries a pizza through an aisle of colorful vases and decorations. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS42
00:08:17,00 --> 00:08:24,50
He gazes at a young Indian-American woman fixing an arrangement of white flowers, 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS43
00:08:21,00 --> 00:08:27,50
then notices his own reflection in a metallic balloon. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS44
00:08:25,00 --> 00:08:29,50
Using his car key, he pops it. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS45
00:08:28,00 --> 00:08:32,50
The young woman flinches. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS46
00:08:49,00 --> 00:08:56,50
Now they eat pizza at a display table set for an elegant dinner. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS47
00:10:13,00 --> 00:10:18,50
At a strip club, SOMEONE gets a lap dance. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS48
00:11:08,00 --> 00:11:12,50
He takes a sip of beer. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS49
00:11:16,00 --> 00:11:22,50
She rips off her top baring her breasts. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS50
00:11:20,00 --> 00:11:24,50
She pinches her nipples. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS51
00:11:31,00 --> 00:11:36,50
She breathes on SOMEONE's crotch. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS52
00:11:51,00 --> 00:11:56,50
She scratches his goatee chin. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS53
00:11:58,00 --> 00:12:03,50
SOMEONE looks at her supple breasts. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS54
00:12:03,00 --> 00:12:07,50
She puts his hand on them. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS55
00:12:07,00 --> 00:12:11,50
He nods. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS56
00:12:10,00 --> 00:12:19,50
Now in an apartment the shaggy-haired delivery guy grabs a Rolling Rock from a refrigerator, then enters the living room. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS57
00:12:18,00 --> 00:12:22,50
He throws the bottle cap at SOMEONE. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS58

SOMEONE grabs a remote and shuts off the TV. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS59
00:13:11,00 --> 00:13:16,50
SOMEONE turns off the TV again. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS60
00:13:50,00 --> 00:13:53,50
He stands. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS61
00:14:27,00 --> 00:14:31,50
They both sit back down. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS62
00:14:51,00 --> 00:14:56,50
SOMEONE tackles his friend and they wrestle on the floor. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS63
00:14:59,00 --> 00:15:04,50
He briefly gets the upper hand, but SOMEONE throws him off. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS64
00:15:04,00 --> 00:15:09,50
He repeatedly punches SOMEONE on the hip. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS65
00:15:07,00 --> 00:15:12,50
SOMEONE gets him in a chokehold. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS66
00:15:17,00 --> 00:15:21,50
He releases him. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS67
00:15:29,00 --> 00:15:33,50
He stumbles to his feet. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS68
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:48,50
He flips the bird and leaves. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS69
00:15:50,00 --> 00:15:56,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE tend to a backyard swimming pool. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS70
00:16:11,00 --> 00:16:17,50
SOMEONE flings leaves across the yard, then gathers more in his skimmer. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS72
00:18:39,00 --> 00:18:44,50
He sips a takeout soda. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS73
00:18:50,00 --> 00:18:54,50
In a garage. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS74
00:19:19,00 --> 00:19:25,50
He grabs a component from a cluttered workbench. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS76
00:20:18,00 --> 00:20:24,50
On TV the bearded pizza man holds up a slice to his mouth. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS77
00:20:26,00 --> 00:20:32,50
At work the delivery guy assembles pizza boxes. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS78
00:20:32,00 --> 00:20:36,50
The boss gives him an address. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS79
00:20:50,00 --> 00:20:58,50
The delivery guy goes to his car, starts the timer and drives out of the Vito's Pizza parking lot. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS80
00:21:00,00 --> 00:21:06,50
He taps his steering wheel with his thumb as he cruises an empty street. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS81
00:21:04,00 --> 00:21:09,50
The timer counts down to zero. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS82
00:21:08,00 --> 00:21:17,50
The Mustang rounds a darkened corner and stops halfway through the gate of a chain link fence with an address number on a sign. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS83
00:21:16,00 --> 00:21:25,50
The delivery guy checks it against his order ticket then pulls the rest of the way through and drives down a long dirt lot. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS84
00:21:25,00 --> 00:21:31,50
His car rolls through the junkyard between mounds of scrap metal. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS85
00:21:31,00 --> 00:21:37,50
Across a dirt clearing lies a shed with lights on inside. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS86
00:21:37,00 --> 00:21:44,50
Parking nearby the delivery guy steps out with the pizza and slams his door. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS87
00:21:43,00 --> 00:21:47,50
He marches up to the shed. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS89
00:21:57,00 --> 00:22:01,50
The customer steps out in a gorilla mask. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS90
00:22:05,00 --> 00:22:11,50
A second guy in a chimpanzee mask waddles out with a lead pipe.

00:22:20,00 --> 00:22:25,50
SOMEONE tackles the delivery guy. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS92
00:22:25,00 --> 00:22:32,50
His masked assailant covers his nose and mouth with a white rag until he passes out. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS93
00:22:29,00 --> 00:22:36,50
SOMEONE approaches with a revolver. He takes off his gorilla mask. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS95
00:22:38,00 --> 00:22:43,50
A blurry view shows the masked kidnapper. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS96
00:22:43,00 --> 00:22:48,50
Duct tape covers the victim's mouth. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS97
00:22:45,00 --> 00:22:49,50
SOMEONE checks his wallet. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS98
00:22:56,00 --> 00:23:02,50
SOMEONE sees a wired vest underneath his green army jacket. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS99
00:23:18,00 --> 00:23:23,50
SOMEONE tries to get up. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS100
00:23:22,00 --> 00:23:27,50
SOMEONE does some clumsy jump kicks. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS101
00:25:09,00 --> 00:25:15,50
As he starts a timer on the vest the image briefly freezes. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS102
00:25:56,00 --> 00:26:00,50
The teddy bear explodes. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS103
00:26:04,00 --> 00:26:09,50
SOMEONE unties SOMEONE. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS104
00:26:19,00 --> 00:26:23,50
He shoots the ground around SOMEONE's feet. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS105
00:26:22,00 --> 00:26:26,50
SOMEONE stumbles to his car. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS106
00:26:36,00 --> 00:26:40,50
SOMEONE takes off his mask. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS107
00:26:48,00 --> 00:26:53,50
SOMEONE rips off his mask. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS108
00:27:06,00 --> 00:27:11,50
Now a red dot moves around the map. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS109
00:27:30,00 --> 00:27:34,50
SOMEONE barges into the classroom. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS110
00:27:34,00 --> 00:27:38,50
SOMEONE approaches him. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS111
00:27:43,00 --> 00:27:48,50
They step out to the hall. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS112
00:28:03,00 --> 00:28:08,50
SOMEONE unzips his jacket to reveal the vest. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS113
00:29:33,00 --> 00:29:41,50
Now a sleek black car pulls around the strip club where the brunette dancer waits by a backdoor. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS114
00:29:39,00 --> 00:29:46,50
A goateed thug with a shaved head and a tattoo on his neck steps out. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS115
00:29:46,00 --> 00:29:51,50
She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS116
00:30:15,00 --> 00:30:21,50
She climbs in his car, giving him a view of her butt. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS117
00:30:49,00 --> 00:30:54,50
SOMEONE's sitting on a toilet fully clothed. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS118
00:31:06,00 --> 00:31:12,50
He crosses to a window and spots a van outside. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS119
00:31:25,00 --> 00:31:30,50
SOMEONE rolls his eyes then sits on SOMEONE's couch. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS120
00:31:32,00 --> 00:31:36,50
SOMEONE slaps him. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS122
00:32:41,00 --> 00:32:45,50
Now at a store. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS123
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:54,50
They reach an aisle of toy guns. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS124
00:32:56,00 --> 00:33:00,50
SOMEONE aims at SOMEONE. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS125
00:33:09,00 --> 00:33:15,50
Outside the Family Dollar store SOMEONE and SOMEONE wait in the van. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS126
00:33:13,00 --> 00:33:20,50
SOMEONE bops his head to the song, SOMEONE pops out the cassette. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS127
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:53,50
He notices a commercial property for lease in a strip mall. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS128
00:34:35,00 --> 00:34:38,50
Meanwhile at a register. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS129
00:34:37,00 --> 00:34:41,50
The cashier scans the items. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS130
00:34:55,00 --> 00:35:00,50
SOMEONE puts another item on the checkout counter. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS131
00:35:43,00 --> 00:35:48,50
Now SOMEONE spray paints a gun black. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS132
00:36:49,00 --> 00:36:54,50
The Mustang abruptly skids to a stop. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS133
00:37:21,00 --> 00:37:26,50
Pulling back out, SOMEONE almost hits a passing truck. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS134
00:37:27,00 --> 00:37:35,50
The Mustang drives off. Later, SOMEONE leads SOMEONE around the side of a garage and tries a door. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS136
00:37:37,00 --> 00:37:43,50
They peer through a cracked open window at a maroon Datsun inside. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS137
00:37:46,00 --> 00:37:54,50
SOMEONE hands him the shopping bag, then slides the window up and knocks over a few plastic bottles. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS138
00:37:58,00 --> 00:38:04,50
He awkwardly climbs through the window and falls over a workbench onto the floor. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS139
00:38:03,00 --> 00:38:07,50
SOMEONE peeks inside. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS140

SOMEONE lets him into the garage. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS141
00:38:12,00 --> 00:38:18,50
SOMEONE sets down the bag, then checks items dangling from a shelf. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS142
00:38:22,00 --> 00:38:29,50
SOMEONE crosses to a counter and peeks inside a green bag. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS143
00:38:26,00 --> 00:38:31,50
SOMEONE searches a couple of cluttered desk drawers. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS144
00:38:29,00 --> 00:38:34,50
SOMEONE checks inside the car under a visor. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS145
00:38:33,00 --> 00:38:37,50
SOMEONE looks up from a cabinet. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS146

SOMEONE peers out a window and spots an older man exiting the house. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS147
00:38:45,00 --> 00:38:49,50
He tosses SOMEONE a ski mask. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS148
00:38:49,00 --> 00:38:56,50
Just as they SOMEONE their ski masks, Mr. Fisher enters. SOMEONE takes out a toy gun. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS149
00:38:55,00 --> 00:38:59,50
SOMEONE fixes his mask. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS151
00:39:45,00 --> 00:39:50,50
Mr. Fisher presses a button and the garage door rises. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS152
00:40:00,00 --> 00:40:06,50
SOMEONE gets in after SOMEONE. They each wave. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS153
00:40:06,00 --> 00:40:13,50
The Datsun speeds across the driveway and bottoms out as it turns onto the street. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS154
00:40:10,00 --> 00:40:16,50
SOMEONE peels of his mask. SOMEONE buckles his seatbelt. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS155
00:40:28,00 --> 00:40:33,50
SOMEONE shifts gears. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS156
00:41:11,00 --> 00:41:16,50
At Vito's the Datsun parks by a dumpster. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS157
00:41:25,00 --> 00:41:32,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch from inside the van as SOMEONE runs past the entrance. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS158
00:41:51,00 --> 00:41:55,50
SOMEONE steps out. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS159
00:41:56,00 --> 00:42:04,50
Now SOMEONE sprints across a bridge, crossing the river in his buttoned up green army jacket. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS160
00:42:01,00 --> 00:42:09,50
As he reaches the other side, SOMEONE arrives at the start of the bridge and stops to catch his breath. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS161
00:42:06,00 --> 00:42:13,50
SOMEONE talks on his cell as he runs into the building with the flower store. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS162
00:42:21,00 --> 00:42:29,50
SOMEONE staggers up the front steps. Now SOMEONE steps onto the roof. SOMEONE stands on the opposite side.

00:43:28,00 --> 00:43:32,50
He hurries past SOMEONE to the door. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS164
00:43:39,00 --> 00:43:42,50
In the stairwell, SOMEONE talks on the phone. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS165
00:43:47,00 --> 00:43:51,50
As SOMEONE enters SOMEONE casually turns away. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS167
00:43:55,00 --> 00:43:58,50
It shows Vito's Pizza place.  

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS168
00:44:28,00 --> 00:44:34,50
Now SOMEONE enters Vito's Pizza and marches up to his boss. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS169
00:44:37,00 --> 00:44:41,50
He storms off. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS170
00:44:43,00 --> 00:44:49,50
In the Datsun SOMEONE chugs a 5-hour Energy shot while eating a cheeseburger. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS171
00:44:47,00 --> 00:44:51,50
SOMEONE returns. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS172
00:45:02,00 --> 00:45:07,50
He shakes an empty bottle. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS173
00:45:09,00 --> 00:45:17,50
The maroon Datsun drives off and the old beige van follows. Later across the street from the bank. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS174
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:06,50
They pull down their masks and barge inside. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS175
00:46:10,00 --> 00:46:15,50
SOMEONE approaches the tellers. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS176
00:46:18,00 --> 00:46:23,50
SOMEONE aims at a security guard. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS177
00:46:22,00 --> 00:46:26,50
SOMEONE eyes a guy in a green shirt. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS178
00:46:38,00 --> 00:46:44,50
The guard slides his gun directly over to a mom. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS179
00:46:49,00 --> 00:46:56,50
She flings it away. It slides into a counter and discharges into a fat man's leg. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS180
00:46:55,00 --> 00:47:00,50
SOMEONE scurries over to SOMEONE's side. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS181
00:47:38,00 --> 00:47:41,50
She nods. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS182
00:47:39,00 --> 00:47:43,50
She heads for the vault. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS183
00:47:51,00 --> 00:47:56,50
SOMEONE opens a barred gate and enters the vault. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS184
00:47:59,00 --> 00:48:03,50
She fills the sack with cash. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS185
00:48:08,00 --> 00:48:14,50
SOMEONE gives two sacks to SOMEONE, who tosses one to SOMEONE. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS186
00:48:28,00 --> 00:48:34,50
As the fat man reaches into the sack, blue paint explodes in his face. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS187
00:48:55,00 --> 00:49:00,50
SOMEONE hands him a garbage bag of cash. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS188
00:49:22,00 --> 00:49:26,50
They exit. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS189
00:49:26,00 --> 00:49:30,50
A police car cuts them off. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS190
00:49:41,00 --> 00:49:45,50
He reveals his vest. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS191
00:49:47,00 --> 00:49:52,50
The officer drops his gun and flees. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS192
00:49:54,00 --> 00:49:59,50
Now the getaway car pulls out, making a U-turn. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS193
00:49:56,00 --> 00:50:01,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch from the van. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS194
00:50:02,00 --> 00:50:08,50
Two police cars chase the Datsun down a main road. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS195
00:50:10,00 --> 00:50:18,50
He turns onto another street with the police cars hot on his tail. SOMEONE glances out the back window. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS196
00:50:24,00 --> 00:50:30,50
He briefly veers into the opposite lane toward oncoming traffic. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS197
00:50:32,00 --> 00:50:38,50
As the Datsun makes a sharp right, pedestrians dodge to a sidewalk. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS198
00:50:35,00 --> 00:50:41,50
One of the police cars crashes into a minivan. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS199
00:50:42,00 --> 00:50:46,50
SOMEONE shifts gears and races ahead. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS200
00:50:52,00 --> 00:50:57,50
Reaching an intersection, he pulls the emergency break. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS201
00:50:55,00 --> 00:51:01,50
As the car slides into a turn, he loses control and spins out completely. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS202
00:50:59,00 --> 00:51:03,50
A minivan drives by. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS203
00:51:07,00 --> 00:51:13,50
The Datsun peels out with the remaining police car on its tail. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS204
00:51:15,00 --> 00:51:20,50
SOMEONE speeds through a red light. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS205
00:51:17,00 --> 00:51:23,50
The police car follows but gets T-boned by a crossing dump truck. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS206
00:51:22,00 --> 00:51:30,50
Another police car T-bones the Datsun, which flips onto its roof and skids toward us. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS207
00:51:32,00 --> 00:51:38,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE unbuckle their seatbelts and land on their heads. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS208
00:51:38,00 --> 00:51:42,50
They climb out of the wreck. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS209
00:51:41,00 --> 00:51:48,50
Near the police car a stream of water rises four stories high. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS210
00:51:50,00 --> 00:51:54,50
They run through an alley. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS211
00:52:02,00 --> 00:52:07,50
SOMEONE pulls out the bloody shard. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS212
00:52:08,00 --> 00:52:13,50
They reach the end of the narrow alley. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS213
00:52:13,00 --> 00:52:17,50
They cross the street. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS214
00:52:16,00 --> 00:52:20,50
The bus halts. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS215
00:52:19,00 --> 00:52:24,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hurry onboard and take a seat. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS216
00:52:22,00 --> 00:52:28,50
As the bus pulls out two police officers exit the alley. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS217
00:52:25,00 --> 00:52:30,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE quickly hide their faces from the window. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS218
00:52:28,00 --> 00:52:32,50
Meanwhile, at the wrecked Datsun. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS219
00:52:38,00 --> 00:52:42,50
SOMEONE approaches a bystander. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS220
00:52:47,00 --> 00:52:53,50
Walking a residential street, SOMEONE looks at the cash in the bag. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS221
00:53:48,00 --> 00:53:52,50
They cross the street. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS222
00:53:51,00 --> 00:53:56,50
SOMEONE kisses his car. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS223
00:53:55,00 --> 00:53:59,50
He and SOMEONE get in. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS224
00:54:00,00 --> 00:54:04,50
SOMEONE takes out his cell phone. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS225
00:54:02,00 --> 00:54:08,50
Now the van parks in front of a Taco Boy restaurant. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS226
00:54:05,00 --> 00:54:09,50
SOMEONE steps out. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS227
00:54:11,00 --> 00:54:15,50
He answers his cellphone. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS228
00:54:36,00 --> 00:54:40,50
SOMEONE hangs up. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS229
00:54:38,00 --> 00:54:42,50
SOMEONE makes a call. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS230
00:54:44,00 --> 00:54:51,50
Now the Mustang speeds over railroad tracks back at Taco Boy. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS231
00:55:21,00 --> 00:55:26,50
He sets his cellphone on the table. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS232
00:55:24,00 --> 00:55:28,50
He slides it to SOMEONE. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS233
00:55:54,00 --> 00:56:00,50
Left alone, SOMEONE glances at the cell phone. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS234
00:55:58,00 --> 00:56:02,50
Now at the railroad bridge. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS235
00:56:11,00 --> 00:56:19,50
As SOMEONE's car arrives, SOMEONE grabs the garbage back from atop the Mustang's trunk. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS236
00:56:16,00 --> 00:56:25,50
The black car rolls up and parks between an abandoned building and the railroad tracks, about 20 feet away from SOMEONE's car. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS237
00:56:24,00 --> 00:56:28,50
SOMEONE climbs out. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS238
00:56:46,00 --> 00:56:50,50
He hands over the bag. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS239
00:57:24,00 --> 00:57:28,50
He reveals his vest. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS240
00:57:35,00 --> 00:57:39,50
He aims a pistol. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS241
00:57:58,00 --> 00:58:02,50
SOMEONE sneaks up. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS242
00:58:00,00 --> 00:58:06,50
He bashes SOMEONE with a crowbar. SOMEONE jumps on him. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS243
00:58:11,00 --> 00:58:17,50
SOMEONE pulls her down and slams her into SOMEONE's car, then grabs the bag. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS244
00:58:16,00 --> 00:58:20,50
SOMEONE gives her a weak stomp. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS245
00:58:22,00 --> 00:58:26,50
He and SOMEONE climb in the Mustang. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS246
00:58:26,00 --> 00:58:32,50
As they drive away she shoots at them with SOMEONE's gun. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS248
00:58:40,00 --> 00:58:46,50
In his garage SOMEONE trims SOMEONE's hair. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS249
00:58:51,00 --> 00:58:56,50
SOMEONE hands SOMEONE a mirror, then answers his cellphone. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS250
00:59:37,00 --> 00:59:41,50
SOMEONE hangs up. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS251
00:59:43,00 --> 00:59:49,50
The Mustang pulls over and SOMEONE runs a safe distance away. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS252
01:00:04,00 --> 01:00:10,50
In the garage, SOMEONE holds his cellphone to his ear. He looks at SOMEONE. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS253
01:00:11,00 --> 01:00:16,50
He hangs up and throws the phone. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS254
01:00:16,00 --> 01:00:21,50
He pulls off his barber cape and upends the table. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS255
01:00:48,00 --> 01:00:52,50
He grabs his phone. He dials. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS257
01:01:27,00 --> 01:01:33,50
As SOMEONE attacks, SOMEONE defends himself with the hair trimmer. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS258
01:01:31,00 --> 01:01:36,50
SOMEONE whips him with the cord. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS259
01:01:35,00 --> 01:01:40,50
SOMEONE punches him in the kidney. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS260
01:01:39,00 --> 01:01:44,50
SOMEONE plops on the couch. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS261
01:01:58,00 --> 01:02:03,50
SOMEONE inches over and retrieves the cellphone. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS262
01:02:03,00 --> 01:02:07,50
He sits across from SOMEONE. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS263
01:02:10,00 --> 01:02:14,50
SOMEONE sits up. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS264
01:02:22,00 --> 01:02:26,50
SOMEONE picks up the phone. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS265
01:03:02,00 --> 01:03:08,50
SOMEONE lowers the cellphone from his ear and looks at it. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS266
01:03:34,00 --> 01:03:40,50
SOMEONE shifts his gaze then nods understandingly. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS267
01:03:51,00 --> 01:03:57,50
SOMEONE tries to pull the bomb vest up over SOMEONE's head. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS268
01:04:01,00 --> 01:04:05,50
He steps aside and makes the call. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS269
01:04:17,00 --> 01:04:23,50
Now in a bathroom stall, SOMEONE unravels toilet paper. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS270
01:04:24,00 --> 01:04:30,50
Leaning forward she spots men's shoes crossing the checkered floor. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS271
01:04:28,00 --> 01:04:33,50
They reached the door of her stall. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS272
01:04:30,00 --> 01:04:35,50
SOMEONE nervously holds still. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS273
01:04:33,00 --> 01:04:39,50
The door swings open to reveal SOMEONE and SOMEONE in their ape masks. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS274
01:04:45,00 --> 01:04:51,50
Now a reality show plays on a flat screen TV. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS275
01:04:48,00 --> 01:04:53,50
The Major watches from his bed. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS276
01:04:53,00 --> 01:04:58,50
He knits his brow at the sound. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS277
01:05:01,00 --> 01:05:05,50
He slips out of bed. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS278
01:05:04,00 --> 01:05:10,50
From a desk he grabs a pen with a plunger at its end. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS279
01:05:09,00 --> 01:05:17,50
He opens the door with the pen poised in his right hand, then cautiously steps out of the bedroom. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS280
01:05:17,00 --> 01:05:23,50
Advancing through a hallway he creeps past a windowed door. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS281
01:05:21,00 --> 01:05:27,50
He heads towards a giant framed Michigan Lottery check adorning the wall. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS282
01:05:26,00 --> 01:05:31,50
Stepping around the corner he scans the area. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS283
01:05:29,00 --> 01:05:33,50
He heads down a set of steps. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS285
01:05:33,00 --> 01:05:37,50
SOMEONE aims his pistol at the Major's back. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS286
01:05:37,00 --> 01:05:43,50
The Major smirks, then faces him and lowers his pen. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS287
01:06:11,00 --> 01:06:15,50
The Major smiles defiantly. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS288
01:06:26,00 --> 01:06:31,50
He shoots SOMEONE in the neck with his pen. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS289
01:06:28,00 --> 01:06:34,50
He straddles the intruder who fends off his pen gun. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS290
01:06:35,00 --> 01:06:41,50
The hit man grabs his own gun and pistol-whips him. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS291
01:06:38,00 --> 01:06:44,50
Jumping up SOMEONE stands over the Major. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS292
01:06:46,00 --> 01:06:51,50
SOMEONE shoots him in the stomach. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS293
01:06:58,00 --> 01:07:04,50
He heads upstairs, leaving the wounded Major on the floor. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS294
01:07:01,00 --> 01:07:09,50
In a bathroom, facing a mirror, SOMEONE finds a bottle of rubbing alcohol and twists it open. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS295
01:07:14,00 --> 01:07:21,50
He pours the rubbing alcohol on his neck wound, then grimaces and shakes his head. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS296
01:07:20,00 --> 01:07:27,50
Fighting tears he holds a towel to his neck and hurries out. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS297
01:07:24,00 --> 01:07:30,50
SOMEONE barges into SOMEONE's bedroom and drops the bloody towel. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS298
01:07:27,00 --> 01:07:34,50
He searches a workbench, then crosses the room and ransacks a bookshelf. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS299
01:07:33,00 --> 01:07:39,50
Noticing a desk with a padlock on one of its drawers he takes aim. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS301
01:07:39,00 --> 01:07:43,50
He opens the drawer. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS302
01:07:40,00 --> 01:07:51,50
Searching the contents of a folder he finds a hand-drawn schematic showing the scrapyard, the bank and SOMEONE's Tantastic Tan Salon. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS304
01:08:49,00 --> 01:08:54,50
He hands SOMEONE the phone. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS305
01:09:11,00 --> 01:09:15,50
SOMEONE hangs up. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS306
01:10:07,00 --> 01:10:14,50
SOMEONE sits in the passenger seat while SOMEONE grabs the loot and gets behind the wheel. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS307
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:30,50
The Mustang pulls out of the empty lot and drives off past a few warehouses. Now our view rises from one the van's headlights to SOMEONE, who drives with a determined look in his eyes, wearing his chimpanzee mask. SOMEONE repeatedly pokes at SOMEONE's face, which is covered in a Slayer T-shirt. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS308
01:10:28,00 --> 01:10:34,50
The van speeds down an industrial road at dusk. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS309
01:10:31,00 --> 01:10:37,50
Later that night our view rises from one of the Mustang's headlights to SOMEONE, 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS310
01:10:35,00 --> 01:10:40,50
who glances determinedly at his best friend beside him. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS311
01:10:39,00 --> 01:10:44,50
SOMEONE glances back. The Mustang parks. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS312
01:10:45,00 --> 01:10:51,50
SOMEONE steps out and the Mustang continues on down the dirt road. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS313
01:10:49,00 --> 01:10:55,50
SOMEONE runs down a path strewn with garbage. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS314
01:10:53,00 --> 01:11:00,50
Now our view rises from a heap of crushed cars to reveal the Mustang arriving in the scrapyard. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS315
01:10:59,00 --> 01:11:04,50
Its headlights go dim and SOMEONE steps out. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS316
01:11:06,00 --> 01:11:11,50
SOMEONE exits the van in his mask. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS317
01:11:11,00 --> 01:11:15,50
SOMEONE drops the bag. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS318
01:11:18,00 --> 01:11:23,50
SOMEONE ditches his jacket then picks the bag back up. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS319
01:11:39,00 --> 01:11:45,50
SOMEONE enters the code into a keypad on the wired vest. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS320
01:11:42,00 --> 01:11:48,50
A buckle adorned with a smiley face sticker releases four straps. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS321
01:11:48,00 --> 01:11:54,50
SOMEONE slowly unzips the vest from top to bottom then slides it off. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS322
01:12:00,00 --> 01:12:06,50
As SOMEONE sets the vest aside SOMEONE claps his hands overhead. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS323
01:12:40,00 --> 01:12:48,50
They make the switch. SOMEONE removes the shirt from SOMEONE's face and she hugs him. SOMEONE eyes the cash. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS324
01:13:03,00 --> 01:13:07,50
He aims his gun. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS325
01:13:15,00 --> 01:13:22,50
A red dot shines on the forehead of SOMEONE's mask emanating from SOMEONE's laser path. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS326
01:13:23,00 --> 01:13:27,50
SOMEONE pulls off his mask. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS327
01:13:30,00 --> 01:13:35,50
He yanks off his mask. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS328
01:14:03,00 --> 01:14:10,50
SOMEONE pistol-whips SOMEONE, knocking him to the dirt. SOMEONE tries to rouse her friend. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS329
01:14:23,00 --> 01:14:28,50
He tosses the bag over. SOMEONE cocks his pistol. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS330
01:14:52,00 --> 01:14:56,50
SOMEONE shoots a plume of fire. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS331
01:14:56,00 --> 01:15:01,50
A charred SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE in the shoulder. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS332
01:15:00,00 --> 01:15:08,50
SOMEONE screams as he watches his partner collapse onto his back. SOMEONE rouses SOMEONE. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS333
01:15:06,00 --> 01:15:11,50
He spots the moneybag. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS334
01:15:09,00 --> 01:15:14,50
SOMEONE torches SOMEONE again. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS335
01:15:13,00 --> 01:15:18,50
He shoots a bullet into the flamethrower tank. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS336
01:15:15,00 --> 01:15:21,50
It explodes sending SOMEONE flying off his feet. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS337
01:15:27,00 --> 01:15:31,50
SOMEONE runs back with the bag. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS338
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:35,50
SOMEONE sits up and sees them getting into the Mustang. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS339
01:15:35,00 --> 01:15:39,50
They shut the car doors. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS340
01:15:38,00 --> 01:15:42,50
He glances at his van. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS341
01:15:43,00 --> 01:15:49,50
SOMEONE lies face down his back consumed in flames. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS342
01:15:51,00 --> 01:15:58,50
As the Mustang drives off, SOMEONE takes off his jacket and whips it at the flaming tank. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS343
01:15:55,00 --> 01:16:01,50
Embers rise into the air as he puts out the fire. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS344
01:15:59,00 --> 01:16:04,50
He kneels at his friend's side and rolls him over. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS345
01:16:37,00 --> 01:16:42,50
He watches SOMEONE hobble off with his gun. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS347
01:16:53,00 --> 01:16:59,50
In the mustang, SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE and kisses him as he drives. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS348
01:16:59,00 --> 01:17:03,50
The van approaches. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS349
01:17:08,00 --> 01:17:15,50
He pulls up alongside the Mustang, SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE through their open windows. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS350
01:17:18,00 --> 01:17:22,50
He takes aim. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS351
01:17:20,00 --> 01:17:26,50
The unit freezes and a digital timer flashes zero. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS352
01:17:23,00 --> 01:17:29,50
A fiery explosion flips the van upside down. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS353
01:17:26,00 --> 01:17:33,50
The Mustang gets away as the flaming wreck tumbles to a stop on its side. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS354
01:17:56,00 --> 01:18:01,50
A stack of cash sprays blue paint in SOMEONE's face. 

30_MINUTES_OR_LESS_DVS355
01:17:59,00 --> 01:18:05,50
As the Mustang drives away, the picture cuts to black.
