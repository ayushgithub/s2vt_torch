500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS31
00:02:44,00 --> 00:02:48,50
The boy peddles with his mother. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS32
00:02:45,00 --> 00:02:50,50
The girl's on a slide. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS35
00:02:55,00 --> 00:03:01,50
The boy eats cake messily. The girl grins, holding a candle. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS38
00:03:02,00 --> 00:03:07,50
The children smile at the cameras. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS40
00:03:06,00 --> 00:03:12,50
The girl feeds some ducks. The boy rides on a miniature railway. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS43
00:03:17,00 --> 00:03:22,50
The boy, now older, plays an electric guitar. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS45
00:03:21,00 --> 00:03:25,50
The girl does a cartwheel. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS46
00:03:22,00 --> 00:03:26,50
She waves to the camera 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS47
00:03:24,00 --> 00:03:28,50
She makes an origami paper model. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS49
00:03:36,00 --> 00:03:40,50
The boy plays football. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS50
00:03:37,00 --> 00:03:41,50
The girl rides a horse. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS53
00:03:45,00 --> 00:03:49,50
The girl blows on a dandelion. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS54
00:03:47,00 --> 00:03:51,50
The boy plays with bubbles. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS56
00:03:58,00 --> 00:04:03,50
One scrolls forwards to 290. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS57
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:05,50
A young girl cycles through the city at night. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS58
00:04:05,00 --> 00:04:10,50
The road passes rapidly beneath the bike's wheels. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS59
00:04:08,00 --> 00:04:15,50
She chains the bike to a post, and wearing a helmet, strides towards the entrance to an apartment building. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS60
00:04:15,00 --> 00:04:19,50
She hurries in. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS61
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:21,50
Two guys open an apartment door. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS62
00:04:31,00 --> 00:04:37,50
SOMEONE's in the kitchen, smashing plates on a counter. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS63
00:05:07,00 --> 00:05:12,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk hand in hand. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS64
00:05:09,00 --> 00:05:13,50
They kiss in bed. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS65
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:15,50
They walk through an Ikea store holding hands. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS66
00:05:15,00 --> 00:05:21,50
They hug in the street and grin at a Ringo Starr record in a shop. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS67
00:06:09,00 --> 00:06:14,50
A waitress brings two plates. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS68
00:06:27,00 --> 00:06:31,50
SOMEONE gets up. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS69
00:07:03,00 --> 00:07:07,50
Back to day one. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS70
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:23,50
A poster of a child with mothers. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS71
00:09:16,00 --> 00:09:21,50
SOMEONE blinks alluringly. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS72
00:09:18,00 --> 00:09:24,50
Day three, and she's at work in a vest top. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS73
00:09:50,00 --> 00:09:56,50
SOMEONE goes back to work. Three rolls over to four. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS74
00:09:53,00 --> 00:09:58,50
Wearing headphones, SOMEONE enters a lift. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS75
00:09:55,00 --> 00:10:00,50
SOMEONE hurries in as well. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS76
00:10:06,00 --> 00:10:14,50
SOMEONE, in shirt and cardigan with a loosely knotted tie, studiously ignores the dark haired large-eyed SOMEONE. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS77
00:10:38,00 --> 00:10:43,50
SOMEONE stares at her, entranced. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS78
00:10:44,00 --> 00:10:49,50
SOMEONE exits, leaving SOMEONE awestruck. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS79
00:10:46,00 --> 00:10:51,50
Four advances to eight. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS80
00:10:48,00 --> 00:10:53,50
A sign reads, Happy engagement, SOMEONE. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS81
00:10:59,00 --> 00:11:05,50
SOMEONE's handing out glasses of bubbly. He spots SOMEONE standing alone. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS82
00:12:09,00 --> 00:12:13,50
He hands her a greetings card. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS83
00:12:35,00 --> 00:12:39,50
SOMEONE chokes on his bubbles. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS84
00:12:42,00 --> 00:12:47,50
He nods and wipes wine off his face. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS85
00:12:49,00 --> 00:12:55,50
He stares after her as she walks away through the open plan office. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS86
00:12:57,00 --> 00:13:02,50
He studies her as she sits at her desk 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS87
00:12:59,00 --> 00:13:04,50
He sits down at his work station. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS88
00:13:06,00 --> 00:13:13,50
As he starts a drawing, SOMEONE glances across the office towards him. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS89
00:13:11,00 --> 00:13:16,50
He's drawing a city skyline in pencil. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS90
00:13:17,00 --> 00:13:22,50
There's another drawing of a building in a frame on his desk. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS91
00:13:19,00 --> 00:13:23,50
With a look of dissatisfaction, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS92
00:13:21,00 --> 00:13:26,50
he rubs out what he's done so far on the new picture. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS93
00:13:28,00 --> 00:13:36,50
He glances around the office then screws up his piece of paper into a ball. 8 jumps to 154. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS94
00:14:14,00 --> 00:14:19,50
SOMEONE's long-haired friend looks worried. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS95
00:14:19,00 --> 00:14:24,50
154 skips back to 11. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS96
00:14:44,00 --> 00:14:50,50
SOMEONE beats him at tennis on the Wii. 11 jumps to 22. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS97
00:15:52,00 --> 00:15:56,50
She blinks in puzzled inquiry. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS98
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:07,50
His friend and colleague grins as SOMEONE watches SOMEONE walk across the room. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS99
00:16:04,00 --> 00:16:09,50
SOMEONE finds the Smiths on his iTunes. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS100
00:16:18,00 --> 00:16:25,50
SOMEONE turns the music up as SOMEONE walks across the office to leave work, her handbag over her shoulder. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS101
00:16:23,00 --> 00:16:27,50
He stares at her. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS102
00:16:25,00 --> 00:16:29,50
But she doesn't even glance in his direction. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS103
00:16:54,00 --> 00:17:02,50
22 jumps to 27. In the office, SOMEONE's friend mimes for him to take off his headset. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS104
00:17:28,00 --> 00:17:33,50
SOMEONE's eyes flick towards SOMEONE. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS105
00:17:32,00 --> 00:17:37,50
Day 27 becomes day 28. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS106
00:18:01,00 --> 00:18:05,50
SOMEONE heads for the pub stage. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS107
00:18:06,00 --> 00:18:11,50
SOMEONE's friend, Mackenzie, hands him a beer. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS108
00:18:40,00 --> 00:18:49,50
SOMEONE smiles as she sings, then grabs another couple of beers and chasers from the bar. SOMEONE's sitting in a booth with Mackenzie. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS109
00:20:41,00 --> 00:20:45,50
They study one another. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS110
00:22:22,00 --> 00:22:27,50
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE try to think, Mackenzie hits the stage. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS111
00:22:33,00 --> 00:22:38,50
He drops the mic and drunkenly downs another shot. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS112
00:23:12,00 --> 00:23:16,50
Smiling, she looks him in the eye. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS113
00:24:01,00 --> 00:24:04,50
He stares at her. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS114
00:24:02,00 --> 00:24:06,50
She smiles back. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS115
00:24:17,00 --> 00:24:22,50
She gives a casual salute and heads off. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS116
00:24:20,00 --> 00:24:25,50
He remains, staring after her. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS117
00:24:24,00 --> 00:24:29,50
Standing on the pavement outside the bar. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS118
00:24:26,00 --> 00:24:31,50
SOMEONE turns slowly and walks away. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS119
00:24:30,00 --> 00:24:34,50
Day 28 becomes day 31 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS120
00:24:32,00 --> 00:24:37,50
SOMEONE's at the photocopier when SOMEONE walks up. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS121
00:24:39,00 --> 00:24:43,50
She gets on with some copying of her own 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS122
00:24:41,00 --> 00:24:45,50
They work side by side. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS123
00:24:49,00 --> 00:24:55,50
Unsure what to say, SOMEONE half turns toward SOMEONE 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS124
00:24:52,00 --> 00:24:57,50
who's just getting on with her copying. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS125
00:25:02,00 --> 00:25:06,50
She moves away from the copier 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS126
00:25:03,00 --> 00:25:07,50
and approaches SOMEONE. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS127
00:25:09,00 --> 00:25:13,50
They kiss. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS128
00:25:15,00 --> 00:25:19,50
They hold each other close, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS129
00:25:17,00 --> 00:25:21,50
kissing with increasing passion. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS130
00:25:31,00 --> 00:25:36,50
SOMEONE turns and walks back to her copying. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS131
00:25:33,00 --> 00:25:37,50
She picks up her file. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS132
00:25:34,00 --> 00:25:39,50
She briefly looks SOMEONE in the eye. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS133
00:25:36,00 --> 00:25:40,50
Then She walks away. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS134
00:25:38,00 --> 00:25:42,50
SOMEONE's thoroughly confused. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS135
00:25:43,00 --> 00:25:49,50
Later, SOMEONE opens his front door to his long-haired friend, SOMEONE. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS136
00:26:14,00 --> 00:26:19,50
SOMEONE gasps, realizing SOMEONE's in the apartment. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS137
00:26:27,00 --> 00:26:33,50
SOMEONE nods awkwardly and has no idea what to say. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS138
00:26:41,00 --> 00:26:47,50
SOMEONE dismisses him with a salute, then turns to SOMEONE. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS139
00:26:57,00 --> 00:27:02,50
SOMEONE drops his head in embarrassment. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS140
00:27:00,00 --> 00:27:05,50
Day 282 and a tap isn't working. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS141
00:27:07,00 --> 00:27:12,50
It's a sink in a showroom. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS142
00:27:09,00 --> 00:27:13,50
SOMEONE's standing nearby. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS143
00:27:16,00 --> 00:27:22,50
She walks off, unimpressed by his attempt at humor. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS144
00:27:19,00 --> 00:27:24,50
282 rewinds to 34. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS145
00:27:31,00 --> 00:27:34,50
They're in Ikea. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS146
00:27:44,00 --> 00:27:50,50
She grabs a dummy remote from a coffee table and pretends to watch TV. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS147
00:28:01,00 --> 00:28:09,50
SOMEONE jumps up from the sofa they've been sitting on and walks off. SOMEONE follows. They arrive at a kitchen display. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS148
00:28:20,00 --> 00:28:24,50
He clowns, sitting at a table 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS149
00:28:22,00 --> 00:28:26,50
as SOMEONE wanders over to the sink. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS150
00:28:31,00 --> 00:28:35,50
He walks through to another display. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS151
00:28:40,00 --> 00:28:44,50
She ballets out of the kitchen. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS152
00:28:42,00 --> 00:28:48,50
SOMEONE chases her through the huge furniture store. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS153
00:28:50,00 --> 00:28:55,50
SOMEONE dives onto a double bed. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS154
00:28:52,00 --> 00:28:57,50
SOMEONE crawls on after her 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS155
00:28:54,00 --> 00:28:59,50
and looks deep into her eyes. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS156
00:29:10,00 --> 00:29:15,50
They look around, slowly. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS157
00:29:12,00 --> 00:29:19,50
A whole Chinese family is indeed staring at them from the on-suite bathroom display. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS158
00:29:17,00 --> 00:29:21,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE smile 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS159
00:29:18,00 --> 00:29:23,50
and the family wanders off glumly. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS160
00:29:25,00 --> 00:29:29,50
They face each other on the bed. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS161
00:30:22,00 --> 00:30:26,50
She gets up 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS162
00:30:23,00 --> 00:30:27,50
and he stays thoughtfully on the bed. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS165
00:30:28,00 --> 00:30:32,50
As they wander through Ikea, SOMEONE takes SOMEONE's hand. There are signs on the store wall,"Ikea Stockholm. We don't make fancy quality, we make true every day quality". 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS171
00:30:42,00 --> 00:30:47,50
At night, they tumble, kissing on to the bed. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS173
00:30:53,00 --> 00:30:58,50
SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE heads to the bathroom. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS174
00:31:19,00 --> 00:31:26,50
SOMEONE comes out of the bathroom and stares. SOMEONE's now naked in his bed. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS175
00:31:29,00 --> 00:31:33,50
SOMEONE switches off the bathroom light and approaches the bed. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS177
00:31:34,00 --> 00:31:41,50
In daylight, he walks out of the apartment building with a broad grin on his face. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS178
00:31:42,00 --> 00:31:49,50
SOMEONE struts jauntily down the street and everyone who passes smiles at him. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS179
00:31:46,00 --> 00:31:51,50
He pauses to check his look in a shop window. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS180
00:31:48,00 --> 00:31:55,50
The reflection he sees is Harrison Ford as SOMEONE Solo winking back at him. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS181
00:31:55,00 --> 00:32:01,50
A large fountain erupts like watery fireworks. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS182
00:31:58,00 --> 00:32:04,50
SOMEONE boogies his way past the display and through a park. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS184
00:32:03,00 --> 00:32:08,50
He cheerfully greets the people he meets, even kissing one woman's hand. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS185
00:32:12,00 --> 00:32:19,50
He daps and slaps with a couple of guys he meets on his sunny walk to work, shakes a lot of hands, and is wreathed in smiles. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS188
00:32:19,00 --> 00:32:24,50
He tosses his bag to a woman and starts to dance. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS189
00:32:21,00 --> 00:32:27,50
Everyone on the path dances with him and it turns into a routine. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS190
00:32:32,00 --> 00:32:38,50
SOMEONE grabs a baseball bat and knocks an imaginary ball out of the park. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS191
00:32:36,00 --> 00:32:41,50
He's hoisted shoulder high by his dancing friends. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS192
00:32:48,00 --> 00:32:56,50
The large crowd of dancers is joined by a marching band in full colorful military style uniform. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS193
00:32:57,00 --> 00:33:03,50
A little cartoon bluebird flits up to SOMEONE and lands on his shoulder. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS194
00:33:00,00 --> 00:33:04,50
It hops onto his finger. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS195
00:33:02,00 --> 00:33:07,50
He strokes its head and lets it go. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS196
00:33:04,00 --> 00:33:09,50
It winks down at him as it flies off. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS197
00:33:07,00 --> 00:33:11,50
SOMEONE puts his bag back on. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS198
00:33:08,00 --> 00:33:13,50
SOMEONE with a satisfied grin. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS199
00:33:10,00 --> 00:33:14,50
He dashes off to work. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS200
00:33:18,00 --> 00:33:23,50
He skips happily through the front door and to the lift 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS201
00:33:20,00 --> 00:33:24,50
He smirking to himself. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS202
00:33:27,00 --> 00:33:41,50
Day 35 rolls forward to day 303, and the lift door opens revealing a despondent, disheveled SOMEONE. He sits hollow-eyed, staring towards the desk where SOMEONE used to sit. His boss has a new assistant with a large afro. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS203
00:33:48,00 --> 00:33:53,50
SOMEONE stares gloomily at Mackenzie. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS205
00:34:26,00 --> 00:34:34,50
Day 303 rolls back to day 45. Mackenzie sees SOMEONE singing on the phone. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS206
00:35:03,00 --> 00:35:11,50
It's day 87 and they're in a DVD and music store. SOMEONE leads Toms through to the adult's only section. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS207
00:35:11,00 --> 00:35:17,50
At home, they're on a sofa watching a DVD called Sweet and Shower. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS208
00:35:27,00 --> 00:35:31,50
They're fooling around in the shower.

00:35:40,00 --> 00:35:50,50
SOMEONE points up at the city's sculpted stone buildings and at the multi-level Eastern Columbia building with a large clock face and the word Eastern in bold white letters. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS211
00:36:07,00 --> 00:36:14,50
They sit on the park bench overlooking some of the downtown buildings. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS212
00:37:26,00 --> 00:37:30,50
She hands him a pen. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS213
00:37:47,00 --> 00:37:51,50
He rolls up her sleeve. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS214
00:37:57,00 --> 00:38:02,50
He draws on the inside of her wrist. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS215
00:38:05,00 --> 00:38:11,50
He creates a detailed skyline on the inside of her forearm. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS216
00:38:15,00 --> 00:38:19,50

It's evening. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS218
00:38:17,00 --> 00:38:22,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE arrive at SOMEONE's place. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS219
00:38:24,00 --> 00:38:30,50
SOMEONE closes the front door and walks slowly into the apartment with patterned wallpaper, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS220
00:38:27,00 --> 00:38:31,50
boxes still unpacked, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS221
00:38:29,00 --> 00:38:34,50
pictures and books resting on the mantelpiece and on the floor. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS222
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:30,50
Lying on the bed, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS223
00:40:27,00 --> 00:40:31,50
SOMEONE studies her. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS224
00:41:18,00 --> 00:41:24,50

SOMEONE's little sister runs of to join her football team on the pitch. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS228
00:42:29,00 --> 00:42:34,50
SOMEONE remains sitting thoughtfully on the bleachers. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS229
00:42:35,00 --> 00:42:41,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE drive through the city in SOMEONE's aging 3 Series BMW. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS230
00:43:17,00 --> 00:43:22,50
She nuzzles his arm and he grins. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS232
00:43:21,00 --> 00:43:25,50
They smile happily and she studies him as they drive. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS233
00:43:32,00 --> 00:43:37,50
They have fun chatting as they drive through the sunny city. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS234
00:43:41,00 --> 00:43:45,50
They drive into a tunnel. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS235

Day 259. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS236
00:44:05,00 --> 00:44:09,50
They're in a cocktail bar. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS237
00:44:14,00 --> 00:44:19,50
A suit makes a beeline for SOMEONE. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS238
00:44:56,00 --> 00:45:01,50
She calmly sips her cocktail. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS239
00:45:02,00 --> 00:45:08,50
The big guy challenges SOMEONE who eyes him with calm distaste and sips his drink. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS241
00:45:09,00 --> 00:45:13,50
The guy wanders off. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS242
00:45:18,00 --> 00:45:23,50
SOMEONE floors him with a right hook. The guy responds. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS244
00:45:39,00 --> 00:45:43,50
SOMEONE's not happy. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS246
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:16,50
With an ice pack to his cheek, SOMEONE doesn't know what to say. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS247
00:46:19,00 --> 00:46:23,50
He turns away from her and heads for the front door. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS249
00:46:57,00 --> 00:47:01,50
She sits on the bed and he shrugs, challenging her. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS251
00:47:12,00 --> 00:47:19,50
SOMEONE stunned. As SOMEONE stomps downstairs, he meets two women coming up. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS252
00:47:22,00 --> 00:47:27,50
He continues down the many flights of wooden stairs. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS254
00:47:36,00 --> 00:47:40,50
he lies restlessly in bed. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS255
00:47:42,00 --> 00:47:47,50
SOMEONE lies still in her bed. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS256
00:48:00,00 --> 00:48:04,50
SOMEONE sits up in bed. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS257
00:48:02,00 --> 00:48:07,50
It's still night time and raining outside. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS259
00:48:05,00 --> 00:48:09,50
He gets up and puts on a t-shirt. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS260
00:48:15,00 --> 00:48:20,50
He wanders slowly to open the front door. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS262
00:48:25,00 --> 00:48:30,50
She stares at him expressionlessly, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS263
00:48:27,00 --> 00:48:32,50
then rests her head wearily against the door frame. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS264
00:49:08,00 --> 00:49:12,50
She moves close to him. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS265
00:49:19,00 --> 00:49:24,50
She touches his bruised jaw 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS266
00:49:21,00 --> 00:49:25,50
She kisses him gently. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS267
00:49:37,00 --> 00:49:42,50
She links her arms around SOMEONE's neck and they kiss. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS269
00:50:04,00 --> 00:50:09,50
They're lying in bed in their pajamas. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS270
00:50:53,00 --> 00:50:58,50
SOMEONE has a large bulge in the crotch of his leather trousers. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS271
00:51:07,00 --> 00:51:12,50
She slumps back down on the bed. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS273
00:51:30,00 --> 00:51:35,50
SOMEONE gently nudges his shoulder with her head. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS274
00:52:13,00 --> 00:52:18,50
They're sitting on a blanket in the park. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS275
00:52:24,00 --> 00:52:36,50
Day 266 flips back to day 191. SOMEONE and SOMEONE are at an art gallery. There's a picture of two dogs copulating. They're standing in front of huge prints of intertwined tubes. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS276
00:52:48,00 --> 00:52:54,50
They stare in bafflement at a coiled poo. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS277
00:52:56,00 --> 00:53:01,50
The sign outside the cinema proclaims, part vampire, part giant. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS280
00:53:02,00 --> 00:53:07,50
They smile and eat popcorn in the theater 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS281
00:53:04,00 --> 00:53:09,50
as others laugh and cringe in equal measure. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS282
00:53:08,00 --> 00:53:14,50
Day 191 fast forwards to day 314 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS283
00:53:12,00 --> 00:53:17,50
and SOMEONE's sitting alone in the cinema. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS284
00:53:19,00 --> 00:53:24,50
The film is black and white and the star is SOMEONE. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS285
00:53:22,00 --> 00:53:26,50
Subtitles read, "He is broken, more than broken, he is alone". 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS289
00:53:32,00 --> 00:53:36,50
The SOMEONE character's carrying a balloon. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS290
00:53:34,00 --> 00:53:39,50
He turns around to face a mime in a top hat 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS291
00:53:37,00 --> 00:53:41,50
and hands him the balloon. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS292
00:53:43,00 --> 00:53:47,50
The mime smiles happily 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS293
00:53:45,00 --> 00:53:49,50
and lets the balloon go. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS294
00:53:46,00 --> 00:53:50,50
It floats up into the air. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS295
00:53:53,00 --> 00:53:58,50
The mime eyeballs SOMEONE and then slaps him. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS301
00:54:08,00 --> 00:54:15,50
A crusader SOMEONE plays chess with a little winged angel by a rocky shore. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS303
00:54:17,00 --> 00:54:21,50
The child angel moves. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS306
00:54:25,00 --> 00:54:32,50
Crusader SOMEONE buries his face in his hands. The word "fin" appears on the black screen. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS307
00:54:30,00 --> 00:54:35,50
SOMEONE wakes up in the cinema. Looks around, then gets up. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS308
00:54:36,00 --> 00:54:41,50
Day 314 jumps to day 321. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS310
00:54:41,00 --> 00:54:46,50
The new assistant approaches SOMEONE's workstation. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS311
00:55:23,00 --> 00:55:28,50
SOMEONE's head sags. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS312
00:56:11,00 --> 00:56:16,50
Vance shows SOMEONE a selection of greetings cards. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS313
00:56:28,00 --> 00:56:33,50
He dismisses SOMEONE with a friendly smile. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS314
00:56:35,00 --> 00:56:41,50
SOMEONE picks up the cards and trudges slowly out of the office. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS315
00:56:39,00 --> 00:56:43,50
On the assistant's desk he spots a card with "I love us". 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS317
00:56:45,00 --> 00:56:48,50
He scowls. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS318
00:56:46,00 --> 00:56:54,50
Day 321 rolls back to day 167. SOMEONE strides into the office. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS319
00:57:30,00 --> 00:57:34,50
SOMEONE spots SOMEONE across the office. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS320
00:57:32,00 --> 00:57:36,50
She smiles at him. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS321
00:57:37,00 --> 00:57:42,50
Fast forward to day 322. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS322
00:58:01,00 --> 00:58:06,50
SOMEONE yells on a bus which lurches to a halt. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS324
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:24,50
SOMEONE remembers the cinema, Ikea, and the record store. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS325
00:59:57,00 --> 01:00:03,50
SOMEONE stares at auburn haired SOMEONE, then grins tipsily. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS326
01:00:09,00 --> 01:00:16,50

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS327
01:00:17,00 --> 01:00:21,50
SOMEONE leaves.

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS331
01:01:06,00 --> 01:01:11,50
SOMEONE continues glumly down the train. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS332
01:01:15,00 --> 01:01:20,50
He scans left and right looking for a space 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS333
01:01:17,00 --> 01:01:22,50
and walks right past SOMEONE. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS334
01:01:20,00 --> 01:01:25,50
He chucks his suit carrier into the luggage rack 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS335
01:01:22,00 --> 01:01:28,50
and flops down into a seat further down the carriage. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS336
01:01:30,00 --> 01:01:34,50

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS344
01:02:57,00 --> 01:03:01,50

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS370
01:07:25,00 --> 01:07:29,50
SOMEONE's next in the frame. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS371
01:07:30,00 --> 01:07:34,50
The camera switched off. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS372
01:07:34,00 --> 01:07:40,50
SOMEONE and Susan Trainers rings the bell to a building with a wrought iron entrance. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS373
01:07:43,00 --> 01:07:48,50
Clutching a present, SOMEONE goes inside. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS374
01:07:58,00 --> 01:08:05,50
Expectations appears as a subtitle on a split screen as SOMEONE climbs the stairs. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS375
01:08:02,00 --> 01:08:08,50
On the other side of the screen, reality is the caption as he walks down a corridor. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS376
01:08:10,00 --> 01:08:17,50
In expectations, SOMEONE opens the door, smiles, and kisses SOMEONE on the lips. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS377
01:08:24,00 --> 01:08:30,50
In reality, she opens the door, gives him a friendly hug, and ushers him in. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS378
01:08:28,00 --> 01:08:33,50
SOMEONE nods to the gathered guests and gives SOMEONE the gift. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS379
01:08:38,00 --> 01:08:44,50
He acknowledgment was in expectations. In reality, she opens the gift in silence. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS380
01:08:50,00 --> 01:08:57,50
In expectations, she hugs him in thanks for the architecture of happiness, not in reality. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS381
01:09:16,00 --> 01:09:24,50
In reality, they're on opposite sides of a chatting group. In expectations, they're talking together, ignoring everyone else. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS382
01:09:21,00 --> 01:09:27,50
Later in reality, SOMEONE sips a beer alone. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS383
01:09:26,00 --> 01:09:31,50
In expectations, they're together, flirting. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS385
01:09:32,00 --> 01:09:38,50
SOMEONE watches glumly as SOMEONE chats to two guys. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS387
01:09:37,00 --> 01:09:43,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk indoors together and kiss passionately. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS389
01:09:42,00 --> 01:09:46,50
SOMEONE fixes himself another drink. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS392
01:09:50,00 --> 01:09:56,50
SOMEONE stares as SOMEONE shows a girlfriend a ring on her left hand. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS393
01:09:59,00 --> 01:10:06,50
His jaw sags and his eyes fill with tears as he notices it's a diamond engagement ring. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS394
01:10:04,00 --> 01:10:08,50
He puts down his drink and leaves, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS395
01:10:06,00 --> 01:10:10,50
He is running down the stairs. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS396
01:10:16,00 --> 01:10:25,50
He storms out into the night, striding down the road, fighting back tears as he encounters a couple walking arm in arm. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS397
01:10:28,00 --> 01:10:32,50
He walks down the middle of the road. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS398
01:10:31,00 --> 01:10:36,50
The city becomes a grey, black and white drawing 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS399
01:10:34,00 --> 01:10:38,50
which is then erased, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS400
01:10:36,00 --> 01:10:41,50
just leaving SOMEONE as a black silhouette 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS401
01:10:39,00 --> 01:10:43,50
standing with his shadow 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS402
01:10:40,00 --> 01:10:45,50
in the middle of nothing. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS403
01:10:46,00 --> 01:10:51,50
The SOMEONE silhouette fades. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS404
01:10:50,00 --> 01:10:56,50
Day 408 jumps forward to day 440. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS405
01:10:54,00 --> 01:10:59,50
It's 7:00 AM. SOMEONE slaps off his alarm. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS406
01:10:58,00 --> 01:11:03,50
Day 441, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS407
01:11:01,00 --> 01:11:07,50
it's 7:00 AM. SOMEONE slaps off his alarm. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS408
01:11:06,00 --> 01:11:12,50
SOMEONE stares at the alarm clock with an empty Twinkie packet beside it 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS409
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:14,50
then rolls himself up in his bed clothes. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS410
01:11:11,00 --> 01:11:16,50
Day 441 and a half, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS411
01:11:13,00 --> 01:11:19,50
SOMEONE buys Blackjack Bourbon, juice, and Twinkies. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS412
01:11:16,00 --> 01:11:20,50
He's in his dressing gown. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS413
01:11:18,00 --> 01:11:24,50
He gives a "so what" shrug to the concerned shopkeeper. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS414
01:11:24,00 --> 01:11:30,50
He wanders out of the shop past another happy couple holding hands. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS415
01:11:33,00 --> 01:11:37,50
SOMEONE shuffles off. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS416
01:11:36,00 --> 01:11:40,50
Day 442. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS417
01:11:38,00 --> 01:11:44,50
There's a pile of empty cake packets and an aspirin bottle next to the alarm clock. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS418
01:11:42,00 --> 01:11:46,50
SOMEONE lies, staring at the ceiling. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS420
01:11:47,00 --> 01:11:55,50
SOMEONE trudges into the office wearing shades. Mackenzie's on the phone, looks up and notices his friend. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS421
01:14:05,00 --> 01:14:10,50
SOMEONE throws the card on the boardroom table. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS422
01:14:53,00 --> 01:14:59,50
His colleagues watch in stunned silence as SOMEONE walks out. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS423
01:15:00,00 --> 01:15:07,50
Mackenzie stops, realizing he's alone in appreciating SOMEONE's performance. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS424
01:15:04,00 --> 01:15:10,50
SOMEONE exits the lift past a sign that reads, Thank you for 75 years, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS425
01:15:08,00 --> 01:15:13,50
and walks slowly past the metal sign on the wall which says, "New Hampshire greetings, greeting the world one card at a time". 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS428
01:15:14,00 --> 01:15:18,50
Day 450. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS429
01:15:32,00 --> 01:15:37,50
SOMEONE in her football kit, studies her brother. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS430
01:15:35,00 --> 01:15:40,50
He's drawn a girl holding a dagger dripping blood. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS431
01:16:12,00 --> 01:16:18,50
Brother and sister look at one another, then SOMEONE pats SOMEONE on the shoulder and goes back to her teammates. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS433
01:16:21,00 --> 01:16:26,50
SOMEONE stares into the middle distance and remembers times with SOMEONE walking down the street. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS435
01:16:25,00 --> 01:16:29,50
He remembers her by the photocopiers, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS437
01:16:29,00 --> 01:16:33,50
He remembers holding hands in Ikea, laughing in the car. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS439
01:16:33,00 --> 01:16:38,50
the punch up in the cocktail bar, SOMEONE coming around in the rain to apologize. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS442
01:16:41,00 --> 01:16:45,50
Lying in bed and talking, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS443
01:16:43,00 --> 01:16:47,50
and sitting in a restaurant. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS444
01:16:58,00 --> 01:17:03,50
They sit, barely looking at one another. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS445
01:17:01,00 --> 01:17:06,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE in her wedding dress, sit in the back of the bus in the last scene from The Graduate, which SOMEONE and SOMEONE are watching in the cinema. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS448
01:17:10,00 --> 01:17:15,50
On screen, the characters' excited smiles fade. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS449
01:17:21,00 --> 01:17:25,50
SOMEONE stares straight ahead and SOMEONE glances at him. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS450
01:17:23,00 --> 01:17:27,50
She's crying. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS453
01:17:43,00 --> 01:17:48,50
SOMEONE walks off. SOMEONE follows her. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS454
01:17:45,00 --> 01:17:50,50
Later they're in the music store. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS455
01:18:00,00 --> 01:18:05,50
SOMEONE nods unconvincingly. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS456
01:18:03,00 --> 01:18:08,50
SOMEONE finds the Ringo Starr record. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS457
01:18:09,00 --> 01:18:14,50
SOMEONE gives a tight smile and walks away from the 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS458
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:15,50
record stand. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS459
01:18:13,00 --> 01:18:17,50
SOMEONE reaches out to take her hand 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS460
01:18:15,00 --> 01:18:18,50
but she pulls away. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS461
01:18:20,00 --> 01:18:24,50
With a disappointed sigh, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS462
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:26,50
SOMEONE follows SOMEONE out of the shop. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS463
01:18:34,00 --> 01:18:39,50
SOMEONE purses her lips. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS464
01:18:45,00 --> 01:18:49,50
She leans forward and kisses him 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS465
01:18:47,00 --> 01:18:51,50
on the cheek. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS466
01:18:49,00 --> 01:18:53,50
He processes this for a moment 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS467
01:18:51,00 --> 01:18:55,50
then manages a smile. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS469
01:19:01,00 --> 01:19:08,50
Day 450 becomes days 456 to 476. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS470
01:19:06,00 --> 01:19:10,50
SOMEONE's lying on his bed 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS471
01:19:07,00 --> 01:19:12,50
despondently bouncing a tennis ball on the floor. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS472
01:19:21,00 --> 01:19:26,50
SOMEONE bounces the ball in time to the banging. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS473
01:19:24,00 --> 01:19:29,50
He tears down all the sketches and notes from his bedroom wall. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS474
01:19:35,00 --> 01:19:42,50
He stands back examining the clean wall and the piles of paper on the floor. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS475
01:19:40,00 --> 01:19:45,50
SOMEONE sits in an easy chair in a coffee lounge reading a book. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS476
01:19:43,00 --> 01:19:49,50
There's a pile of books on architecture on the coffee table in front of him. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS478
01:19:48,00 --> 01:19:51,50
He is wearing a suit 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS479
01:19:49,00 --> 01:19:53,50
and carrying a portfolio. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS480
01:19:55,00 --> 01:20:02,50
SOMEONE talks to the security guard on the desk who takes the portfolio from him. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS481
01:20:01,00 --> 01:20:07,50
SOMEONE despondently ends a call on his mobile. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS482
01:20:04,00 --> 01:20:10,50
He's chalked architectural firms names on his wall. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS483
01:20:07,00 --> 01:20:11,50
There are lines through many of them. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS484
01:20:09,00 --> 01:20:13,50
He chalks lines through four more. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS485
01:20:14,00 --> 01:20:19,50
Using chalks and a long ruler, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS486
01:20:16,00 --> 01:20:22,50
SOMEONE creates a design on the dark bedroom wall. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS487
01:20:22,00 --> 01:20:29,50
He carefully rules lines and shades in areas of the design. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS488
01:20:30,00 --> 01:20:36,50
He draws in his sketchbook, looking at the city skyline from a rooftop. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS489
01:20:33,00 --> 01:20:38,50
At night, the skyline shimmers with lights. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS491
01:20:38,00 --> 01:20:43,50
Nighttime traffic is a blur of speeded up light. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS492
01:20:43,00 --> 01:20:51,50
SOMEONE copies a city design onto the bedroom drawing. Nighttime traffic continues to blur through the city at super speed. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS493
01:20:52,00 --> 01:20:57,50
SOMEONE stands back and appraises the complex skyline 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS494
01:20:54,00 --> 01:20:59,50
which is his bedroom artwork. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS495
01:20:57,00 --> 01:21:02,50
SOMEONE's being fitted for a wedding dress. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS496
01:21:01,00 --> 01:21:06,50
The chiffon veil is lowered over SOMEONE's face. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS497
01:21:04,00 --> 01:21:08,50
SOMEONE travels on a bus. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS498
01:21:09,00 --> 01:21:15,50
As SOMEONE sits gloomily on the bus, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS499
01:21:12,00 --> 01:21:17,50
SOMEONE smiles under her veil. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS500
01:21:15,00 --> 01:21:19,50
It's lifted from her face 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS501
01:21:18,00 --> 01:21:22,50
and she kisses her new husband. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS502
01:21:22,00 --> 01:21:27,50
SOMEONE stares blankly on the bus. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS503
01:21:28,00 --> 01:21:34,50
Day 488. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS504
01:21:37,00 --> 01:21:42,50
SOMEONE wearing his suit, reaches pavement level on an escalator. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS505
01:21:42,00 --> 01:21:45,50
He stares expressionlessly out across a leafy park. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS507
01:21:49,00 --> 01:21:53,50
he sits on his favorite bench. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS508
01:21:51,00 --> 01:21:56,50
He sits up. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS509
01:21:53,00 --> 01:21:58,50
SOMEONE's sitting on a bench a short distance away 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS510
01:21:59,00 --> 01:22:03,50
wearing a dark skirt and a raincoat. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS512
01:23:10,00 --> 01:23:15,50
she strolls down towards him. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS513
01:23:12,00 --> 01:23:16,50
They sit awkwardly, side by side. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS514
01:23:40,00 --> 01:23:44,50
Becoming serious, he stares at her. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS516
01:24:23,00 --> 01:24:27,50
She smiles and looks away. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS517
01:24:24,00 --> 01:24:28,50
Hurt, he looks away from her. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS518
01:25:56,00 --> 01:26:02,50
She self-consciously brushes her hair away from her face. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS519
01:26:13,00 --> 01:26:18,50
They sit together looking out at the city. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS520
01:26:16,00 --> 01:26:20,50
She places her hand on his 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS521
01:26:18,00 --> 01:26:22,50
with a pained expression. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS522
01:26:20,00 --> 01:26:24,50
He looks down at her diamond ring 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS523
01:26:22,00 --> 01:26:26,50
He studies her face. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS524
01:26:24,00 --> 01:26:28,50
She gives his hand a squeeze. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS525
01:26:35,00 --> 01:26:40,50
She gives him a pat on the back 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS526
01:26:37,00 --> 01:26:41,50
She walks off. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS527
01:26:50,00 --> 01:26:54,50
She smiles sweetly at him, 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS529
01:26:54,00 --> 01:26:58,50
She goes. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS530
01:27:00,00 --> 01:27:04,50
SOMEONE stands, looking at the skyline 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS531
01:27:02,00 --> 01:27:07,50
then sits back down on the bench. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS532
01:27:09,00 --> 01:27:13,50
Day 500. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS533
01:27:11,00 --> 01:27:17,50
SOMEONE walks on a tiled floor through a large airy old office building 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS535
01:27:42,00 --> 01:27:47,50
SOMEONE takes a seat on a balustraded balcony area. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS536
01:27:45,00 --> 01:27:49,50
A young woman is on a sofa also, waiting. 

500DAYSOFSUMMER_DVS537
