A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS42
00:03:19,00 --> 00:03:29,50
A young man saunters out of a parked blue van and hides something in the rear tire well. The motorcycle whizzes through an empty parking structure. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS47
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:39,50
The young man uses a payphone. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS48
00:03:37,00 --> 00:03:44,50
He hangs up and crosses the street toward a colored blue-lit nightclub. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS49
00:03:42,00 --> 00:03:50,50
Now, a shapely brunette gets off the motorcycle and unzips her leather body suit. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS50
00:03:47,00 --> 00:03:53,50
Outside the club, the man takes off his jacket. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS51
00:03:50,00 --> 00:03:57,50
Now, the brunette enters a large modern apartment and approaches SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS52
00:03:55,00 --> 00:04:00,50
Now, a hand raps on a metal door. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS53
00:03:57,00 --> 00:04:05,50
A tiny window opens, a chef takes a scrap of paper and lets the young man in. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS54
00:04:02,00 --> 00:04:10,50
At waist level, we follow him as he walks past a scantily clad woman and into the kitchen. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS55
00:04:08,00 --> 00:04:15,50
Without breaking his stride, he lifts a napkin on the counter and takes a gun hidden beneath it. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS58
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:22,50
Through a curtain, the young man enters the hopping nightclub. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS59
00:04:19,00 --> 00:04:27,50
In a booth, a man sits with several young beauties. SOMEONE nuzzles the brunette's hair. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS63
00:04:36,00 --> 00:04:40,50
The young man faces the man in the booth. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS64
00:04:39,00 --> 00:04:43,50
SOMEONE makes a call. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS68
00:04:49,00 --> 00:04:54,50
He raises his gun to the man in the booth. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS71
00:04:54,00 --> 00:05:01,50
The young man shoots him in the chest. Someone tackles him and our view cuts to black. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS76
00:05:06,00 --> 00:05:12,50
Bullets tear a hole through the backside of a paper target. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS77
00:05:09,00 --> 00:05:15,50
The target glides forward to reveal SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS78
00:05:12,00 --> 00:05:19,50
Setting his weapon down, the aging bald cop removes his protective glasses. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS79
00:05:18,00 --> 00:05:23,50
SOMEONE faces a man with a badge around his neck. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS80
00:05:27,00 --> 00:05:33,50
Leaning next to the cop, SOMEONE looks at a file in his hand. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS81
00:05:38,00 --> 00:05:43,50
SOMEONE gives him a cool sidelong glance. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS82
00:06:22,00 --> 00:06:28,50
SOMEONE's stony expression softens as he shifts his gaze. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS83
00:06:45,00 --> 00:06:50,50
SOMEONE tilts his head and leans toward his friend. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS84
00:06:55,00 --> 00:07:02,50
Now at the airport, SOMEONE sits in the passenger seat of a silver Sedan. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS85
00:07:06,00 --> 00:07:12,50
He and SOMEONE share a smile, then look away. She paces. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS86
00:07:14,00 --> 00:07:20,50
She looks at SOMEONE as he stares out the windshield. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS87
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:24,50
She starts to speak then swallows. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS88
00:07:25,00 --> 00:07:31,50
She hands him a Moscow travel guide. SOMEONE smirks as he takes it. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS89
00:07:52,00 --> 00:07:56,50
She raises her eyebrows slightly. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS90
00:07:54,00 --> 00:07:58,50
Her father gives her a half smile. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS91
00:08:01,00 --> 00:08:07,50
He gets out of the car with a small bag and shuts the door. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS92
00:08:04,00 --> 00:08:10,50
SOMEONE walks underneath the sign that reads Aeroflot. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS93
00:08:10,00 --> 00:08:16,50
Later a jumbo jet sails above the cloud. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS94
00:08:16,00 --> 00:08:21,50
Inside the plane, the name atop a file reads, SOMEONE opens it. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS96
00:08:20,00 --> 00:08:24,50
By the dim light above his seat, he peruses the documents written in Russian. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS99
00:08:28,00 --> 00:08:34,50
He flips past paperwork and uncovers a mug shot of his son. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS100
00:08:31,00 --> 00:08:37,50
Looking it over, the heartened detective inhales deeply. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS101
00:08:34,00 --> 00:08:39,50
He lingers on the mug shot. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS102
00:08:39,00 --> 00:08:45,50
Later in the dark, he reclines in his seat and shuts his eyes. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS103
00:08:51,00 --> 00:08:56,50
Now, a man's cuffed hands rest folded on a table. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS104
00:08:54,00 --> 00:09:00,50
Another man slaps a file down next to an ashtray. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS105
00:08:57,00 --> 00:09:02,50
Wearing a suit and ID card, he sits across in front of the prisoner. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS107
00:09:01,00 --> 00:09:07,50
He looks at the file, then takes out a pack of cigarettes. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS108
00:09:04,00 --> 00:09:09,50
The prisoner, SOMEONE's son, watches him light up. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS111
00:09:22,00 --> 00:09:26,50
The man in the suit studies him. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS113
00:09:25,00 --> 00:09:30,50
He takes a drag off his cigarette. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS118
00:09:45,00 --> 00:09:49,50
The men stare at each other. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS119
00:09:50,00 --> 00:09:57,50
Now, congested traffic trickles along one side of a massively wide avenue. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS120
00:09:55,00 --> 00:10:03,50
SOMEONE sits in the back of a taxi with a tense brow staring at scribbled notes about his son's arrest. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS121
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:07,50
His eyes scan over a Russian detective's phone number and settle on Groginski. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS123
00:10:05,00 --> 00:10:10,50
which he outlined in red ink. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS124
00:10:07,00 --> 00:10:13,50
Reading from the guidebook, he addresses the driver. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS125
00:10:18,00 --> 00:10:24,50
The driver glances back with a quizzical frown. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS126
00:10:44,00 --> 00:10:48,50
SOMEONE looks out the windshield. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS127
00:11:15,00 --> 00:11:20,50
Grinning, the driver lifts his hand. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS128
00:12:19,00 --> 00:12:23,50
SOMEONE exits the cab. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS129
00:12:27,00 --> 00:12:33,50
Elsewhere, police vehicles surround a parked prisoner transport truck. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS130
00:12:30,00 --> 00:12:39,50
Uniformed Russian soldiers along with an armed guard in a ski mask, escort SOMEONE and SOMEONE to the truck. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS132
00:12:39,00 --> 00:12:43,50
Riding inside, SOMEONE glances at the young criminal, who stares back with a blank piercing 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS134
00:12:41,00 --> 00:12:51,50
Elsewhere, three black Sedans move through an alley, barely wide enough for cars. Outside the courthouse, hundreds of protesters gather. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS135
00:12:54,00 --> 00:12:58,50
SOMEONE strolls through the chaos. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS136
00:13:01,00 --> 00:13:09,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE walks through a dim arched hallway. The three Sedans travel a street along a river. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS137
00:13:07,00 --> 00:13:13,50
Fixing his suit jacket he continues downstairs. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS138
00:13:10,00 --> 00:13:18,50
At the courthouse, two police motorcycles lead the heavily guarded motorcade to the front entrance. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS139
00:13:16,00 --> 00:13:22,50
SOMEONE stands alone nearby, with protesters marching behind him. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS140
00:13:20,00 --> 00:13:24,50
As a policeman opens the truck, uniformed soldiers escort the prisoners out. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS142
00:13:24,00 --> 00:13:29,50
SOMEONE sneers at the crowd. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS143
00:13:26,00 --> 00:13:32,50
The black Sedans continue in an evenly spaced line. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS144
00:13:30,00 --> 00:13:37,50
As the soldiers escort the prisoners along the barricaded path, SOMEONE spots his son. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS145
00:13:43,00 --> 00:13:48,50
SOMEONE remains still with his brow tense, 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS146
00:13:45,00 --> 00:13:50,50
as he watches his son reach the courthouse stairs. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS147
00:13:48,00 --> 00:13:53,50
His softening gaze slowly drifts to the ground. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS148
00:13:54,00 --> 00:14:01,50
The prisoners continue through two lines of darkly clad armed guards. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS149
00:13:58,00 --> 00:14:05,50
Inside, a crowded courtroom erupts as the soldiers escort the man. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS150
00:14:06,00 --> 00:14:10,50
Quiet. Order in the courtroom. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS151
00:14:11,00 --> 00:14:18,50
The soldiers place SOMEONE and SOMEONE in adjacent thick glass holding cells. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS152
00:14:15,00 --> 00:14:20,50
Order in the courtroom. Order. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS153
00:14:18,00 --> 00:14:23,50
The judge faces a soldier. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS154
00:14:21,00 --> 00:14:25,50
They seal the doors. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS155
00:14:23,00 --> 00:14:28,50
Uniformed soldiers seal every exit. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS156
00:14:27,00 --> 00:14:34,50
From overhead, the three black Sedans round the corner and continue down a one-way street. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS157
00:14:32,00 --> 00:14:37,50
Outside the courthouse, SOMEONE slowly tilts his head. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS158
00:14:35,00 --> 00:14:42,50
He watches a large armored truck, reverse behind a building corner at the end of the block. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS159
00:14:40,00 --> 00:14:46,50
Shifting his gaze, SOMEONE's eyes linger on its protruding front end. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS160
00:14:44,00 --> 00:14:50,50
In the truck, a dark-haired man checks the timer on his watch. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS161
00:14:47,00 --> 00:14:54,50
Two masked snipers dressed in all black, survey from the courthouse rooftop, 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS162
00:14:51,00 --> 00:14:57,50
as the Sedans arrive at the military checkpoint. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS163
00:14:59,00 --> 00:15:06,50
In the courtroom, the prisoners stand attentively in their holding cells. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS164
00:15:03,00 --> 00:15:08,50
SOMEONE glances over at SOMEONE's son. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS165
00:15:06,00 --> 00:15:13,50
Using a rounded mirror on a pole, a soldier checks the underside of the first Sedan, 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS166
00:15:10,00 --> 00:15:15,50
then quickly moves on to the second. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS167
00:15:12,00 --> 00:15:18,50
The windshield's glare conceals the driver's face. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS168
00:15:17,00 --> 00:15:24,50
The prisoners simultaneously sit in their adjacent glass cells, and SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS169
00:15:22,00 --> 00:15:27,50
Slowly turning, SOMEONE connects with his glaring eyes. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS170
00:15:25,00 --> 00:15:30,50
The old man averts his gaze and faces the courtroom. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS171
00:15:31,00 --> 00:15:38,50
At the checkpoint, the soldier finishes searching the third Sedan and waves them through. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS172
00:15:36,00 --> 00:15:41,50
SOMEONE steps toward the crowd of protesters. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS174
00:15:40,00 --> 00:15:47,50
As the checkpoint bar rises, the black Sedans enter the restricted area beneath the rooftop snipers. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS175
00:15:46,00 --> 00:15:53,50
They round a raised curb by a side entrance and park in a line along the courthouse. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS176
00:15:52,00 --> 00:15:57,50
The dark-haired man holds out his hand. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS177
00:15:56,00 --> 00:16:00,50
His bearded driver glances up. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS179
00:16:02,00 --> 00:16:06,50
The man casually chews gum. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS180
00:16:05,00 --> 00:16:13,50
The driver reluctantly hands his boss a cellphone detonator with wires and electronics taped on. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS181
00:16:10,00 --> 00:16:17,50
The three Sedans remain still as the court session continues inside. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS182
00:16:16,00 --> 00:16:22,50
Behind him, armed men in body armor and gas masks fill the truck. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS183
00:16:19,00 --> 00:16:23,50
The Sedans explode,  

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS185
00:16:24,00 --> 00:16:38,50
blasting through a courtroom wall. SOMEONE rolls on the ground as frantic civilians scatter through the smoke and SOMEONE. Rounding a corner, the armored truck barrels toward the blast point. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS186
00:16:35,00 --> 00:16:41,50
SOMEONE climbs to his feet and jumps through the chaos. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS187
00:16:43,00 --> 00:16:50,50
Inside, SOMEONE kicks the grate off his cell and finds SOMEONE hunched next to his. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS188
00:16:48,00 --> 00:16:53,50
The armored truck parks beside the charred Sedans, 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS189
00:16:51,00 --> 00:16:55,50
and the masked men pour out the back. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS190
00:16:53,00 --> 00:16:59,50
SOMEONE helps SOMEONE to his feet, as the men rush inside the building. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS191
00:16:56,00 --> 00:17:02,50
A masked man tosses a duffel bag to his dark-haired boss. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS192
00:17:01,00 --> 00:17:06,50
SOMEONE leaps a half wall and faces SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS193
00:17:05,00 --> 00:17:11,50
Come on, come on, come on now. The masked men charge up the stairs. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS195
00:17:11,00 --> 00:17:16,50
SOMEONE leads SOMEONE down a dark corridor. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS196
00:17:14,00 --> 00:17:21,50
Sitting up, an injured soldier reaches for his weapon as the masked men enter. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS197
00:17:19,00 --> 00:17:24,50
They shoot the soldier without hesitation. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS199
00:17:25,00 --> 00:17:30,50
Outside, the view through the smoke-filled air. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS200
00:17:27,00 --> 00:17:33,50
SOMEONE emerges through the haze, gripping SOMEONE's handcuffs. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS201
00:17:31,00 --> 00:17:36,50
The old man struggles to break free. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS203
00:17:34,00 --> 00:17:41,50
SOMEONE grabs a pistol from a deceased officer and pushes SOMEONE forward. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS204
00:17:38,00 --> 00:17:45,50
In the courtroom, the masked men scour the SOMEONE, aiming flashlight-mounted rifles. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS205
00:17:43,00 --> 00:17:49,50
Their boss finds the glass cells with no one inside. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS206
00:17:46,00 --> 00:17:51,50
They continue searching as the masked brunette enters. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS207
00:17:49,00 --> 00:17:54,50
A hanging florescent light flickers behind her. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS209
00:17:58,00 --> 00:18:06,50
The masked woman mercilessly executes an injured civilian and pieces of ceiling sprinkle down. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS210
00:18:03,00 --> 00:18:10,50
She slowly proceeds through the room, stopping beside the dark-haired boss. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS213
00:18:17,00 --> 00:18:25,50
A squad car speeds by SOMEONE and SOMEONE. As SOMEONE starts away, SOMEONE pulls him toward the blue van. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS216
00:18:26,00 --> 00:18:31,50
the woman follows the dark-haired man outside. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS219
00:18:35,00 --> 00:18:42,50
With SOMEONE in the passenger seat, he reverses on to the street. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS221
00:18:42,00 --> 00:18:46,50
He tosses SOMEONE a jacket. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS225
00:18:48,00 --> 00:18:54,50
SOMEONE blocks the van, and SOMEONE slams on the brakes. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS226
00:18:52,00 --> 00:18:56,50
His eyes widen. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS227
00:18:56,00 --> 00:19:03,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE hurries down a debris-covered street, as two of his armed men flank him. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS228
00:19:03,00 --> 00:19:09,50
Moving to the driver's door, SOMEONE pulls on the locked handle. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS229
00:19:09,00 --> 00:19:14,50
SOMEONE exits the van and looks about. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS230
00:19:14,00 --> 00:19:19,50
Spinning around, SOMEONE spots the van nearby.

00:19:24,00 --> 00:19:28,50
SOMEONE hops out. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS235
00:19:31,00 --> 00:19:35,50
SOMEONE drags SOMEONE back and SOMEONE's 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS236
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:37,50
small thug fires. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS237
00:19:35,00 --> 00:19:41,50
We need him alive. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS238
00:19:38,00 --> 00:19:43,50
SOMEONE aims at his father's head. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS239
00:19:45,00 --> 00:19:50,50
Glaring, SOMEONE shakes his head. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS240
00:19:48,00 --> 00:19:53,50
He backs toward the van. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS241
00:19:52,00 --> 00:20:03,50
SOMEONE gets inside as the armored truck reaches SOMEONE. He and his men hurry inside. SOMEONE takes off, leaving his father on the street.

00:20:10,00 --> 00:20:24,50
SOMEONE eyes the truck in his rear view mirror as he drives over a cobblestone courtyard. The truck follows, smashing through a cement monument. Returning to the street, it sideswipes a car. SOMEONE gets in a flatbed truck. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS244
00:20:22,00 --> 00:20:26,50
A man chases him. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS245
00:20:27,00 --> 00:20:35,50
SOMEONE swarms through traffic. Reaching over, he grabs an earpiece from the glove box and puts it on. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS246
00:20:35,00 --> 00:20:39,50
In an Ops room. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS247
00:20:39,00 --> 00:20:44,50
A drone soars through the sky. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS248
00:20:50,00 --> 00:20:55,50
The armored truck sends a parked car flying. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS249
00:21:24,00 --> 00:21:28,50
The drone changes course. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS250
00:21:40,00 --> 00:21:46,50
Moscow police swarm the massive Garden Ring Avenue. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS251
00:21:51,00 --> 00:21:58,50
SOMEONE takes a hard right turn. In the flatbed truck, SOMEONE weaves through traffic. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS252
00:21:56,00 --> 00:22:05,50
As SOMEONE speeds through a stop sign, an intersecting car slides sideways and gets hit head-on by another.

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS254
00:22:08,00 --> 00:22:17,50
As the van spins a 180 degrees, SOMEONE's truck pushes a sideway Sedan into his front end. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS255
00:22:14,00 --> 00:22:20,50
Face-to-face, the truck forces SOMEONE backwards.

SOMEONE smashes into the armored truck's rear end. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS257
00:22:23,00 --> 00:22:30,50
Reversing, SOMEONE whips around and drives off with a determined stare. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS258
00:22:30,00 --> 00:22:34,50
The armored truck quickly follows. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS259
00:22:31,00 --> 00:22:38,50
Switching gears, SOMEONE releases the clutch and peels out after them. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS260
00:22:36,00 --> 00:22:49,50
The chase continues on a narrow street between two rows of cars parked on an angle. SOMEONE barely evades collisions as the armored truck smashes into every single rear end. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS262
00:22:50,00 --> 00:22:55,50
SOMEONE's bearded driver narrows his eyes. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS263
00:22:52,00 --> 00:22:59,50
As SOMEONE follows, his truck rips off the open door of a parked car.

00:22:56,00 --> 00:23:03,50
SOMEONE takes an abrupt U-turn on to an onramp for a Riverside Avenue. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS265
00:23:00,00 --> 00:23:08,50
As the truck follows, it clips the Sedan and sends it soaring off the ramp onto the street below. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS266
00:23:05,00 --> 00:23:10,50
SOMEONE struggles to make the sharp U-turn. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS268
00:23:13,00 --> 00:23:22,50
A hundred yards ahead, the armored truck speeds down the street. Further on, SOMEONE leads the way, weaving through oncoming traffic. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS269
00:23:19,00 --> 00:23:24,50
He narrowly misses a Sedan.

00:23:33,00 --> 00:23:37,50
He continues down an onramp. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS274
00:23:35,00 --> 00:23:44,50
Following, the armored truck hits a car and fishtails around another. SOMEONE keeps his flatbed right on their heels.

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS277
00:23:50,00 --> 00:23:57,50
Beneath an overpass, a car evades SOMEONE and hits the wall. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS278
00:23:54,00 --> 00:23:59,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE in his side mirror. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS279
00:24:01,00 --> 00:24:07,50
A man emerges from the roof with an RPG and aims at SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS280
00:24:04,00 --> 00:24:14,50
SOMEONE pulls the emergency brake and as he spins, the rocket soars over his flatbed and strikes a garbage truck. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS281
00:24:11,00 --> 00:24:20,50
Spinning out of control, SOMEONE's truck rams off a motorcycle and barrel rolls over a line of parked cars. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS282
00:24:22,00 --> 00:24:29,50
The tail end flips upward and the truck comes down perfectly on its wheels. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS283
00:24:31,00 --> 00:24:36,50
Climbing down, SOMEONE lands hard on his back. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS284
00:24:34,00 --> 00:24:38,50
The aging man grimaces. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS285
00:24:36,00 --> 00:24:44,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE continues down a highway, shifting his glaring eyes between his mirror and the road. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS286
00:24:41,00 --> 00:24:45,50
He speeds in to traffic. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS287
00:24:43,00 --> 00:24:48,50
On foot, SOMEONE hurries into a busy street. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS288
00:24:47,00 --> 00:24:54,50
As he attempts to stop swerving cars, an SUV hits him head on. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS289
00:24:55,00 --> 00:25:00,50
Flying off the hood, SOMEONE rolls on the hard pavement. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS290
00:25:01,00 --> 00:25:07,50
A large Russian man exits the SUV, waving his arms.

00:25:11,00 --> 00:25:16,50
SOMEONE rushes in to the man's SUV. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS293
00:25:20,00 --> 00:25:27,50

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS294
00:25:24,00 --> 00:25:30,50
In his mirror, he sees the armored truck right on his tail. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS295
00:25:34,00 --> 00:25:38,50
The bearded driver narrows his eyes. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS296
00:25:36,00 --> 00:25:46,50
He accelerates through the off-ramp's concrete wall, plummeting 15 feet on to a taxi, which launches upward into the overpass. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS297
00:25:46,00 --> 00:26:05,50
SOMEONE glances in his side mirror. On another street, SOMEONE zips through traffic, using both sides of the road. He veers on to the overpass. Looking over, he spots SOMEONE's blue van and the armored truck speeding down the highway below. SOMEONE clenches his jaw. Two cars collide as he screeches to a halt. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS298
00:26:02,00 --> 00:26:08,50
Quickly reversing, he turns the front end toward SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS299
00:26:12,00 --> 00:26:20,50
SOMEONE bursts through the guardrail and down on to a car-hauling tractor-trailer in traffic. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS300
00:26:18,00 --> 00:26:26,50
He bumbles along the entire trailer to a lower level and crushes a red sports car. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS301
00:26:23,00 --> 00:26:31,50
Ramping off the end, SOMEONE continues on top of more tractor-trailers stuck in standstill traffic. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS302
00:26:37,00 --> 00:26:44,50
He drives out of a gravel truck and onto the tops of civilian cars. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS304
00:26:44,00 --> 00:26:52,50
Crushing windshields, SOMEONE barrels over several more vehicles, then jumps the center barrier. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS305
00:26:50,00 --> 00:26:57,50
Speeds away from the halted traffic and continues the pursuit. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS306
00:26:56,00 --> 00:27:01,50
Checking his mirror, SOMEONE takes an off-ramp. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS307
00:26:58,00 --> 00:27:07,50
He quickly soars on to another highway, as the armored truck closes in. The truck hits the van's rear. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS308
00:27:05,00 --> 00:27:10,50
Struggling, SOMEONE regains control of the wheel. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS309
00:27:08,00 --> 00:27:16,50
SOMEONE's truck accelerates beside the van and performs a pit maneuver, spinning SOMEONE out of control. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS310
00:27:19,00 --> 00:27:25,50
Clenching his jaw, SOMEONE yanks at the wheel as the van wildly spins. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS311
00:27:23,00 --> 00:27:30,50
The truck's front end connects with the van's side and bulldozes it down the highway. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS312
00:27:28,00 --> 00:27:33,50
Glancing over, SOMEONE thrusts his middle finger toward SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS313
00:27:35,00 --> 00:27:40,50
SOMEONE advances in the SUV. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS314
00:27:42,00 --> 00:27:50,50
SOMEONE keeps his eyes on the armored truck ahead, rapidly approaching he collides with the rear end. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS315
00:27:51,00 --> 00:27:58,50
He hits the truck again and SOMEONE's van spins away, passing by SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS316
00:28:06,00 --> 00:28:11,50
SOMEONE glances back at the van. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS317
00:28:13,00 --> 00:28:18,50
SOMEONE accelerates beside the armored truck. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS318
00:28:19,00 --> 00:28:26,50
He swerves repeatedly into the truck's side, and smoke billows from its front end. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS319
00:28:24,00 --> 00:28:29,50
The vehicles separate around a civilian car. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS320
00:28:26,00 --> 00:28:33,50
Gaining control, SOMEONE turns the van with traffic and rejoins the chase. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS321
00:28:31,00 --> 00:28:36,50
SOMEONE keeps his SUV snug against the truck's side. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS322
00:28:35,00 --> 00:28:41,50
SOMEONE forces the truck toward the side of the road. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS323
00:28:44,00 --> 00:28:49,50
With his face tense, SOMEONE gives a final bump. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS324
00:28:47,00 --> 00:28:54,50
The truck rams off a concrete barrier, flipping the massive vehicle through the air. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS325
00:28:51,00 --> 00:28:57,50
The bearded driver screams as they soar off an overpass. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS327
00:28:58,00 --> 00:29:08,50
The truck flies through an enormous concrete drainpipe, toppling the tractor-trailer carrying it. On its side, SOMEONE's SUV slides to a stop. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS328
00:29:09,00 --> 00:29:14,50
The armored truck topples over. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS329
00:29:12,00 --> 00:29:18,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE drives the van with a weary glare. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS330
00:29:20,00 --> 00:29:33,50
Pressing his lips together, he steers the van in a U-turn across the highway. At the overturned SUV, SOMEONE kicks the windshield from its frame. He struggles to pull himself out and on to his feet. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS331
00:29:35,00 --> 00:29:41,50
Steam wafts from the engine as he clears the vehicle. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS332
00:29:38,00 --> 00:29:44,50
Below, SOMEONE and his men recover from their collision. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS333
00:29:41,00 --> 00:29:48,50
On the overpass, SOMEONE hurdles a low barrier and cuts across traffic. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS334
00:29:47,00 --> 00:29:55,50
He stays the cars with an outstretched hand. Below, a police cruiser arrives at the crash site. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS335
00:29:52,00 --> 00:29:58,50
As the door opens, SOMEONE shoots the officers inside. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS336
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:07,50
SOMEONE fires up at SOMEONE, who ducks behind the metal railings. His son pulls up beside him. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS337
00:30:10,00 --> 00:30:14,50
SOMEONE obeys. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS338
00:30:13,00 --> 00:30:21,50
SOMEONE pulls away, leaving SOMEONE behind and darts through traffic. SOMEONE rides in back, holding on to a pole. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS339
00:30:53,00 --> 00:30:57,50
On a walkway, SOMEONE uses a phone. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS354
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:34,50
Now, in a dim ramshackle hallway, standing with SOMEONE and SOMEONE, SOMEONE beckons SOMEONE over. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS355
00:31:32,00 --> 00:31:38,50
As he joins the others, his son leads SOMEONE into the safe house. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS356
00:31:36,00 --> 00:31:40,50
SOMEONE uses a cellphone. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS357
00:32:01,00 --> 00:32:05,50
SOMEONE takes in the setup. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS358
00:32:06,00 --> 00:32:11,50
His son picks his handcuffs open. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS359
00:32:33,00 --> 00:32:38,50
SOMEONE changes clothes. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS360
00:32:39,00 --> 00:32:44,50
SOMEONE tucks a fresh shirt into his pants. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS361
00:32:48,00 --> 00:32:54,50
Pausing, SOMEONE faces SOMEONE who wears a solemn gaze. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS362
00:33:00,00 --> 00:33:05,50
SOMEONE takes passports from a safe. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS363
00:33:26,00 --> 00:33:33,50
SOMEONE checks an ammo cartridge in the handle of a small switchblade. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS364
00:33:31,00 --> 00:33:37,50
SOMEONE cocks his head. SOMEONE takes a deep breath then faces. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS365
00:33:42,00 --> 00:33:47,50
SOMEONE offers a phone, but holds it back. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS366
00:33:53,00 --> 00:33:58,50
SOMEONE stows the knife in his boot. SOMEONE taps SOMEONE on the arm, signaling the agent to step away with them. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS367
00:33:58,00 --> 00:34:04,50
As they go, SOMEONE dials a number on the borrowed cellphone. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS374
00:34:24,00 --> 00:34:30,50
Glancing aside, he pauses and fixes a grave stare. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS375
00:34:28,00 --> 00:34:33,50
SOMEONE faces his own reflection in a mirrored cabinet. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS377
00:34:42,00 --> 00:34:50,50
A speeding bullet grazes SOMEONE's arm, another tears through SOMEONE's head, killing him. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS378
00:34:48,00 --> 00:34:53,50
Outside, three masked men break a door open. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS379
00:34:52,00 --> 00:34:59,50
SOMEONE sprints across the room and protectively tackles SOMEONE. SOMEONE finds an assault rifle. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS380
00:34:59,00 --> 00:35:11,50
He fires on the men, as his son crawls with SOMEONE across the floor. The intruders drop under the gunfire, but more stream in behind them. Scrambling into the next room, SOMEONE hits a button. A blast consumes the entryway landing, taking several men with it. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS381
00:35:08,00 --> 00:35:15,50
SOMEONE grabs a portable frame. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS385
00:35:16,00 --> 00:35:21,50
As he attaches it to a far wall, we recognize a small detonator at its top. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS386
00:35:19,00 --> 00:35:26,50
The frame blasts a large hole in the wall. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS387
00:35:24,00 --> 00:35:29,50
SOMEONE joins SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS389
00:35:33,00 --> 00:35:37,50
As all three pass through the hole and head through a hall, more gunmen shoot at them. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS390
00:35:38,00 --> 00:35:45,50
Now a bird's eye view shows tightly packed buildings in a city neighborhood. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS392
00:35:48,00 --> 00:35:54,50
As we drift closer, the three men emerge onto a rooftop. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS393
00:35:52,00 --> 00:35:58,50
Wielding a handgun, SOMEONE follows SOMEONE and his son past a scaffold-supported sign. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS394
00:35:55,00 --> 00:36:03,50
They descend a caged ladder. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS395
00:36:04,00 --> 00:36:08,50
Landing first, SOMEONE urges the two older men onward. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS396
00:36:06,00 --> 00:36:11,50
As they arrive in a shadowy market with closed doors, SOMEONE brings SOMEONE to a bench. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS397
00:36:12,00 --> 00:36:19,50
SOMEONE rips off SOMEONE's sleeve and makes a tourniquet. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS398
00:36:24,00 --> 00:36:30,50
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE his jacket. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS399
00:36:32,00 --> 00:36:37,50
SOMEONE hands over his cellphone. SOMEONE drops it on the ground and stomps on it repeatedly, smashing it to pieces. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS400
00:36:52,00 --> 00:37:01,50
SOMEONE lifts his brow wryly. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS401
00:37:00,00 --> 00:37:04,50
SOMEONE checks the gun's chamber and clip, then holsters it in his waistband. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS402
00:37:05,00 --> 00:37:11,50
SOMEONE shifts his exasperated gaze as his son helps SOMEONE to his feet and urges him onward. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS403
00:37:24,00 --> 00:37:32,50
Now, a long passenger train breaks on its tracks. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS404
00:37:34,00 --> 00:37:39,50
Our view lists to take in the station, in the midst of the city. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS405
00:37:37,00 --> 00:37:43,50
Inside, SOMEONE opens a locker and digs through the content. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS406
00:37:40,00 --> 00:37:46,50
He hauls out a bag and slams the locker shut. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS407
00:38:20,00 --> 00:38:26,50
Beneath an over cast sky, we zoom back from the steeple of the Ukraina Hotel. SOMEONE leads his companions to the edge of a construction site. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS408
00:38:23,00 --> 00:38:34,50
Leaning out from hiding and craning his neck, the young agent peers up at the hotel. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS409
00:38:32,00 --> 00:38:39,50
With a resentful sneer, SOMEONE leads SOMEONE with SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS410
00:39:01,00 --> 00:39:06,50
The two older men lean against a construction truck. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS411
00:39:16,00 --> 00:39:22,50
SOMEONE turns his head away, his gaze solemn and distant. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS412
00:39:28,00 --> 00:39:34,50
His arms folded, SOMEONE gives an understanding nod. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS413
00:39:42,00 --> 00:39:48,50
Returning, SOMEONE listens in. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS414
00:39:49,00 --> 00:39:54,50
SOMEONE heaves a regretful sigh and shakes his head as SOMEONE eavesdrops unnoticed. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS415
00:40:01,00 --> 00:40:08,50
SOMEONE blinks thoughtfully, then rejoins the older men. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS416
00:40:15,00 --> 00:40:21,50
The agent retrieves his bag and leads them onward. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS417
00:40:20,00 --> 00:40:25,50
SOMEONE keeps an eye on their surroundings. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS418
00:40:23,00 --> 00:40:28,50
Now in the hotel laundry, the men hide. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS419
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:32,50
SOMEONE approaches a worker. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS420
00:40:51,00 --> 00:40:55,50
SOMEONE pays off the worker and beckons his companion. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS421
00:41:04,00 --> 00:41:10,50
Now, he swipes an employee key card in an elevator's control panel. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS422
00:41:08,00 --> 00:41:14,50
The open doors frame SOMEONE, SOMEONE and SOMEONE as they wait. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS423
00:41:12,00 --> 00:41:18,50
As the door slides shut, SOMEONE digs in his bag and retrieves a shotgun with cartridges stored along the barrel. He hands it off to his father, then readies an assault rifle for use. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS424
00:41:16,00 --> 00:41:28,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE, who lifts his brow sheepishly. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS425
00:41:31,00 --> 00:41:37,50
SOMEONE glances at the Russian and shrugs his head. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS426
00:41:35,00 --> 00:41:40,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS427
00:41:40,00 --> 00:41:43,50
Leaning against the wall, SOMEONE's straightens. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS428
00:41:41,00 --> 00:41:46,50
Now, tall windows in a stained glass ceiling allow weak sunlight into a vast deserted ballroom. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS429
00:41:43,00 --> 00:41:52,50
Dining chairs stand on tables with champagne hued tablecloth. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS430
00:41:49,00 --> 00:41:55,50
Sparkling chandeliers hang from both the ceiling and wooden storage carts on the floor. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS431
00:41:53,00 --> 00:42:01,50
At the far end of the room, 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS432
00:41:58,00 --> 00:42:03,50
a threshold shows the three men venturing through a pair of tall glass doors. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS433
00:42:00,00 --> 00:42:07,50
They cross a brief red-carpeted lobby. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS434
00:42:04,00 --> 00:42:09,50
Then reach the threshold and pause. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS435
00:42:07,00 --> 00:42:11,50
Taking point, SOMEONE cautiously scans his surroundings with his weapon ready, as he leads the others in. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS438
00:42:15,00 --> 00:42:21,50
The tall windows show a fog-enshrouded city outside,as they cross the room. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS441
00:42:35,00 --> 00:42:41,50
From behind stacked chairs,a shapely figure with long dark hair steps into view. Her feature's out of focus. Our view sharpens to reveal SOMEONE's brunette companion. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS443
00:42:42,00 --> 00:42:48,50
She wears a pale blouse and skirt. She hurries toward SOMEONE. With a loving smile, he meets her halfway. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS444
00:42:48,00 --> 00:42:53,50
Embracing, they hold each other tight. With a crooked smirk, SOMEONE faces the Russian. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS446
00:42:59,00 --> 00:43:05,50
The father and daughter part. He caresses her cheek.  

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS449
00:43:22,00 --> 00:43:26,50
His eyes wide, SOMEONE turns his head to face his father. Staying close to her father, SOMEONE notices SOMEONE with a bewildered vulnerable gaze. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS453
00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:22,50
Leaving his daughter, SOMEONE heads toward a window. SOMEONE follows. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS454
00:44:19,00 --> 00:44:23,50
SOMEONE hangs back, keeping an eye on SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS455
00:44:21,00 --> 00:44:26,50
The young woman watches her father with a breathless 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS457
00:44:28,00 --> 00:44:31,50
Keeping his weapon ready, SOMEONE presses his lips together and plants his feet. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS458
00:44:28,00 --> 00:44:35,50
SOMEONE faces him distractedly, then nods. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS459
00:44:36,00 --> 00:44:41,50
SOMEONE gives a skeptical nod. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS460
00:44:40,00 --> 00:44:45,50
At a window, SOMEONE lifts the grated lid from a wooden radiator encasement. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS462
00:44:46,00 --> 00:44:52,50
SOMEONE takes a couple of steps closer to the Russian's daughter. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS463
00:45:05,00 --> 00:45:11,50
Leaning over the encasement, SOMEONE reaches in up to his shoulder. His fingertips brush a small parcel within. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS464
00:45:08,00 --> 00:45:17,50
Gazing out, SOMEONE notices a military grade helicopter parked below. SOMEONE blinks at the older American. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS466
00:45:21,00 --> 00:45:28,50
As SOMEONE pulls out the small bundle, SOMEONE drives into view. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS467
00:45:27,00 --> 00:45:35,50
SOMEONE pushes SOMEONE behind him. Wielding a rifle, SOMEONE beckons a team of armed thugs out to join him. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS468
00:45:37,00 --> 00:45:42,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE sidle back to SOMEONE. Nearby, SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE's men helplessly. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS471
00:45:46,00 --> 00:45:52,50
Facing SOMEONE and the Americans, SOMEONE munches a carrot. SOMEONE gives a cool nod. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS473
00:46:07,00 --> 00:46:12,50
SOMEONE reaches for SOMEONE. She takes him hostage. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS474
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:17,50
She jams a gun into his cheek. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS475
00:46:16,00 --> 00:46:24,50
SOMEONE gestures with a carrot. SOMEONE drops his shotgun and his son reluctantly follows suit. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS476
00:46:22,00 --> 00:46:30,50
With a clenched jaw, SOMEONE faces SOMEONE who glares out at him from behind her father's shoulder. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS477
00:46:27,00 --> 00:46:32,50
SOMEONE signals to two men. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS478
00:46:30,00 --> 00:46:38,50
One zip ties SOMEONE's wrist before him. The other binds SOMEONE's hands behind his back. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS479
00:46:37,00 --> 00:46:42,50
The thugs force the Americans to their knees. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS483
00:46:53,00 --> 00:46:59,50
The beautiful woman leans her lips close to his ear. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS484
00:47:06,00 --> 00:47:12,50
As SOMEONE leaves with SOMEONE, SOMEONE faces SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS485
00:47:22,00 --> 00:47:26,50
He swallows a bite of carrot. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS486
00:47:29,00 --> 00:47:33,50
Stifling a smirk, SOMEONE nods. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS487
00:47:31,00 --> 00:47:38,50
SOMEONE chucks the remaining carrot aside, then launches into a soft shoe dance. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS488
00:47:35,00 --> 00:47:42,50
SOMEONE shoots his father a wry look and SOMEONE sighs patiently. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS489
00:47:39,00 --> 00:47:45,50
Dancing over to the Americans, SOMEONE kicks SOMEONE's gun away. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS490
00:47:44,00 --> 00:47:52,50
He shuffles over to SOMEONE's gun and sweeps it away as well. The Russian gives a shrug. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS491
00:47:52,00 --> 00:47:58,50
SOMEONE lowers his smiling gaze. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS493
00:47:59,00 --> 00:48:05,50
SOMEONE rests his hands on his knees and leans close to the Americans. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS495
00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:13,50
He beats them with his rifle. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS496
00:48:13,00 --> 00:48:19,50
The father and son crumple, but the thugs haul them back on to their knees. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS497
00:48:17,00 --> 00:48:22,50
SOMEONE stares boldly and SOMEONE spits. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS498
00:48:22,00 --> 00:48:30,50
Meanwhile on a rooftop, a bald man escorts SOMEONE and SOMEONE to the military grade chopper. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS500
00:48:38,00 --> 00:48:44,50
In the ballroom, SOMEONE falls from SOMEONE's punches. SOMEONE kicks him hard in his side. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS501
00:48:44,00 --> 00:48:48,50
He backhands SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS502
00:48:48,00 --> 00:48:55,50
SOMEONE surreptitiously reaches for the knife in his boot, as SOMEONE delivers a knee to SOMEONE's face. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS503
00:48:53,00 --> 00:48:59,50
His thugs pick up the men from the floor and set them back on their knees. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS504
00:48:57,00 --> 00:49:02,50
SOMEONE primps his dark curly hair and chews gum. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS505
00:49:06,00 --> 00:49:11,50
SOMEONE sees SOMEONE's knife behind his back. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS506
00:49:10,00 --> 00:49:16,50
SOMEONE works to cut his bonds. SOMEONE glances at the knife and smiles. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS507
00:49:24,00 --> 00:49:29,50
Gazing at his Dad, SOMEONE laughs too. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS508
00:49:40,00 --> 00:49:47,50
As SOMEONE turns to his thugs with a grin, SOMEONE continues sawing at his bond. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS509
00:49:51,00 --> 00:49:56,50
SOMEONE shrugs and approaches SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS510
00:49:55,00 --> 00:50:01,50
SOMEONE cuts his hands free, as SOMEONE lunges at SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS511
00:49:58,00 --> 00:50:03,50
SOMEONE shoots down two thugs with the knife. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS512
00:50:01,00 --> 00:50:06,50
SOMEONE pushes SOMEONE into a crystal chandelier. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS513
00:50:04,00 --> 00:50:12,50
SOMEONE stabs a blonde haired man in the leg, then takes his weapon and uses him as a human shield. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS514
00:50:09,00 --> 00:50:13,50
SOMEONE pummels SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS515
00:50:10,00 --> 00:50:16,50
A man fires at SOMEONE, hitting his blonde comrade. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS516
00:50:13,00 --> 00:50:20,50
The agent fires back, then drops the blonde man's body and runs to his father. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS517
00:50:17,00 --> 00:50:23,50
SOMEONE scoops up a machine gun as he follows. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS518
00:50:20,00 --> 00:50:26,50
SOMEONE rises slightly from the floor and takes aim. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS519
00:50:23,00 --> 00:50:28,50
The Americans leap behind the bar. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS520
00:50:25,00 --> 00:50:30,50
The remaining thugs pelt it with bullets. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS522
00:50:44,00 --> 00:50:49,50
They look up at stained glass skylights. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS523
00:50:47,00 --> 00:50:52,50
The Americans get on their backs and fire up at them. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS524
00:50:50,00 --> 00:50:58,50
The shattered panes send giant glass fragments raining down on the Russians, who cower amid the dust and SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS525
00:50:56,00 --> 00:51:08,50
SOMEONE retreats from the ballroom, as SOMEONE and SOMEONE continue their barrage. They pop up from behind the bar and shoot at the two remaining men, who go down in a storm of bullets. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS526
00:51:05,00 --> 00:51:12,50
As SOMEONE fires a few more bullets, father and son survey the scene. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS527
00:51:09,00 --> 00:51:17,50
Now SOMEONE scurries across the rooftop, to the waiting chopper. The bald man runs up to him. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS528
00:51:16,00 --> 00:51:21,50
They get into the military helicopter. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS529
00:51:18,00 --> 00:51:26,50
Inside the hotel, SOMEONE and SOMEONE jump over the bar and cross the hazy room. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS530
00:51:23,00 --> 00:51:29,50
SOMEONE inspects the area, then jogs over to the window. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS532
00:51:33,00 --> 00:51:40,50
He watches the chopper lift off from the rooftop helipad below. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS533
00:51:44,00 --> 00:51:51,50
At an open side of the chopper, SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit facing out. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS534
00:51:50,00 --> 00:51:56,50
SOMEONE topples a chair as he storms from the window. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS535
00:51:56,00 --> 00:52:03,50
Flying low over city rooftops, the helicopter banks to its left. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS536
00:52:05,00 --> 00:52:13,50
SOMEONE watches as the helicopter makes a graceful wide turn and heads back in the direction of the hotel. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS537
00:52:14,00 --> 00:52:21,50
As it swiftly approaches them, SOMEONE signals to his pacing son. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS538
00:52:18,00 --> 00:52:25,50
The heavily armed vessel looms before the building. SOMEONE reaches for SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS539
00:52:26,00 --> 00:52:36,50
They duck as the chopper bombards the ballroom with its heavy artillery. The rounds tear into the building and lay waste to the interior. The men huddle behind the wall. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS540
00:52:34,00 --> 00:52:40,50
SOMEONE spies scaffolding through a window across the way. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS541
00:52:39,00 --> 00:52:47,50
They scramble to their feet and run through the room. Machine gun fire whizzes by, narrowly missing them. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS543
00:52:48,00 --> 00:52:58,50
The copter pulls left to follow the fleeing men. SOMEONE and SOMEONE run side-by-side, and SOMEONE drops his gun as they take a flying leap out of the window. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS544
00:52:56,00 --> 00:53:02,50
They rip through green netting and crash-land on a wooden platform. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS546
00:53:06,00 --> 00:53:11,50
SOMEONE gets on his feet and looks around. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS547
00:53:10,00 --> 00:53:16,50
They break through the platform and into a red plastic shoot. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS548
00:53:13,00 --> 00:53:20,50
As they slide down, the helicopter gets into position and fires at it. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS549
00:53:17,00 --> 00:53:24,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE plummet through the shoot. Under heavy fire, it falls apart. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS550
00:53:22,00 --> 00:53:32,50
The pair emerge from the tube, and break through several more wooden platforms before landing in a large metal dumpster of cardboard and plastic wrapping. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS551
00:53:30,00 --> 00:53:35,50
The chopper holds position and hovers overhead. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS555
00:53:41,00 --> 00:53:46,50
The chopper makes a hard left turn. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS556
00:53:47,00 --> 00:53:52,50
Below, SOMEONE and SOMEONE get to their feet. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS557
00:53:49,00 --> 00:53:55,50
SOMEONE holds his son's shoulder as they step into the street. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS558
00:53:52,00 --> 00:53:59,50
Dust and SOMEONE drift down over police cars and frightened bystanders. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS559
00:53:56,00 --> 00:54:01,50
The Americans walk past a limping woman. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS560
00:53:59,00 --> 00:54:05,50
They run across an empty street, as a police cruiser whizzes by. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS561
00:54:06,00 --> 00:54:14,50
On the chopper, SOMEONE takes out his phone and makes a call. SOMEONE walks at the head of a large crowd. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS565
00:54:35,00 --> 00:54:44,50
In slow motion, SOMEONE hangs up his phone and leads a pack of lawyers and judges in suits and robes. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS566
00:54:41,00 --> 00:54:49,50
Now, SOMEONE and SOMEONE enter a defunct department store, full of mannequins and dusty display cases. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS567
00:54:46,00 --> 00:54:51,50
SOMEONE limps slightly and SOMEONE staggers. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS568
00:54:49,00 --> 00:54:55,50
He sits on the floor and opens his jacket to look at his side. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS569
00:54:55,00 --> 00:55:01,50
A piece of rebar protrudes from his stomach. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS570
00:55:33,00 --> 00:55:39,50
SOMEONE plucks a piece of glass from the wound in his knee. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS571
00:55:54,00 --> 00:56:00,50
SOMEONE stares thoughtfully ahead, his young face caked with blood. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS572
00:55:58,00 --> 00:56:03,50
He slowly tilts his head back, and his father turns to him. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS573
00:58:17,00 --> 00:58:22,50
He looks at his son with a smirk. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS574
00:58:19,00 --> 00:58:24,50
SOMEONE returns his gaze glumly. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS575
00:58:49,00 --> 00:58:53,50
He reaches over. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS576
00:58:54,00 --> 00:58:59,50
SOMEONE braces himself. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS577
00:58:57,00 --> 00:59:02,50
SOMEONE pulls out rebar and examines. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS578
00:59:06,00 --> 00:59:10,50
SOMEONE looks at the small metal piece, as SOMEONE chucks it aside. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS580
00:59:21,00 --> 00:59:25,50
He helps his son up. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS581
00:59:22,00 --> 00:59:31,50
Now outside a nightclub, green laser lights and strobe flashes illuminate the exterior of the building. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS582
00:59:28,00 --> 00:59:35,50
Nearby, sleek and shiny luxury cars sit in a dark parking lot. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS583
00:59:32,00 --> 00:59:39,50
SOMEONE crouches by the passenger door of a Maserati and attempts to pick the lock. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS584
00:59:37,00 --> 00:59:41,50
His father comes up behind him. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS585
00:59:47,00 --> 00:59:51,50
He shows SOMEONE a set of keys. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS586
00:59:55,00 --> 01:00:00,50
Now they pop the trunk of another car. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS587
00:59:58,00 --> 01:00:03,50
They find a stockpile of guns. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS588
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:17,50
They shut the trunk. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS589
01:00:15,00 --> 01:00:21,50
Now they drive on a rain slicked country road in a Maybach. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS590
01:01:13,00 --> 01:01:20,50
SOMEONE glances at his father. SOMEONE looks away, leaning back in his seat. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS591
01:01:17,00 --> 01:01:22,50
He turns to the passenger window. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS592
01:01:19,00 --> 01:01:26,50
Now, our bird's eye view slowly moves toward the Chernobyl Power Plant. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS593
01:01:23,00 --> 01:01:31,50
A few large lights illuminate the exterior of the facility in an otherwise dark landscape. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS594
01:01:29,00 --> 01:01:35,50
Inside a flashlight shines on a portrait of Gorbachev. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS595
01:01:32,00 --> 01:01:39,50
As our view shifts, the flashlight passes over a high ceilinged open office space. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS596
01:01:37,00 --> 01:01:45,50
A wall of small filing drawers stands in disarray and the smattering of papers litters the floor. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS597
01:01:43,00 --> 01:01:50,50
Their probing light leads back to a group of figures in black hazmat suits. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS601
01:01:56,00 --> 01:02:02,50
Vertical lights flicker on, illuminating a corridor. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS602
01:02:01,00 --> 01:02:05,50
The file is in the inner vault. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS603
01:02:06,00 --> 01:02:11,50
The group led by SOMEONE heads for the corridor. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS604
01:02:14,00 --> 01:02:21,50
They move past the series of tall thin florescent lights in a heavy circular door. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS605
01:02:18,00 --> 01:02:25,50
SOMEONE takes the group deeper into the vault, beyond the set of metal bars. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS606
01:02:23,00 --> 01:02:30,50
As they inspect the area with their flashlights, he faces a wall of safety deposit boxes. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS608
01:02:37,00 --> 01:02:47,50
Now, the Maybach coasts slowly along a dirt road, past a graffitied sign, and several dingy dilapidated structures. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS609
01:02:44,00 --> 01:02:49,50
The car makes a slight left and rolls to a stop. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS610
01:02:56,00 --> 01:03:06,50
As SOMEONE surveys the scene, his son raises a pair of binoculars and focuses them on a group of men in yellow suits outside the plant. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS611
01:03:17,00 --> 01:03:21,50
SOMEONE lowers the binoculars. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS612
01:03:22,00 --> 01:03:25,50
SOMEONE looks at him. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS613
01:03:26,00 --> 01:03:33,50
He returns his gaze to the power plant, where men work frantically and dart about the facility. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS615
01:03:33,00 --> 01:03:38,50
Now inside the plant, SOMEONE stands behind the tall florescence. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS617
01:03:38,00 --> 01:03:44,50
He keeps his gaze and flashlight trained on SOMEONE, who feels along the wall of deposit boxes. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS618
01:03:41,00 --> 01:03:50,50
SOMEONE eyes her father as he slows his pace and glides his hand over box number 475. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS619
01:03:47,00 --> 01:03:53,50
He lightly raps on it then turns to his kidnappers. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS620
01:03:53,00 --> 01:04:01,50
Now, SOMEONE and SOMEONE open the Maybach's trunk, and peruse their stockpile of military grade weaponry. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS621
01:04:02,00 --> 01:04:06,50
They strip down to T-shirts. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS622
01:04:04,00 --> 01:04:12,50
SOMEONE picks up a black leather jacket and puts it on, as SOMEONE dons a combat vest filled with grenades. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS623
01:04:23,00 --> 01:04:27,50
He smiles at SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS624
01:04:25,00 --> 01:04:31,50
SOMEONE reaches into the trunk and hands him a sawed-off shotgun. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS625
01:04:43,00 --> 01:04:50,50
SOMEONE picks up an assault rifle and puts the strap over his head. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS626
01:04:47,00 --> 01:04:53,50
SOMEONE picks up a similar weapon and slings it over his shoulder. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS627
01:04:50,00 --> 01:04:57,50
Standing behind his son, he looks at SOMEONE and his expression softens. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS628
01:04:55,00 --> 01:05:02,50
He pauses and watches the young man, who turns around and stares at his father. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS629
01:05:16,00 --> 01:05:21,50
Looking away, SOMEONE nods a little. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS630
01:05:18,00 --> 01:05:24,50
SOMEONE starts to speak, then stops himself. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS631
01:05:23,00 --> 01:05:28,50
He fixes his gaze on SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS632
01:05:36,00 --> 01:05:41,50
The young man looks away. He opens his mouth and shakes it. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS634
01:05:42,00 --> 01:05:46,50
SOMEONE looks down. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS635
01:05:44,00 --> 01:05:48,50
SOMEONE gazes thoughtfully. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS636
01:05:51,00 --> 01:05:58,50
SOMEONE swallows, and his glassy eyes drift away from SOMEONE toward the ground. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS637
01:06:02,00 --> 01:06:08,50
He smiles at SOMEONE, then playfully lifts his chin in a nod. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS638
01:06:08,00 --> 01:06:14,50
SOMEONE stares at his dad. The two men shake hands. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS639
01:06:16,00 --> 01:06:20,50
SOMEONE shuts the trunk. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS640
01:06:17,00 --> 01:06:26,50
Inside the plant, a drill bores into the deposit box. SOMEONE watches intently from behind his mask. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS641
01:06:24,00 --> 01:06:32,50
SOMEONE shoots him a look. The drill breaks through to the other side, and the operator yanks it open. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS642
01:06:29,00 --> 01:06:36,50
Another man opens the door completely to reveal a seemingly empty shelf. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS643
01:06:33,00 --> 01:06:39,50
SOMEONE leans over and inspects the back wall of the locker. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS644
01:06:36,00 --> 01:06:40,50
He turns around. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS646
01:06:39,00 --> 01:06:45,50
SOMEONE hands him the old bundle from the radiator. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS647
01:06:42,00 --> 01:06:48,50
With gloved hands, SOMEONE unwraps it as SOMEONE watches. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS648
01:06:45,00 --> 01:06:52,50
SOMEONE drops the cloth and paper wrappings, and holds up a dark metal cylinder. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS649
01:06:49,00 --> 01:06:55,50
He slowly turns the base. The cylinder pops open. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS650
01:06:58,00 --> 01:07:05,50
Elsewhere, a dust covered gas mask lies among other piles of decrepit withering SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS651
01:07:03,00 --> 01:07:11,50
SOMEONE cautiously enters in front of his dad, aiming a flashlight-mounted rifle around the decaying room. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS652
01:07:08,00 --> 01:07:13,50
SOMEONE's weapon hangs at his side. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS653
01:07:13,00 --> 01:07:18,50
Scanning the mezzanine level, SOMEONE leads them forward. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS654
01:07:16,00 --> 01:07:23,50
A steady trickle of water drifts in a nearby doorway, as they proceed toward another room. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS655
01:07:22,00 --> 01:07:29,50
In the vault, SOMEONE inserts the cylinder key into a lock at the back of the box. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS657
01:07:31,00 --> 01:07:37,50
Tiny triangular wings pop out of the key. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS658
01:07:34,00 --> 01:07:40,50
Inserting it further, SOMEONE turns the cylinder clockwise, 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS659
01:07:37,00 --> 01:07:45,50
then slides the hands of its curved outer shell together in a perfect match. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS660
01:07:43,00 --> 01:07:50,50
The prisoner twists the key, another quarter turn to the right. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS662
01:07:51,00 --> 01:08:05,50
Two halves of the thick steel wall swing open like doors. A gust of air rustles the papers on the floor. They shine flashlights into the large hidden chamber, revealing dozens of aluminum cases stacked throughout. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS663
01:08:10,00 --> 01:08:16,50
SOMEONE lifts a tablet, reading the levels of radiation. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS665
01:08:25,00 --> 01:08:35,50
Now, a massive cylindrical tank in a steel cage with wheels, hangs beneath the helicopter as it cruises toward the sprawling facility. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS666
01:08:32,00 --> 01:08:42,50
Spotlights illuminate a wide clearing by a building's entrance. Dust swirls as the chopper flies the tank above its landing zone. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS667
01:08:42,00 --> 01:08:52,50
Inside, SOMEONE and his dad cautiously move down a corridor. Outside, the helicopter slowly lowers the tank into position on the ground. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS668
01:08:49,00 --> 01:08:57,50
As the chopper flies away, SOMEONE's men reverse a large eight-wheel vehicle to the tank's hitch. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS669
01:08:55,00 --> 01:09:03,50
Inside, the chopper’s light passes through the corridor windows and illuminates SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS670
01:09:00,00 --> 01:09:06,50
An armed man in a ski mask arrives, and SOMEONE aims. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS671
01:09:05,00 --> 01:09:09,50
SOMEONE takes out a second one. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS672
01:09:08,00 --> 01:09:12,50
SOMEONE creeps forward. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS673
01:09:09,00 --> 01:09:16,50
Outside, the vehicle parks the tank and SOMEONE's men rush towards it. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS675
01:09:21,00 --> 01:09:30,50
Wearing hazmat suits, her men feed hoses into the vault as others enter with flashlight-mounted spraying devices. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS676
01:09:27,00 --> 01:09:37,50
They douse everything with the tank's substance. Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE find a large indoor pool, filled with leaves and dark stagnant water. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS677
01:09:37,00 --> 01:09:41,50
SOMEONE eyes the scummy room. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS678
01:09:40,00 --> 01:09:47,50
In the vault, SOMEONE slowly walks between stacks of the armored cases. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS679
01:09:44,00 --> 01:09:50,50
Watching the radiation levels decrease on her tablet. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS680
01:09:52,00 --> 01:09:59,50
As she reaches the back wall, the tablet readings steadily drop to almost nothing. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS681
01:10:03,00 --> 01:10:10,50
Lifting an arm the fair-skinned beauty carefully removes her gas mask. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS682
01:10:07,00 --> 01:10:13,50
She tilts her head and takes a small slow breath. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS683
01:10:12,00 --> 01:10:19,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE climb a set of stairs to a balcony level overlooking the pool. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS684
01:10:16,00 --> 01:10:23,50
SOMEONE takes a few steps, then leads them up a vertical ladder on the wall. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS685
01:10:20,00 --> 01:10:27,50
SOMEONE opens an armored case, revealing two rows of metallic objects. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS686
01:10:30,00 --> 01:10:34,50
She steps away from SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS687
01:10:35,00 --> 01:10:40,50
SOMEONE forces SOMEONE forward. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS688
01:10:44,00 --> 01:10:49,50
He pushes SOMEONE aside. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS689
01:10:58,00 --> 01:11:03,50
A bullet blasts through SOMEONE's head. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS690
01:11:01,00 --> 01:11:05,50
SOMEONE lowers the gun. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS693
01:11:10,00 --> 01:11:19,50
He empties the clip in SOMEONE's dead body, then connects a hard glare with his daughter's smiling sadistic gaze. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS694
01:11:18,00 --> 01:11:25,50
SOMEONE steps forward and casually tosses the pistol on to the body. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS695
01:11:22,00 --> 01:11:30,50
As SOMEONE saunters across the vault, the muscular bald thug drags SOMEONE's body away. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS702
01:11:47,00 --> 01:11:52,50
Shifting her weight, she approaches her father. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS703
01:11:50,00 --> 01:11:57,50
As she gazes into his eyes, SOMEONE flashes a loving smile and throws her arms around him. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS704
01:11:55,00 --> 01:11:59,50
Separating, their eyes connect. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS706
01:12:02,00 --> 01:12:08,50
She beams as SOMEONE rubs her cheek and steps past.  

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS707
01:12:05,00 --> 01:12:09,50
He turns back with a hardened look. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS710
01:12:09,00 --> 01:12:13,50
Her smile quickly fades. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS713
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:23,50
Outside the entrance, the helicopter touches down in a whirlwind of dust. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS714
01:12:21,00 --> 01:12:27,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE creep along a rooftop with their weapons in hand. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS715
01:12:24,00 --> 01:12:31,50
As they separate, SOMEONE glances over and receives a slight nod from his dad. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS716
01:12:29,00 --> 01:12:36,50
Moving forward, they approach two masked guards, both facing the roof's edge. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS717
01:12:33,00 --> 01:12:40,50
SOMEONE bashes his thug with the butt of his rifle, as SOMEONE slices the other's throat. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS718
01:12:41,00 --> 01:12:50,50
In the vault, one of SOMEONE's men slides a uranium cylinder back into the case and secures the latch. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS719
01:12:47,00 --> 01:12:52,50
Using a walk behind electric forklift, 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS720
01:12:49,00 --> 01:12:55,50
he wheels the case on the path lit by the florescent lights. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS721
01:12:53,00 --> 01:13:00,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE and SOMEONE approach a large block letter sign on the roof's edge. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS722
01:12:57,00 --> 01:13:03,50
They gaze down at all of SOMEONE's men and equipment. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS723
01:13:05,00 --> 01:13:14,50
On the ground, two men carry a case of uranium, as a masked man barks orders. SOMEONE follows his son back across the roof. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS724
01:13:12,00 --> 01:13:17,50
Now, SOMEONE hurries to her dad. SOMEONE hands her father a radio. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS727
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:26,50
He tucks radio into his breast pocket as she runs out of the vault. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS728
01:13:23,00 --> 01:13:31,50
SOMEONE glances toward the doorway then steps forward, shifting his gaze across the room. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS729
01:13:28,00 --> 01:13:37,50
Strolling deeper inside, the elderly man eyes his merchandise and removes glasses from his pocket. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS730
01:13:34,00 --> 01:13:40,50
SOMEONE unfolds the frame and puts them on, as he arrives at SOMEONE's body. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS731
01:13:38,00 --> 01:13:44,50
With an aggressive kick, he rolls the body over and crouches beside it. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS732
01:13:42,00 --> 01:13:49,50
He quickly searches SOMEONE's pockets and pulls a cellphone from his pants, eyeing it closely. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS733
01:13:52,00 --> 01:14:00,50
Now shirtless, the bald muscular thug waves the truck driver on, as he jaunts to the chopper. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS734
01:13:57,00 --> 01:14:01,50
A subordinate hands him a rifle. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS737
01:14:04,00 --> 01:14:12,50
The bald thug cocks the gun and strolls up the chopper's loading ramp into its interior's red glow. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS738
01:14:09,00 --> 01:14:16,50
Turning around, he waves the truck on board as it reverses into position. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS739
01:14:16,00 --> 01:14:21,50
In the vault, SOMEONE holds the phone. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS740
01:14:23,00 --> 01:14:29,50
At a spa, SOMEONE sits up in a steamy massage room. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS741
01:14:27,00 --> 01:14:32,50
The female masseuse hands him a phone and walks away. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS745
01:14:41,00 --> 01:14:45,50
SOMEONE's face tenses. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS755
01:15:06,00 --> 01:15:11,50
The masseur puts him in a chokehold. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS756
01:15:10,00 --> 01:15:15,50
The phone flies from SOMEONE's hand, as he frantically yanks at the hit man's solid grasp. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS757
01:15:13,00 --> 01:15:21,50
His legs flail beneath his white bath towel. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS758
01:15:18,00 --> 01:15:23,50
A sadistic grin spreads on SOMEONE's face as he listens to SOMEONE gurgle his final breath. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS759
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:31,50
The hit man gently lays the body down. SOMEONE releases a triumphant sigh. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS761
01:15:32,00 --> 01:15:40,50
He lowers the phone from his ear and whips it at the wall. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS762
01:15:38,00 --> 01:15:43,50
Outside, SOMEONE exits the chopper. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS766
01:15:50,00 --> 01:15:54,50
SOMEONE moves through the vault. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS767
01:15:52,00 --> 01:15:58,50
The Russian freezes, then turns to face SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS768
01:16:05,00 --> 01:16:10,50
SOMEONE slumps his shoulders and winces. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS769
01:16:14,00 --> 01:16:22,50
With wide eyes, SOMEONE nods. As the old man leans on a rack, SOMEONE scans the room. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS770
01:16:20,00 --> 01:16:24,50
He eyes SOMEONE skeptically. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS771
01:16:26,00 --> 01:16:30,50
SOMEONE steps forward. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS772
01:16:38,00 --> 01:16:42,50
SOMEONE's gaze tenses. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS773
01:16:39,00 --> 01:16:43,50
He studies an armored case. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS774
01:16:51,00 --> 01:16:57,50
SOMEONE slowly follows SOMEONE, who eyes the pistol beside SOMEONE's body. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS775
01:17:02,00 --> 01:17:08,50
Slowly turning, SOMEONE shares a tense look with his dad. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS776
01:17:05,00 --> 01:17:09,50
SOMEONE aims toward SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS778
01:17:11,00 --> 01:17:15,50
SOMEONE pins him. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS779
01:17:33,00 --> 01:17:41,50
SOMEONE shifts his gaze between them. Looking away, SOMEONE spots the pistol beside SOMEONE's dead body. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS780
01:17:59,00 --> 01:18:04,50
SOMEONE smirks at SOMEONE as SOMEONE shakes his head. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS781
01:18:04,00 --> 01:18:12,50
He looks down from SOMEONE's piercing glare. As SOMEONE pins him by the neck, SOMEONE reaches into his coat. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS783
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:17,50
A sinister grin spreads on SOMEONE's face. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS784
01:18:27,00 --> 01:18:31,50
SOMEONE listens on the radio. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS785
01:18:30,00 --> 01:18:34,50
He faces SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS786
01:18:33,00 --> 01:18:39,50
SOMEONE raises his brow as SOMEONE seethes. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS787
01:19:17,00 --> 01:19:23,50
SOMEONE head-butts SOMEONE, then quickly pulls him back in. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS788
01:19:20,00 --> 01:19:25,50
He shoves the old man toward the entrance 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS789
01:19:24,00 --> 01:19:31,50
Outside, SOMEONE yanks the bald thug’s weapon away and runs toward the building. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS790
01:19:34,00 --> 01:19:41,50
SOMEONE forces SOMEONE forward at gunpoint, as they proceed on the illuminated path from the vault. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS791
01:19:41,00 --> 01:19:47,50
Stepping through the rounded vault entrance, SOMEONE readies his weapon. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS792
01:19:44,00 --> 01:19:49,50
His eyes scan the large cluttered room. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS793
01:19:47,00 --> 01:19:51,50
SOMEONE emerges. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS794
01:19:52,00 --> 01:19:58,50
They take cover as the bald thug pops out. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS795
01:19:56,00 --> 01:20:03,50
The gunfire pins them down and SOMEONE scampers across the room. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS797
01:20:03,00 --> 01:20:14,50
SOMEONE quickly fires, then retracts behind a cement pillar. As the bald shirtless thug fires wildly, bullets pierce the hoses, spraying chemicals into the air. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS798
01:20:11,00 --> 01:20:15,50
SOMEONE returns fire. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS799
01:20:13,00 --> 01:20:21,50
Fleeing, SOMEONE rushes up a stairwell. SOMEONE shoots quick bursts around the pillar and his father joins in. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS800
01:20:19,00 --> 01:20:27,50
A glass panel shatters beside SOMEONE. Emptying his clip, SOMEONE tosses his rifle aside. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS801
01:20:24,00 --> 01:20:28,50
SOMEONE uses the radio.

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS805
01:20:35,00 --> 01:20:41,50
Outside, SOMEONE hurries up the helicopter's loading ramp. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS806
01:20:38,00 --> 01:20:44,50
Glancing back, she enters past the truck. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS807
01:20:41,00 --> 01:20:47,50
Inside, the hoses continue releasing gas. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS808
01:20:44,00 --> 01:20:50,50
As the bald thug fires, SOMEONE tosses a grenade to his dad. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS809
01:20:47,00 --> 01:20:53,50
Peeking out, SOMEONE notices the small forklift. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS810
01:20:50,00 --> 01:20:55,50
SOMEONE sits in the chopper's cockpit. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS814
01:20:57,00 --> 01:21:04,50
Bullets ricochet off the forklift, as it creeps toward the bald thug. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS815
01:21:01,00 --> 01:21:11,50
SOMEONE returns fire from behind the pillar. The forklift comes to rest beside the thug, and he notices the grenade. SOMEONE covers his head. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS816
01:21:13,00 --> 01:21:19,50
A massive explosion rips through the room. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS817
01:21:16,00 --> 01:21:24,50
Blue and orange flame swirl from the blast point, wrapping around the pillar as SOMEONE cowers behind. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS818
01:21:26,00 --> 01:21:34,50
The flames settle throughout the incinerated room. Outside, the chopper's rotors spin. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS819
01:21:39,00 --> 01:21:46,50
SOMEONE quickly stands. Bursting through a door, SOMEONE staggers on to the roof. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS820
01:21:43,00 --> 01:21:52,50
He grabs a weapon beside one of his dead men. SOMEONE rips off his jacket and pulls a pistol from his waistband. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS821
01:21:49,00 --> 01:22:09,50
He runs through the flaming room in his dirty and bloodstained white T-shirt. SOMEONE sprints up the stairs as his father exits the building. SOMEONE sees the helicopter still on the ground. Shielding his face, he rushes toward the loading ramp as the rotor intensifies. In the cockpit, the pilot readies for liftoff. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS822
01:22:09,00 --> 01:22:17,50
Leaping up, SOMEONE grabs on to the open ramp door as the chopper slowly lifts off. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS823
01:22:14,00 --> 01:22:20,50
The aging detective struggles to pull himself up. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS824
01:22:17,00 --> 01:22:23,50
Thick dust swirls beneath the rising helicopter. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS825
01:22:20,00 --> 01:22:27,50
SOMEONE continues sprinting up the stairs, as SOMEONE climbs into the cargo hold. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS826
01:22:25,00 --> 01:22:30,50
He crawls forward with a pistol in his hand. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS829
01:22:39,00 --> 01:22:45,50
As SOMEONE army-crawls beneath the truck, a thug enters by the front end. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS830
01:22:42,00 --> 01:22:47,50
SOMEONE aims at his legs. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS832
01:22:47,00 --> 01:22:52,50
The thug collapses and SOMEONE finishes him off. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS833
01:22:49,00 --> 01:22:56,50
Inside, SOMEONE reaches the top and hurries on to the roof, with his pistol aimed. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS834
01:22:54,00 --> 01:22:58,50
SOMEONE fires on him. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS836
01:22:58,00 --> 01:23:06,50
As SOMEONE returns fire, a bullet strikes his vest, knocking him down. SOMEONE blindly fires. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS838
01:23:06,00 --> 01:23:21,50
There is a small arms fire coming from the roof. The chopper hovers toward the roof. Through a small window, SOMEONE peers into the cockpit at SOMEONE and the pilot. He grabs the steel handle and tugs. Stepping back, SOMEONE aims at the door. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS845
01:23:40,00 --> 01:23:44,50
The chopper turns to face the roof. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS846
01:23:42,00 --> 01:23:48,50
Looking out a side door, SOMEONE sees the guns engaging.

01:23:46,00 --> 01:23:52,50
SOMEONE fires his pistol in the air. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS850
01:23:53,00 --> 01:24:00,50
The heavy caliber bullets rip into the building, following the helicopter's searchlights.

01:24:00,00 --> 01:24:06,50
SOMEONE secures a chain to the truck and tops inside. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS853
01:24:05,00 --> 01:24:10,50
SOMEONE clenches her jaw and fires. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS854
01:24:07,00 --> 01:24:14,50
As bullets strike the roof, the searchlights wash over SOMEONE. He shuts his eyes. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS855
01:24:17,00 --> 01:24:24,50
SOMEONE drives the truck out of the cargo hold, tilting the chopper's nose upward. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS857
01:24:23,00 --> 01:24:27,50
The chain tightens and jolts the truck. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS858
01:24:25,00 --> 01:24:32,50
Opening his eyes, SOMEONE sees the chopper shooting upward and losing control. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS861
01:24:35,00 --> 01:24:41,50
SOMEONE sees the truck hanging out and hurls the radio aside. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS862
01:24:38,00 --> 01:24:45,50
Spinning wildly, the chopper's tail rotor chops through the block letter sign. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS865
01:24:46,00 --> 01:24:50,50
SOMEONE hops to his feet. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS866
01:24:47,00 --> 01:24:57,50
In slow motion, he runs across a series of docks spanning the roof as sparks fly from the rotor blades hitting the sign. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS867
01:24:54,00 --> 01:24:59,50
SOMEONE zips through the dust-filled air. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS868
01:24:56,00 --> 01:25:03,50
With glaring eyes, SOMEONE dives toward SOMEONE who tries to aim at him.

01:25:02,00 --> 01:25:07,50
He knocks SOMEONE down and quickly stands. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS872
01:25:08,00 --> 01:25:12,50
SOMEONE drags SOMEONE to the edge. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS873
01:25:12,00 --> 01:25:19,50
The truck smashes into the building and the door shoots open, SOMEONE barely hangs on. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS874
01:25:19,00 --> 01:25:25,50
A plunging case nearly strikes SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS875
01:25:29,00 --> 01:25:33,50
He hurls SOMEONE off the roof. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS876
01:25:30,00 --> 01:25:37,50
In slow motion, he plummets - face up, his eyes wide. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS877
01:25:34,00 --> 01:25:40,50
SOMEONE glares as the chopper's tail rotor obliterates SOMEONE. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS878
01:25:40,00 --> 01:25:46,50
SOMEONE hangs from the truck's bumper, as the chopper spins.

01:25:45,00 --> 01:25:50,50
SOMEONE runs along the roof's edge. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS880
01:25:50,00 --> 01:26:00,50
The spinning chopper nears the roof. Kicking his legs, SOMEONE keeps hold of the bumper. SOMEONE continues to the opposite side. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS881
01:25:57,00 --> 01:26:02,50
As the truck swings wide, SOMEONE lets go. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS882
01:26:00,00 --> 01:26:06,50
Flailing, he flies towards an enormous window in slow motion. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS884
01:26:09,00 --> 01:26:15,50
SOMEONE lands hard, rolling in shattered glass on the floor. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS885
01:26:12,00 --> 01:26:18,50
The truck swings into the building's side and breaks off from the chopper. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS886
01:26:16,00 --> 01:26:21,50
Falling to the ground, it explodes on impact. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS889
01:26:21,00 --> 01:26:30,50
Regaining control, SOMEONE loops the chopper around. Inside, SOMEONE kicks open a door to the flaming room. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS890
01:26:29,00 --> 01:26:34,50
He shields his face from the smoke. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS891
01:26:31,00 --> 01:26:36,50
Outside, the helicopter nears the building. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS892
01:26:34,00 --> 01:26:40,50
SOMEONE helps SOMEONE to his feet, as burning SOMEONE rains down around them. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS893
01:26:37,00 --> 01:26:45,50
Positioning the chopper in front of the room, SOMEONE narrows her eyes and grips the weapon trigger. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS899
01:26:52,00 --> 01:26:57,50
SOMEONE flies at the building. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS900
01:26:55,00 --> 01:27:07,50
This is for you, Papa. SOMEONE sees the helicopter rapidly approaching. In slow motion, he and SOMEONE leap out of the shattered window as the chopper's nose collides with the building. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS902
01:27:09,00 --> 01:27:14,50
SOMEONE watches them fall with glaring eyes. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS903
01:27:11,00 --> 01:27:17,50
Below her, the flaming truck swells on the ground. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS905
01:27:16,00 --> 01:27:28,50
In extreme slow motion, the flailing men plummet beside the aircraft. The chopper's nose drags along the building, sending a barrage of SOMEONE into the air. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS906
01:27:25,00 --> 01:27:30,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE crash through a glass roof. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS907
01:27:28,00 --> 01:27:35,50
They plunge into the leak-filled pool as the helicopter lands on the flaming truck. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS908
01:27:34,00 --> 01:27:42,50
As the chopper explodes, flames erupt through the glass wall and over the pool. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS909
01:27:40,00 --> 01:27:48,50
The rapidly expanding blast launches propeller blades and metallic SOMEONE across the wide clearing. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS911
01:27:50,00 --> 01:27:55,50
As the swirl of flames retracts, 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS912
01:27:52,00 --> 01:27:58,50
a giant cloud of black smoke rises from the blazing remains. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS913
01:27:59,00 --> 01:28:03,50
SOMEONE surfaces. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS914
01:28:00,00 --> 01:28:06,50
Underwater, we view his slowly paddling legs. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS915
01:28:04,00 --> 01:28:09,50
He dives beneath the surface. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS916
01:28:08,00 --> 01:28:16,50
Large flecks of ash reign down, as dancing flames dock the room. SOMEONE surfaces again. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS917
01:28:27,00 --> 01:28:34,50
SOMEONE leans his head back in a relieved sigh, then swims to the pool's edge. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS918
01:28:31,00 --> 01:28:38,50
Sitting up, SOMEONE rests his back against the basin's elevated rim. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS919
01:28:35,00 --> 01:28:41,50
Grabbing SOMEONE's shirt, he helps him out of the water. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS920
01:28:39,00 --> 01:28:46,50
Settling next to his father, SOMEONE gulps down breaths of air and winces painfully. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS921
01:28:44,00 --> 01:28:50,50
Coin-sized flecks of ash reign down on their wet clinging T-shirts. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS922
01:28:48,00 --> 01:28:52,50
SOMEONE shifts his weight and grimaces. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS923
01:29:06,00 --> 01:29:11,50
The two men work their way to their feet. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS924
01:29:09,00 --> 01:29:17,50
Now as the building burns in the darkness, the father and son shuffle out among the wreckage. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS925
01:30:12,00 --> 01:30:18,50
SOMEONE yields a smile as he limps alongside his father. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS926
01:30:16,00 --> 01:30:25,50
From the burning structure, black smoke plumes into a sky cast rose and indigo by the light of a low sun. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS927
01:30:22,00 --> 01:30:29,50
Now a bright early morning sun halos the cockpit of a sleek private jet. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS928
01:30:27,00 --> 01:30:33,50
On the tarmac, government agents stand ready with assault rifles. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS929
01:30:31,00 --> 01:30:37,50
They're vehicles sit parked nearby, emergency lights flashing. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS930
01:30:35,00 --> 01:30:41,50
Before them, SOMEONE stands anxiously with her arms folded. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS931
01:30:38,00 --> 01:30:43,50
An agent touches his earpiece, then signals to his colleague. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS932
01:30:40,00 --> 01:30:44,50
The private jet's passenger door opens and the stairs fold out. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS933
01:30:42,00 --> 01:30:49,50
SOMEONE wrings her hands and cranes her neck. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS935
01:30:49,00 --> 01:30:56,50
Emerging, SOMEONE descends the steps with a stilted limp and his father at his heels. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS936
01:30:54,00 --> 01:31:00,50
Facing his sister, the young agent gives a broad smile. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS937
01:30:58,00 --> 01:31:04,50
Hurrying toward her family, SOMEONE breaks into a run. Her long auburn hair sways across her back with each stride. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS938
01:31:02,00 --> 01:31:08,50
Reaching her brother, she flings her arms around him in a welcoming embrace. SOMEONE grins and hugs her back, while SOMEONE looks on with a fond, tender smile. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS940
01:31:10,00 --> 01:31:17,50
The father and daughter beam softly at one another. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS941
01:31:15,00 --> 01:31:20,50
In slow motion, SOMEONE signals forward with his hand,  

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS942
01:31:19,00 --> 01:31:28,50
then sets off across the tarmac with SOMEONE at his side. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS943
01:31:25,00 --> 01:31:31,50
SOMEONE walks on the other side of her brother. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS944
01:31:30,00 --> 01:31:37,50
In the sun's golden glow, the father, son and daughter converse animated. 

A_GOOD_DAY_TO_DIE_HARD_DVS945
01:31:40,00 --> 01:31:46,50
As SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE McClane smile, the sunlight flares around their figure. The image freezes.
