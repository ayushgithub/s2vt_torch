BURLESQUE_DVS26
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:50,50
Later as the blonde packs a suitcase, the sexy dancers pump their hips. 

BURLESQUE_DVS27
00:02:47,00 --> 00:02:52,50
The blonde regards a framed photo of a woman. 

BURLESQUE_DVS28
00:02:53,00 --> 00:02:57,50
She sings in the empty dive. 

BURLESQUE_DVS29
00:02:56,00 --> 00:03:01,50
She leaves the trailer park behind. 

BURLESQUE_DVS32
00:03:14,00 --> 00:03:20,50
At a bus station. 

BURLESQUE_DVS33
00:03:27,00 --> 00:03:33,50
Now she peers dreamily out the window of a cruising bus. 

BURLESQUE_DVS34
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:42,50
As the sequined-clad dancers command their stage, the blonde sings to empty chairs in SOMEONE's bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS35
00:03:48,00 --> 00:03:58,50
Now the Hollywood sign fills the screen. On the bus, the sleepy blonde opens her eyes just as the sign's reflection skates across her window. 

BURLESQUE_DVS36
00:03:55,00 --> 00:04:08,50
Later in a run-down room at the old redbrick Hotel Rosslyn, she opens her suitcase. Other views show the glitzy athletic dancers in unison, then the blonde rocking out in SOMEONE's empty bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS37
00:04:06,00 --> 00:04:12,50
Now the blonde seals her stash of money inside a plastic bag. 

BURLESQUE_DVS38
00:04:09,00 --> 00:04:19,50
In the bathroom, she lifts the lid off the toilet tank and carefully sets the bag inside, leaving its top edge over the back rim. 

BURLESQUE_DVS39
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:21,50
She replaces the porcelain lid. 

BURLESQUE_DVS40
00:04:18,00 --> 00:04:23,50
Now she unpacks her framed photo. 

BURLESQUE_DVS41
00:04:32,00 --> 00:04:39,50
The blonde gazes fondly at the photo, which shows the brunette woman cradling a young girl. 

BURLESQUE_DVS42
00:04:37,00 --> 00:04:43,50
Now the newcomer to LA sits at a desk with a postcard of the old hotel. 

BURLESQUE_DVS43
00:04:41,00 --> 00:04:45,50
She counts up several windows, 

BURLESQUE_DVS44
00:04:42,00 --> 00:04:47,50
She marks one specifically, and labels it. 

BURLESQUE_DVS46
00:04:45,00 --> 00:04:50,50
She flips the postcard. Her pen tip hovers. 

BURLESQUE_DVS47
00:04:48,00 --> 00:04:52,50
Then she rips the card to shreds. 

BURLESQUE_DVS48
00:04:50,00 --> 00:04:56,50
At her open window, she tosses the scraps and watches them flutter downward. 

BURLESQUE_DVS49
00:04:58,00 --> 00:05:03,50
Now she steps onto a busy sidewalk. 

BURLESQUE_DVS50
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:08,50
She lifts her gaze from an issue of Back Stage Magazine in her hand and finds a sign for Hollywood Boulevard. 

BURLESQUE_DVS51
00:05:06,00 --> 00:05:13,50
Her finger trails down an ad in the magazine that seeks background singers for urban group. 

BURLESQUE_DVS52
00:05:11,00 --> 00:05:17,50
At a street corner, a set of signs marks Hollywood and Vine. 

BURLESQUE_DVS53
00:05:14,00 --> 00:05:20,50
Our view sweeps up the towering circular Capitol Records building. 

BURLESQUE_DVS54
00:05:18,00 --> 00:05:25,50
The blonde enters another building, then exits and crosses off the ad in her paper. 

BURLESQUE_DVS55
00:05:22,00 --> 00:05:30,50
Later still, she Xs out two more ads for singers and dancers as she continues down the boulevard. 

BURLESQUE_DVS56
00:05:28,00 --> 00:05:34,50
She gives someone a polite smile, which instantly fades as she moves on. 

BURLESQUE_DVS57
00:05:32,00 --> 00:05:37,50
Golden sunlight dwindles on the LA skyline. 

BURLESQUE_DVS58
00:05:35,00 --> 00:05:39,50
Fade to black. 

BURLESQUE_DVS59
00:05:41,00 --> 00:05:46,50
In the evening, the blonde strolls a busy street. 

BURLESQUE_DVS60
00:05:43,00 --> 00:05:48,50
Her eyes sweeping her surroundings, 

BURLESQUE_DVS61
00:05:45,00 --> 00:05:50,50
she stops at an eye-catching archway. 

BURLESQUE_DVS62
00:05:48,00 --> 00:05:53,50
Flashing light bulbs arc over a gleaming sign, 

BURLESQUE_DVS63
00:05:50,00 --> 00:05:54,50
Burlesque Lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS64
00:05:52,00 --> 00:06:00,50
On the building's fire escape, she sees a woman in a sexy corset with a short feathery skirt. 

BURLESQUE_DVS65
00:05:57,00 --> 00:06:05,50
As the woman adjusts her striped thigh-highs, her gaze meets the blonde's. They share a smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS66
00:06:02,00 --> 00:06:08,50
A bald man with a cigarette between his lips emerges from the building. 

BURLESQUE_DVS67
00:06:11,00 --> 00:06:16,50
The blonde heads toward the burlesque lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS68
00:06:13,00 --> 00:06:21,50
Our view sweeps up a nearly completed high-rise behind her that advertises, Luxury Condos for Sale. 

BURLESQUE_DVS69
00:06:19,00 --> 00:06:24,50
The blonde checks out a poster outside the lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS70
00:06:22,00 --> 00:06:29,50
It shows a pixie-faced blue-eyed brunette and reads, The Best View on the Sunset Strip. 

BURLESQUE_DVS73
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:38,50
Entering the building, the blonde makes her way down a dim wood-paneled hall. 

BURLESQUE_DVS74
00:06:36,00 --> 00:06:42,50
As she heads down a staircase, she eyes the lounge's stage through a window. 

BURLESQUE_DVS75
00:06:46,00 --> 00:06:55,50
Onstage, cool-blue light bathes dancers in skimpy sailor-themed outfits as they strike provocative poses. 

BURLESQUE_DVS76
00:06:58,00 --> 00:07:03,50
A doorman holds out his hand. 

BURLESQUE_DVS77
00:07:12,00 --> 00:07:21,50
Onstage, six captivating dancers - three on a platform, three in front - scoop their hips and twirl their hands. They point skyward. 

BURLESQUE_DVS78
00:07:25,00 --> 00:07:33,50
The blonde opens her wallet and hesitates. She casts another glance at the show, then hands over a $20. 

BURLESQUE_DVS79
00:07:34,00 --> 00:07:40,50
Onstage, the reclined dancers snap then raise their arms in the air. 

BURLESQUE_DVS81
00:07:38,00 --> 00:07:44,50
Behind them, a woman with dark curly hair and high cheek bones faces us. 

BURLESQUE_DVS82
00:07:42,00 --> 00:07:46,50
She wears a low-cut black unitard with tails and fuchsia lapels. 

BURLESQUE_DVS84
00:08:13,00 --> 00:08:18,50
The dancers rise and strut around the singer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS85
00:08:28,00 --> 00:08:37,50
The dancers tap their heels, then nod to a neighboring stage where musicians play. One-by-one the dancers face the audience. 

BURLESQUE_DVS86
00:08:37,00 --> 00:08:41,50
They pump their chests. 

BURLESQUE_DVS87
00:08:44,00 --> 00:08:51,50
The mesmerized blonde watches as varying dancers respond to their names. 

BURLESQUE_DVS88
00:09:13,00 --> 00:09:22,50
An auburn-haired dancer waves coyly. Now all of the dancers curl their fingers at us, beckoning mischievously. 

BURLESQUE_DVS89
00:09:48,00 --> 00:09:51,50
The dancers squat. 

BURLESQUE_DVS90
00:09:52,00 --> 00:10:01,50
The dancers strike alluring seductive poses and line up downstage. One lifts a leg higher than the singer's head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS91
00:10:09,00 --> 00:10:14,50
The posed dancers frame the smiling diva. 

BURLESQUE_DVS92
00:10:12,00 --> 00:10:17,50
Tears in her eyes, the blonde woman claps, transfixed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS93
00:10:15,00 --> 00:10:25,50
As the band plays, a spotlight shines on dancers in silver-sequined outfits. A handsome toned bartender in eyeliner and a bowler hat leans toward the blonde. 

BURLESQUE_DVS94
00:10:36,00 --> 00:10:44,50
They swap a smile. Then she returns her eyes to the stage where the dancers shake their hips. 

BURLESQUE_DVS95
00:10:41,00 --> 00:10:47,50
The bartender interrupts a pink-haired waitress who's busy flirting. 

BURLESQUE_DVS96
00:10:49,00 --> 00:10:54,50
The blonde turns back to the bartender. 

BURLESQUE_DVS97
00:10:54,00 --> 00:10:59,50
She points to the stage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS98
00:11:10,00 --> 00:11:15,50
He hands her a business card. 

BURLESQUE_DVS99
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:20,50
As she leaves, the bartender smiles. Now the blonde enters a bustling backstage area. 

BURLESQUE_DVS100
00:11:18,00 --> 00:11:27,50
A dancer bumps into her as she hurries past. The blonde sees another dancer pulling on a sparkling garter over black stockings. 

BURLESQUE_DVS101
00:11:27,00 --> 00:11:37,50
Two dancers wear light-satin corsets with black spirals at the breasts. The blonde visitor finds the bald stage manager conferring with the diva. 

BURLESQUE_DVS102
00:12:06,00 --> 00:12:10,50
The naysayer faces the singer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS103
00:12:37,00 --> 00:12:42,50
As SOMEONE does the dancer's hair, the blonde approaches. 

BURLESQUE_DVS104
00:12:41,00 --> 00:12:47,50
She finds SOMEONE applying makeup at a mirror and leans over her shoulder. 

BURLESQUE_DVS105
00:13:29,00 --> 00:13:34,50
The eager woman slouches sadly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS106
00:13:32,00 --> 00:13:38,50
On her way out, she collides with the brunette in large sunglasses. 

BURLESQUE_DVS107
00:13:55,00 --> 00:13:59,50
She shows her nails. 

BURLESQUE_DVS108
00:14:11,00 --> 00:14:18,50
As the pixie-faced dancer brushes on blush, the blonde tilts her head at her. SOMEONE glances over. 

BURLESQUE_DVS109
00:14:31,00 --> 00:14:36,50
As she leaves, Jesse reaches for SOMEONE's makeup. 

BURLESQUE_DVS110
00:14:39,00 --> 00:14:48,50
Now, the young hopeful from Iowa sees the pink-haired waitress snubbing a customer. So she doffs her brown-leather jacket and grabs an empty tray from the bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS111
00:14:46,00 --> 00:14:54,50
She walks out among the tables. Collecting empty glasses, the ambitious girl starts taking drink orders. 

BURLESQUE_DVS112
00:14:59,00 --> 00:15:04,50
As she brings the tray back to the bar, SOMEONE notices her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS113
00:15:13,00 --> 00:15:24,50
The image revolves, framed in light bulbs like a dressing-room mirror. Now in black hot pants, the young hopeful collects a spent glass and draws a smile from SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS114
00:15:21,00 --> 00:15:30,50
Onstage, SOMEONE slides down beaded strands forming a curtain. In a black bra and panties, she lands in a split. 

BURLESQUE_DVS115
00:15:39,00 --> 00:15:45,50
As the girl from Iowa serves drinks, SOMEONE notices her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS116
00:16:08,00 --> 00:16:12,50
She gestures for the young woman to come over. 

BURLESQUE_DVS117
00:16:27,00 --> 00:16:32,50
SOMEONE sits back down beside SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS118
00:16:36,00 --> 00:16:40,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE swap smiles. 

BURLESQUE_DVS119
00:16:38,00 --> 00:16:44,50
SOMEONE windmills a leg, then seizes a bracelet off of Jesse. 

BURLESQUE_DVS120
00:16:43,00 --> 00:16:49,50
SOMEONE mimics a dance step, then resumes her work. 

BURLESQUE_DVS121
00:16:46,00 --> 00:16:51,50
SOMEONE leads four dancers downstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS122
00:16:54,00 --> 00:16:59,50
Now a rugged man gets SOMEONE's attention. 

BURLESQUE_DVS123
00:17:06,00 --> 00:17:10,50
He slides her his AmEx. 

BURLESQUE_DVS124
00:17:12,00 --> 00:17:16,50
She looks back. 

BURLESQUE_DVS126
00:17:17,00 --> 00:17:21,50
SOMEONE smirks. 

BURLESQUE_DVS127
00:17:19,00 --> 00:17:27,50
SOMEONE pushes the beads aside. She sees SOMEONE performing, then SOMEONE waiting tables. 

BURLESQUE_DVS128
00:17:35,00 --> 00:17:39,50
She dons a white stole. 

BURLESQUE_DVS129
00:17:39,00 --> 00:17:44,50
The curtain parts and SOMEONE struts into the limelight. 

BURLESQUE_DVS130
00:17:44,00 --> 00:17:51,50
She passes her stole to SOMEONE, who pitches it and competitively joins SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS131
00:17:48,00 --> 00:17:55,50
They swipe kitty paws at each other, then take turns upstaging each other. 

BURLESQUE_DVS132
00:17:52,00 --> 00:17:59,50
Entranced, SOMEONE flourishes a hand in front of a customer's face. 

BURLESQUE_DVS133
00:17:56,00 --> 00:18:04,50
Now the dancers drum their hips. SOMEONE taps SOMEONE's nose. Then they trade phrases. 

BURLESQUE_DVS134
00:18:18,00 --> 00:18:25,50
At the bar, SOMEONE imagines herself performing, showered by silver confetti. 

BURLESQUE_DVS135
00:18:36,00 --> 00:18:41,50
She flings away her serving tray. 

BURLESQUE_DVS136
00:18:43,00 --> 00:18:48,50
She twirls a string of diamonds overhead. 

BURLESQUE_DVS137
00:18:50,00 --> 00:19:02,50
Standing on a fringed pedestal surrounded by dancers, she coils the strand around her wrist. Snapping to, she gazes longingly at the performance. SOMEONE shoves SOMEONE offstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS138
00:19:01,00 --> 00:19:05,50
She opens her arms to the crowd. 

BURLESQUE_DVS139
00:19:06,00 --> 00:19:09,50
SOMEONE taps her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS140
00:19:19,00 --> 00:19:28,50
While SOMEONE chats at Marcus' table, SOMEONE peers over his glasses. SOMEONE glances at the stage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS141
00:19:36,00 --> 00:19:44,50
He slides her a tray of drinks. Now a stack of burlesque-related books lands on her hotel bed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS142
00:19:41,00 --> 00:19:50,50
SOMEONE lies on her stomach, flipping through photos of famed performers. At the lounge, she studies the dancers. 

BURLESQUE_DVS143
00:19:47,00 --> 00:19:53,50
Lying on her back, she rests another book on her chest. 

BURLESQUE_DVS144
00:19:50,00 --> 00:19:56,50
We glimpse the Burlesque Lounge sign. Then SOMEONE and SOMEONE at work. 

BURLESQUE_DVS145
00:19:54,00 --> 00:20:00,50
As she serves a drink, the bartender eyes her and rubs his unshaven cheek. 

BURLESQUE_DVS146
00:19:58,00 --> 00:20:03,50
Now a soundman preps a vocal CD. 

BURLESQUE_DVS147
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:06,50
Sitting on the edge of the stage, SOMEONE crosses her legs. 

BURLESQUE_DVS148
00:20:15,00 --> 00:20:20,50
SOMEONE looks on with a tray of empty glasses. 

BURLESQUE_DVS149
00:20:43,00 --> 00:20:49,50
An overhead light shines down on three sexy nurses at an exam chair. 

BURLESQUE_DVS150
00:20:47,00 --> 00:20:53,50
In a lace bodysuit, SOMEONE stands and rocks her hips. 

BURLESQUE_DVS151
00:20:51,00 --> 00:20:56,50
Now in SOMEONE' office. 

BURLESQUE_DVS152
00:21:00,00 --> 00:21:04,50
SOMEONE looks on. 

BURLESQUE_DVS153
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:06,50
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a document. 

BURLESQUE_DVS154
00:21:32,00 --> 00:21:36,50
He grins. 

BURLESQUE_DVS155
00:22:08,00 --> 00:22:14,50
SOMEONE paces to a framed photo of her burlesque troupe. 

BURLESQUE_DVS156
00:22:11,00 --> 00:22:16,50
The picture reflects her porcelain complexion. 

BURLESQUE_DVS157
00:22:13,00 --> 00:22:18,50
As SOMEONE waits, she regards him plainly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS158
00:22:28,00 --> 00:22:32,50
In the hall, SOMEONE overhears. 

BURLESQUE_DVS159
00:22:39,00 --> 00:22:44,50
SOMEONE leaves. SOMEONE turns on his way out. 

BURLESQUE_DVS160
00:22:46,00 --> 00:22:51,50
Onstage, the nurses roll SOMEONE along in the chair. 

BURLESQUE_DVS161
00:22:54,00 --> 00:22:58,50
She rises to her knees. 

BURLESQUE_DVS162
00:22:57,00 --> 00:23:01,50
A nurse eyes the crowd. 

BURLESQUE_DVS163
00:23:12,00 --> 00:23:21,50
SOMEONE watches her and SOMEONE looks up from pouring a drink. With a dramatic swoon, SOMEONE wipes her brow and lies back. 

BURLESQUE_DVS164
00:23:18,00 --> 00:23:25,50
Later a bartender pours two tequila shots. In the dressing room, the dancers fix their makeup. 

BURLESQUE_DVS165
00:23:27,00 --> 00:23:31,50
SOMEONE sets down her tray. 

BURLESQUE_DVS166
00:23:35,00 --> 00:23:39,50
SOMEONE picks up the shot glasses. 

BURLESQUE_DVS167
00:23:42,00 --> 00:23:47,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch her down both shots. 

BURLESQUE_DVS168
00:23:54,00 --> 00:23:59,50
SOMEONE joins SOMEONE at a costume rack. 

BURLESQUE_DVS170
00:24:55,00 --> 00:24:59,50
SOMEONE glances back. 

BURLESQUE_DVS171
00:24:59,00 --> 00:25:03,50
SOMEONE peers through the rack. 

BURLESQUE_DVS172
00:25:07,00 --> 00:25:11,50
He wraps his legs around her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS173
00:25:09,00 --> 00:25:13,50
Now at the Hotel Rosslyn, 

BURLESQUE_DVS174
00:25:10,00 --> 00:25:20,50
SOMEONE finds her door broken in. She enters her ransacked studio apartment, then drops her purse and hurries into the bathroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS175
00:25:17,00 --> 00:25:22,50
She finds the empty sandwich baggie on the floor. 

BURLESQUE_DVS176
00:25:23,00 --> 00:25:31,50
On the bed, SOMEONE finds her photograph under broken glass, halfway out of its now-bent frame. 

BURLESQUE_DVS177
00:25:28,00 --> 00:25:33,50
She holds the photo of the mother and child. 

BURLESQUE_DVS178
00:25:30,00 --> 00:25:37,50
SOMEONE glances around, then sits on the edge of the bed and covers her mouth. 

BURLESQUE_DVS179
00:25:37,00 --> 00:25:43,50
Now SOMEONE rides down a street on a motorcycle and parks. 

BURLESQUE_DVS180
00:25:44,00 --> 00:25:50,50
She sits on the stoop of a picturesque Spanish-style apartment building. 

BURLESQUE_DVS181
00:25:47,00 --> 00:25:52,50
Later he lets her in. 

BURLESQUE_DVS182
00:26:38,00 --> 00:26:44,50
He takes back his phone and they sip their drinks. 

BURLESQUE_DVS183
00:26:55,00 --> 00:26:58,50
Later, SOMEONE 

BURLESQUE_DVS184
00:26:56,00 --> 00:27:00,50
reclines on a daybed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS185
00:26:57,00 --> 00:27:01,50
SOMEONE sits at a synthesizer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS186
00:27:59,00 --> 00:28:04,50
She nestles in and pulls her blanket close. 

BURLESQUE_DVS188
00:28:02,00 --> 00:28:07,50
Rain pounds the street outside. 

BURLESQUE_DVS189
00:28:04,00 --> 00:28:08,50
SOMEONE wakes, 

BURLESQUE_DVS190
00:28:05,00 --> 00:28:12,50
then opens his bedroom's French doors and steps out in jeans and a white tank. 

BURLESQUE_DVS191
00:28:14,00 --> 00:28:19,50
SOMEONE ogles SOMEONE's short pajama top. 

BURLESQUE_DVS192
00:28:54,00 --> 00:28:59,50
As she hops into some jeans, she tips over. 

BURLESQUE_DVS193
00:29:08,00 --> 00:29:12,50
She collects her suitcase and bag. 

BURLESQUE_DVS194
00:29:16,00 --> 00:29:23,50
SOMEONE steps out of the apartment building and peers morosely at the rain-pelted street. 

BURLESQUE_DVS195
00:29:24,00 --> 00:29:29,50
She grabs a newspaper and holds it overhead. 

BURLESQUE_DVS196
00:29:31,00 --> 00:29:37,50
SOMEONE peers out of his window and watches her walk out to the curb. 

BURLESQUE_DVS197
00:29:36,00 --> 00:29:43,50
SOMEONE watches a car pass by. Then SOMEONE leaves the window. 

BURLESQUE_DVS198
00:29:40,00 --> 00:29:45,50
As SOMEONE waits in the downpour at a bus stop, 

BURLESQUE_DVS199
00:29:42,00 --> 00:29:47,50
SOMEONE steps out, barefoot. 

BURLESQUE_DVS200
00:30:02,00 --> 00:30:06,50
He picks her up. 

BURLESQUE_DVS201
00:30:04,00 --> 00:30:08,50
Now inside. 

BURLESQUE_DVS202
00:30:18,00 --> 00:30:22,50
He pushes the door shut. 

BURLESQUE_DVS203
00:30:22,00 --> 00:30:29,50
Now at the club, an employee polishes mirrored panels behind the bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS204
00:30:26,00 --> 00:30:31,50
The cashier puts down chairs. 

BURLESQUE_DVS205
00:30:28,00 --> 00:30:34,50
As the band practices, a bartender wipes down a bottle. 

BURLESQUE_DVS206
00:30:31,00 --> 00:30:36,50
SOMEONE enters a bathroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS207
00:30:36,00 --> 00:30:41,50
She notes someone in a stall. 

BURLESQUE_DVS208
00:30:41,00 --> 00:30:46,50
The red-haired dancer steps out. 

BURLESQUE_DVS209
00:30:48,00 --> 00:30:52,50
SOMEONE shakes her head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS210
00:30:54,00 --> 00:30:58,50
The young woman leans on the sink. 

BURLESQUE_DVS211
00:31:24,00 --> 00:31:28,50
They hug. 

BURLESQUE_DVS212
00:31:39,00 --> 00:31:44,50
SOMEONE peers nervously skyward. 

BURLESQUE_DVS213
00:31:41,00 --> 00:31:47,50
Now beaming dancers in plain clothes leap through the air. 

BURLESQUE_DVS214
00:31:44,00 --> 00:31:50,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch from a table on the empty floor. 

BURLESQUE_DVS215
00:31:47,00 --> 00:31:53,50
SOMEONE enters the club and observes the girls onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS216
00:31:50,00 --> 00:31:56,50
As she doffs her jean jacket, she keeps watching. 

BURLESQUE_DVS217
00:31:59,00 --> 00:32:05,50
As the dancers leave, SOMEONE strides purposefully ahead. 

BURLESQUE_DVS218
00:32:18,00 --> 00:32:25,50
They notice SOMEONE onstage, swinging her hips and running her fingers down her blonde hair. 

BURLESQUE_DVS219
00:32:28,00 --> 00:32:33,50
SOMEONE peers back to the deejay booth. 

BURLESQUE_DVS220
00:32:44,00 --> 00:32:48,50
SOMEONE walks away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS221
00:32:48,00 --> 00:32:52,50
She wheels around. 

BURLESQUE_DVS222
00:33:20,00 --> 00:33:29,50
SOMEONE shoots a satisfied glance toward SOMEONE at the back of the house. SOMEONE returns to the table, where SOMEONE raises an eyebrow. 

BURLESQUE_DVS223
00:33:26,00 --> 00:33:31,50
SOMEONE and Coco enter and spot SOMEONE onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS224
00:33:29,00 --> 00:33:35,50
Standing at a chair with her back turned, SOMEONE lets her hair down. 

BURLESQUE_DVS225
00:33:32,00 --> 00:33:36,50
SOMEONE joins the girls. 

BURLESQUE_DVS226
00:33:36,00 --> 00:33:41,50
Our view rises up SOMEONE's slender body 

BURLESQUE_DVS227
00:33:41,00 --> 00:33:47,50
As SOMEONE enters with a box of liquor, he notices her too. 

BURLESQUE_DVS228
00:33:45,00 --> 00:33:51,50
SOMEONE gyrates her backside, then looks over her shoulder. 

BURLESQUE_DVS229
00:33:48,00 --> 00:33:54,50
Holding the back of the chair, she seductively points her knees in and out. 

BURLESQUE_DVS230
00:33:52,00 --> 00:33:57,50
She whips her hair back and steps forward. 

BURLESQUE_DVS231
00:33:55,00 --> 00:34:00,50
SOMEONE and the others keep watching. 

BURLESQUE_DVS232
00:33:57,00 --> 00:34:05,50
SOMEONE holds her hands out like paws, then slaps her backside with her right, then with her left, 

BURLESQUE_DVS233
00:34:02,00 --> 00:34:08,50
then twice more before resuming the wild dance. 

BURLESQUE_DVS234
00:34:05,00 --> 00:34:11,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE, who eyes her knowingly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS235
00:34:08,00 --> 00:34:13,50
The club owner affords a slight nod. 

BURLESQUE_DVS236
00:34:10,00 --> 00:34:17,50
Now SOMEONE rubs her hands over her head and body, then points her knees in. 

BURLESQUE_DVS237
00:34:14,00 --> 00:34:28,50
SOMEONE softly shakes his head to himself. As SOMEONE leans forward and pouts her full lips, SOMEONE's cool gaze hardens even more. Onstage, SOMEONE prances, paws out, and grins adorably. 

BURLESQUE_DVS238
00:34:25,00 --> 00:34:30,50
SOMEONE remains watchful. 

BURLESQUE_DVS239
00:34:27,00 --> 00:34:36,50
A smiling SOMEONE points her knees and pops out her hands, then swings her arms, shakes her hips, and whips her hair back. 

BURLESQUE_DVS240
00:34:34,00 --> 00:34:40,50
SOMEONE smiles. SOMEONE glares. SOMEONE folds his hands. 

BURLESQUE_DVS241
00:35:07,00 --> 00:35:12,50
SOMEONE beams. SOMEONE claps. 

BURLESQUE_DVS242
00:35:19,00 --> 00:35:23,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE leave. 

BURLESQUE_DVS243
00:35:21,00 --> 00:35:26,50
SOMEONE joins the excited young woman onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS244
00:35:33,00 --> 00:35:38,50
A delighted SOMEONE approaches, clapping. 

BURLESQUE_DVS245
00:35:50,00 --> 00:35:54,50
He nods. 

BURLESQUE_DVS246
00:35:51,00 --> 00:35:55,50
SOMEONE gives a silent scream. 

BURLESQUE_DVS247
00:35:54,00 --> 00:36:00,50
As she runs off, SOMEONE wears a muted smile. Now at the costume rack. 

BURLESQUE_DVS249
00:36:10,00 --> 00:36:14,50
A golden SOMEONE gun. 

BURLESQUE_DVS250
00:36:13,00 --> 00:36:18,50
It blasts him with gold confetti. 

BURLESQUE_DVS251
00:36:16,00 --> 00:36:21,50
He eyes her flatly and she forces a grin. 

BURLESQUE_DVS252
00:36:18,00 --> 00:36:24,50
Now SOMEONE struts confidently among pedestrians outside. 

BURLESQUE_DVS253
00:36:22,00 --> 00:36:27,50
At the club, she rehearses with the girls at the end of the line. 

BURLESQUE_DVS254
00:36:25,00 --> 00:36:30,50
Back with the pedestrians, she practices a move. 

BURLESQUE_DVS255
00:36:28,00 --> 00:36:37,50
In rehearsal, the dancers bounce, bop their heads, and gyrate their hips. On a sidewalk, SOMEONE practices the routine. 

BURLESQUE_DVS256
00:36:35,00 --> 00:36:42,50
The rehearsing dancers spin. Then SOMEONE spins on the street and resumes her walk. 

BURLESQUE_DVS257
00:36:39,00 --> 00:36:46,50
Onstage, a spotlight sweeps across the costumed girls. 

BURLESQUE_DVS258
00:36:43,00 --> 00:36:49,50
We cut from their routine to SOMEONE strolling down another street. 

BURLESQUE_DVS259
00:36:47,00 --> 00:36:52,50
She flourishes her wrist and gives a satisfied smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS260
00:36:50,00 --> 00:37:02,50
In a performance, the dancers frolic downstage, SOMEONE among them. The newest dancer runs her hands through her hair and shakes her hips. The view veers to SOMEONE backstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS261
00:36:59,00 --> 00:37:03,50
SOMEONE watches SOMEONE perform. 

BURLESQUE_DVS262
00:37:15,00 --> 00:37:19,50
The girls leave the stage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS263
00:37:33,00 --> 00:37:37,50
Later in the dressing room. 

BURLESQUE_DVS264
00:37:40,00 --> 00:37:46,50
As SOMEONE pulls on her sweater, the other dancers head out of the dressing room. 

BURLESQUE_DVS265
00:37:43,00 --> 00:37:48,50
She slings her bag over her shoulder, 

BURLESQUE_DVS266
00:37:45,00 --> 00:37:52,50
then turns and sees the group disappearing down a staircase without her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS267
00:37:49,00 --> 00:37:53,50
With a heavy look, 

BURLESQUE_DVS268
00:37:50,00 --> 00:37:57,50
SOMEONE drops her bag back on the floor and plops into her chair at the dressing table. 

BURLESQUE_DVS269
00:37:54,00 --> 00:38:01,50
Resting her chin on her fist, she gazes at a black-and-white photo stuck to her mirror. 

BURLESQUE_DVS270
00:37:59,00 --> 00:38:03,50
It shows a glamorous burlesque dancer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS271
00:38:01,00 --> 00:38:06,50
SOMEONE's eyes shift to her makeup, 

BURLESQUE_DVS272
00:38:03,00 --> 00:38:07,50
then return to the photo. 

BURLESQUE_DVS273
00:38:04,00 --> 00:38:09,50
She picks up a thin makeup brush. 

BURLESQUE_DVS274
00:38:07,00 --> 00:38:11,50
As SOMEONE nears the dressing room, 

BURLESQUE_DVS275
00:38:08,00 --> 00:38:15,50
she stops in the doorway and watches as SOMEONE tries to paint on eyeliner. 

BURLESQUE_DVS276
00:38:12,00 --> 00:38:17,50
The blonde pushes her eyelashes up with a brush 

BURLESQUE_DVS277
00:38:15,00 --> 00:38:18,50
and flinches. 

BURLESQUE_DVS278
00:38:16,00 --> 00:38:20,50
SOMEONE moves beside her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS279
00:38:29,00 --> 00:38:35,50
returns her gaze to the mirror and lifts the brush to her lashes again. 

BURLESQUE_DVS280
00:38:42,00 --> 00:38:47,50
SOMEONE unzips a pouch and withdraws a brush. 

BURLESQUE_DVS281
00:38:44,00 --> 00:38:48,50
She holds it out to SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS282
00:38:48,00 --> 00:38:52,50
As SOMEONE starts up again, 

BURLESQUE_DVS283
00:38:50,00 --> 00:38:54,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS284
00:38:55,00 --> 00:38:58,50
She sits beside her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS285
00:39:11,00 --> 00:39:16,50
She paints black lines along SOMEONE's eyelid. 

BURLESQUE_DVS286
00:39:20,00 --> 00:39:25,50
She applies color to SOMEONE's lids. 

BURLESQUE_DVS287
00:39:53,00 --> 00:39:57,50
SOMEONE grins. 

BURLESQUE_DVS288
00:39:54,00 --> 00:40:00,50
SOMEONE uses a large soft brush to apply rouge to SOMEONE's cheeks. 

BURLESQUE_DVS289
00:40:00,00 --> 00:40:05,50
She playfully taps SOMEONE's nose with the bristles. 

BURLESQUE_DVS290
00:40:09,00 --> 00:40:15,50
Holding SOMEONE' gaze, SOMEONE gives a mild shrug. 

BURLESQUE_DVS291
00:40:13,00 --> 00:40:20,50
With a faint smile, SOMEONE uses another brush to paint lipstick onto SOMEONE's parted lips. 

BURLESQUE_DVS292
00:40:21,00 --> 00:40:26,50
SOMEONE averts her eyes. As she stares off, 

BURLESQUE_DVS293
00:40:23,00 --> 00:40:29,50
SOMEONE skillfully finishes painting her lips. 

BURLESQUE_DVS295
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:32,50
she gently tilts SOMEONE's face and examines her handiwork. 

BURLESQUE_DVS296
00:40:30,00 --> 00:40:36,50
SOMEONE turns to the mirror and sees her red lips and painted eyelids. 

BURLESQUE_DVS297
00:40:36,00 --> 00:40:42,50
Tilting her head back and forth, she touches her face. 

BURLESQUE_DVS298
00:40:43,00 --> 00:40:50,50
Now SOMEONE reaches out of the shower and finds bras and stockings hanging on a hook. 

BURLESQUE_DVS299
00:40:47,00 --> 00:40:53,50
He turns to a towel rack where more undergarments hang. 

BURLESQUE_DVS300
00:40:51,00 --> 00:40:56,50
He spots his towel on the floor. 

BURLESQUE_DVS301
00:40:54,00 --> 00:40:58,50
SOMEONE sleeps in the living room. 

BURLESQUE_DVS302
00:41:02,00 --> 00:41:06,50
He picks up a newspaper. 

BURLESQUE_DVS303
00:41:15,00 --> 00:41:20,50
SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE grabs his phone off the bed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS304
00:41:19,00 --> 00:41:23,50
He swings the bedroom door shut. 

BURLESQUE_DVS305
00:41:22,00 --> 00:41:28,50
Later SOMEONE reads a housing ad in the newspaper. 

BURLESQUE_DVS306
00:41:25,00 --> 00:41:29,50
SOMEONE comes out. 

BURLESQUE_DVS307
00:41:31,00 --> 00:41:35,50
SOMEONE bites her thumb. 

BURLESQUE_DVS308
00:41:35,00 --> 00:41:39,50
pulls on his shirt. 

BURLESQUE_DVS309
00:41:45,00 --> 00:41:49,50
He takes the newspaper from her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS310
00:43:02,00 --> 00:43:06,50
She snatches the paper back. 

BURLESQUE_DVS311
00:43:27,00 --> 00:43:32,50
She backs into his bedroom and closes the doors. 

BURLESQUE_DVS313
00:43:33,00 --> 00:43:41,50
At the lounge, a bartender carries crates of glasses and the band rehearses. SOMEONE storms out of SOMEONE' office. 

BURLESQUE_DVS314
00:43:43,00 --> 00:43:50,50
SOMEONE pauses from organizing costumes on a rack and watches SOMEONE stalk away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS315
00:43:48,00 --> 00:43:54,50
In her office, SOMEONE folds a piece of paper into an airplane. 

BURLESQUE_DVS316
00:43:51,00 --> 00:43:56,50
As she smooths the final crease, creating its wings, 

BURLESQUE_DVS317
00:43:54,00 --> 00:43:57,50
SOMEONE enters. 

BURLESQUE_DVS318
00:43:57,00 --> 00:44:02,50
SOMEONE tosses her paper plane at him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS319
00:43:59,00 --> 00:44:06,50
The backstage manager's gaze follows it as it lands on the floor at his feet. 

BURLESQUE_DVS320
00:44:03,00 --> 00:44:07,50
He picks it up and unfolds it. 

BURLESQUE_DVS321
00:44:21,00 --> 00:44:25,50
SOMEONE crumples the paper. 

BURLESQUE_DVS322
00:44:31,00 --> 00:44:35,50
Averting his gaze, SOMEONE shakes his head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS323
00:44:38,00 --> 00:44:42,50
SOMEONE lifts his chin. 

BURLESQUE_DVS324
00:44:40,00 --> 00:44:44,50
He bows his head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS325
00:44:44,00 --> 00:44:51,50
He locks his eyes with SOMEONE' desperate gaze, then moves forward to the couch where she sits. 

BURLESQUE_DVS326
00:44:51,00 --> 00:44:55,50
He sits beside her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS327
00:44:56,00 --> 00:45:01,50
He wraps his arms around her and she rests her head on his shoulder. 

BURLESQUE_DVS328
00:45:00,00 --> 00:45:04,50
He pats her arm. 

BURLESQUE_DVS329
00:45:02,00 --> 00:45:08,50
Later in the crowded lounge, SOMEONE plays piano with the band. 

BURLESQUE_DVS330
00:45:05,00 --> 00:45:13,50
As the dancers get ready backstage, SOMEONE descends the staircase with a drink in her hand. 

BURLESQUE_DVS331
00:45:10,00 --> 00:45:16,50
Wearing a skimpy biker-themed costume, she heads toward the stage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS332
00:45:23,00 --> 00:45:27,50
SOMEONE sniffs the drink. 

BURLESQUE_DVS333
00:45:47,00 --> 00:45:51,50
SOMEONE pushes SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS334
00:45:51,00 --> 00:45:56,50
SOMEONE throws up her hands. 

BURLESQUE_DVS335
00:45:54,00 --> 00:46:01,50
SOMEONE tosses SOMEONE a costume. Meanwhile, SOMEONE enters the sound booth. 

BURLESQUE_DVS336
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:20,50
SOMEONE watches SOMEONE leave, then moves to his soundboard. Onstage, a spotlight shines on Coco. 

BURLESQUE_DVS337
00:46:25,00 --> 00:46:30,50
The light shines on another dancer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS338
00:46:31,00 --> 00:46:38,50
As the red spotlight fixes on SOMEONE for her turn to lip-sync, SOMEONE pulls a plug. 

BURLESQUE_DVS339
00:46:38,00 --> 00:46:45,50
SOMEONE stops dancing and gazes across the lounge toward the sound booth. 

BURLESQUE_DVS340
00:46:42,00 --> 00:46:49,50
SOMEONE gives a satisfied smile. Meanwhile, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE backstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS341
00:46:56,00 --> 00:47:03,50
Onstage, SOMEONE sees the curtain descending. The doorman eyes departing patrons. 

BURLESQUE_DVS342
00:47:03,00 --> 00:47:08,50
SOMEONE tentatively steps to the front of the stage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS343
00:47:05,00 --> 00:47:11,50
As the curtain continues to drop, she opens her mouth. 

BURLESQUE_DVS344
00:47:12,00 --> 00:47:16,50
SOMEONE, the doorman, and SOMEONE stare. 

BURLESQUE_DVS345
00:47:14,00 --> 00:47:19,50
The curtain freezes above SOMEONE's head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS346
00:47:26,00 --> 00:47:32,50
SOMEONE moves closer. SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare, awestruck. 

BURLESQUE_DVS347
00:47:32,00 --> 00:47:38,50
The stagehand pulls a rope and the curtain rises back to the ceiling. 

BURLESQUE_DVS348
00:47:43,00 --> 00:47:50,50
A stagehand swivels a spotlight onto SOMEONE. As the band joins her, she struts toward the audience. 

BURLESQUE_DVS349
00:47:53,00 --> 00:48:00,50
Dancing, she swings her hips from side to side. SOMEONE smiles and shakes her head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS350
00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:16,50
Audience members bop their heads and shimmy their shoulders. SOMEONE grins. 

BURLESQUE_DVS351
00:48:13,00 --> 00:48:17,50
SOMEONE tips her biker cap. 

BURLESQUE_DVS352
00:48:34,00 --> 00:48:47,50
The crowd claps and the two dancers behind SOMEONE sing backup as they step from side to side. SOMEONE glares down at them. SOMEONE beckons the backup dancers and they join her downstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS353
00:48:58,00 --> 00:49:04,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE exchange a disbelieving look. 

BURLESQUE_DVS354
00:49:01,00 --> 00:49:07,50
SOMEONE grabs a musician out of the band and pulls him onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS355
00:49:04,00 --> 00:49:09,50
Dancing around her, he plays the tambourine. 

BURLESQUE_DVS356
00:49:19,00 --> 00:49:26,50
SOMEONE strikes a pose with her arms in the air and the stage lights blink off. 

BURLESQUE_DVS357
00:49:23,00 --> 00:49:29,50
As Coco hugs SOMEONE, the crowd rises in a standing ovation. 

BURLESQUE_DVS358
00:49:27,00 --> 00:49:33,50
SOMEONE storms out of the sound booth with a sour expression. 

BURLESQUE_DVS359
00:49:30,00 --> 00:49:37,50
A spotlight fades up onstage and the bartenders, including SOMEONE, clap for the performers. 

BURLESQUE_DVS360
00:49:35,00 --> 00:49:40,50
SOMEONE's backup dancers push her forward. 

BURLESQUE_DVS361
00:49:37,00 --> 00:49:42,50
She curtsies, then bows with the others. 

BURLESQUE_DVS362
00:49:39,00 --> 00:49:43,50
The curtain falls. 

BURLESQUE_DVS363
00:49:45,00 --> 00:49:51,50
Backstage, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the other dancers crowd around. 

BURLESQUE_DVS364
00:50:02,00 --> 00:50:06,50
SOMEONE looks on. 

BURLESQUE_DVS365
00:50:24,00 --> 00:50:31,50
SOMEONE's jaw drops. SOMEONE gives her dancers a thumbs up, then turns to SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS366
00:50:32,00 --> 00:50:36,50
SOMEONE glares at her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS367
00:50:38,00 --> 00:50:44,50
With a smile, SOMEONE strides away. SOMEONE juts out her chin. 

BURLESQUE_DVS368
00:50:42,00 --> 00:50:47,50
As the dancers disperse, SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS369
00:51:10,00 --> 00:51:17,50
He heads away, passing SOMEONE, who stares at SOMEONE, her arms crossed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS370
00:51:14,00 --> 00:51:18,50
She smiles. 

BURLESQUE_DVS371
00:51:19,00 --> 00:51:24,50
She turns away with a conniving smirk. 

BURLESQUE_DVS372
00:51:21,00 --> 00:51:28,50
Now SOMEONE exits the backstage area and finds SOMEONE waiting for her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS373
00:51:25,00 --> 00:51:29,50
Grinning, he claps. 

BURLESQUE_DVS374
00:51:42,00 --> 00:51:47,50
SOMEONE nods as she walks off. 

BURLESQUE_DVS375
00:51:45,00 --> 00:51:52,50
After hours, SOMEONE and the other dancers hang out at the bar with SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS376
00:52:04,00 --> 00:52:09,50
SOMEONE gets up. Coco looks at SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS377
00:52:10,00 --> 00:52:16,50
SOMEONE shifts her gaze from Coco to another dancer, who nods. 

BURLESQUE_DVS378
00:52:16,00 --> 00:52:21,50
SOMEONE stares after her as she leaves with them. 

BURLESQUE_DVS379
00:52:38,00 --> 00:52:42,50
He pretends to think. 

BURLESQUE_DVS380
00:52:58,00 --> 00:53:04,50
As SOMEONE grabs her stuff, SOMEONE self-consciously looks away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS381
00:53:07,00 --> 00:53:12,50
With a smile, SOMEONE cocks his head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS382
00:53:11,00 --> 00:53:15,50
SOMEONE moves to his side. 

BURLESQUE_DVS383
00:53:13,00 --> 00:53:17,50
He points to a mirror. 

BURLESQUE_DVS384
00:53:20,00 --> 00:53:24,50
He sweeps her hair up. 

BURLESQUE_DVS385
00:53:29,00 --> 00:53:37,50
She gives the bald man a playful nudge. Now a light rises on SOMEONE in a platinum bobbed wig. 

BURLESQUE_DVS386
00:53:43,00 --> 00:53:47,50
She rises from the chaise lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS387
00:53:56,00 --> 00:54:00,50
SOMEONE watches dreamily. 

BURLESQUE_DVS388
00:54:01,00 --> 00:54:05,50
She tugs on a gold rope. 

BURLESQUE_DVS389
00:54:07,00 --> 00:54:12,50
As the curtain rises, SOMEONE resumes his work. 

BURLESQUE_DVS390
00:54:10,00 --> 00:54:20,50
SOMEONE makes her way up some stairs, toward a platform. She tosses her head and shoulders back with each beat, then wiggles her hips at the crowd. 

BURLESQUE_DVS391
00:54:17,00 --> 00:54:24,50
Bending forward, she shakes her rear and the feathers on her short skirt flutter. 

BURLESQUE_DVS392
00:54:22,00 --> 00:54:27,50
She sits on a step and kicks her feet in the air. 

BURLESQUE_DVS393
00:54:24,00 --> 00:54:36,50
Facing the audience, she quickly spreads her knees, then crosses her legs. She dances up the rest of the stairs to the platform where another curtain opens, revealing more dancers. 

BURLESQUE_DVS394
00:55:10,00 --> 00:55:14,50
Now SOMEONE dances on the bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS395
00:55:12,00 --> 00:55:25,50
As a glass slides toward her, she kicks it out of the way. She struts to the wall of mirrored panels behind the bar and strikes a pose. As she pushes on one panel, it spins and she disappears behind it. 

BURLESQUE_DVS396
00:55:23,00 --> 00:55:30,50
A different panel spins and SOMEONE rotates into the room, then whirls away again. 

BURLESQUE_DVS397
00:55:27,00 --> 00:55:33,50
All of the panels turn with dancers in front of each. 

BURLESQUE_DVS398
00:55:30,00 --> 00:55:35,50
A bartender leans forward, 

BURLESQUE_DVS399
00:55:32,00 --> 00:55:37,50
bridging the wall and the bar with his back. 

BURLESQUE_DVS400
00:55:34,00 --> 00:55:39,50
Two others lead SOMEONE across. 

BURLESQUE_DVS401
00:55:44,00 --> 00:55:51,50
She swoons backwards off the bar. Two bartenders catch her and carry her to the chaise lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS402
00:55:51,00 --> 00:55:56,50
She pretends to take a shot. 

BURLESQUE_DVS403
00:55:56,00 --> 00:56:00,50
The stage lights turn off. 

BURLESQUE_DVS404
00:55:57,00 --> 00:56:06,50
Later as SOMEONE works behind the bar, SOMEONE appears, still in her short sequined dress and platinum blonde wig. 

BURLESQUE_DVS405
00:56:06,00 --> 00:56:10,50
SOMEONE gives her a sidelong look. 

BURLESQUE_DVS406
00:56:09,00 --> 00:56:13,50
She spins on her stool. 

BURLESQUE_DVS407
00:56:21,00 --> 00:56:27,50
Her smile fades and she walks away. SOMEONE stares after her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS409
00:56:33,00 --> 00:56:37,50
SOMEONE struggles to uncap a spray bottle. 

BURLESQUE_DVS410
00:56:37,00 --> 00:56:43,50
SOMEONE easily removes the cap, then leans closer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS411
00:56:42,00 --> 00:56:47,50
SOMEONE gapes as SOMEONE strides away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS412
00:56:44,00 --> 00:56:48,50
In the lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS413
00:56:48,00 --> 00:56:54,50
SOMEONE sets drinks on Marcus' table and sits across from him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS415
00:57:39,00 --> 00:57:43,50
at SOMEONE's place. 

BURLESQUE_DVS416
00:57:41,00 --> 00:57:49,50
Coming home, SOMEONE spies SOMEONE in the bedroom, wearing only pink panties and a matching bra. 

BURLESQUE_DVS417
00:57:46,00 --> 00:57:51,50
He steps further into the apartment, 

BURLESQUE_DVS418
00:57:48,00 --> 00:57:53,50
his mesmerized gaze fixed on her curves. 

BURLESQUE_DVS419
00:57:51,00 --> 00:57:56,50
His bag topples candles on the coffee table. 

BURLESQUE_DVS420
00:57:56,00 --> 00:58:00,50
He returns to the door. 

BURLESQUE_DVS421
00:58:04,00 --> 00:58:09,50
SOMEONE joins her at a mirror and zips up her dress. 

BURLESQUE_DVS422
00:58:15,00 --> 00:58:20,50
He notices SOMEONE's photo. 

BURLESQUE_DVS424
00:58:33,00 --> 00:58:38,50
SOMEONE glances up at him with a winsome pout. 

BURLESQUE_DVS425
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:44,50
SOMEONE smiles warmly as she holds his gaze. 

BURLESQUE_DVS426
00:58:50,00 --> 00:58:55,50
Grinning boyishly, he steps away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS427
00:58:52,00 --> 00:58:56,50
SOMEONE's smile fades. 

BURLESQUE_DVS428
00:58:56,00 --> 00:59:04,50
Now feather fans lift away to reveal SOMEONE reclined on the lounge piano, in a skimpy two-piece outfit made of pearls. 

BURLESQUE_DVS429
00:59:18,00 --> 00:59:25,50
She pushes the pianist's head past her lap, then shimmies her pearls. 

BURLESQUE_DVS430
00:59:22,00 --> 00:59:28,50
At home, SOMEONE and SOMEONE share a comfortable laugh in the living room. 

BURLESQUE_DVS431
00:59:25,00 --> 00:59:32,50
At the lounge, SOMEONE pops a champagne bottle's cork and smirks. 

BURLESQUE_DVS432
00:59:48,00 --> 00:59:54,50
At a table, SOMEONE thoughtfully rubs his chin as he watches her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS433
00:59:58,00 --> 01:00:05,50
Now as she rides with SOMEONE on his motorcycle, her sheer scarf flies away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS434
01:00:11,00 --> 01:00:17,50
As SOMEONE puts her back to the audience, her top flies off. 

BURLESQUE_DVS435
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:23,50
A dancer hands her a fan and she covers her chest. Turning away, she lowers the fan and shimmies. 

BURLESQUE_DVS436
01:00:20,00 --> 01:00:25,50
Quickly covering herself, she faces the crowd again. 

BURLESQUE_DVS437
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:35,50
Her pearl briefs fly off. She snatches another fan from a dancer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS438
01:00:33,00 --> 01:00:39,50
Now SOMEONE hurries into the dressing room with a giddy smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS439
01:00:38,00 --> 01:00:44,50
She shows an engagement ring. The girls rush to hug her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS440
01:00:42,00 --> 01:00:46,50
Back onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS441
01:00:49,00 --> 01:00:56,50
Peeking out from behind a fan, she comically blows feathers and hair out of her face. 

BURLESQUE_DVS442
01:00:53,00 --> 01:01:02,50
Now SOMEONE blows out birthday candles. Standing apart, SOMEONE snaps a photo, then smiles and winks at her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS443
01:00:59,00 --> 01:01:04,50
SOMEONE gazes tenderly at him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS444
01:01:01,00 --> 01:01:06,50
Onstage, she shimmies her fans. 

BURLESQUE_DVS445
01:01:04,00 --> 01:01:10,50
As she flings them away, her backup dancers raise two more in their place. 

BURLESQUE_DVS446
01:01:08,00 --> 01:01:13,50
They part the fans, revealing her naked form. 

BURLESQUE_DVS447
01:01:10,00 --> 01:01:17,50
A pair of bongos cover her breasts and a candle conceals her crotch. 

BURLESQUE_DVS448
01:01:14,00 --> 01:01:20,50
SOMEONE winks. Later she meets SOMEONE at the bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS449
01:01:21,00 --> 01:01:25,50
He stares, slack-jawed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS450
01:01:32,00 --> 01:01:37,50
SOMEONE carries a crate of glasses away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS451
01:01:37,00 --> 01:01:42,50
SOMEONE arrives at SOMEONE's side. 

BURLESQUE_DVS452
01:01:51,00 --> 01:01:54,50
He grabs her bag. 

BURLESQUE_DVS453
01:02:01,00 --> 01:02:08,50
Later SOMEONE rides in a vintage convertible speedster as SOMEONE drives. 

BURLESQUE_DVS454
01:02:38,00 --> 01:02:42,50
SOMEONE shakes her head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS455
01:02:39,00 --> 01:02:44,50
The speedster makes a turn. 

BURLESQUE_DVS456
01:02:41,00 --> 01:02:47,50
Later it pulls up outside a glamorous party. 

BURLESQUE_DVS457
01:02:44,00 --> 01:02:49,50
Primping, SOMEONE takes her hair down. 

BURLESQUE_DVS458
01:02:46,00 --> 01:02:53,50
As she and SOMEONE enter, several trendy upscale guests take notice. 

BURLESQUE_DVS459
01:02:52,00 --> 01:03:00,50
He takes her into a kitchen staffed with caterers and grabs one of the many bottles of wine. 

BURLESQUE_DVS460
01:03:01,00 --> 01:03:06,50
He takes two glasses and a tray of hors d'oeuvres. 

BURLESQUE_DVS461
01:03:08,00 --> 01:03:13,50
Leading her downstairs, he meets two guests., 

BURLESQUE_DVS462
01:03:21,00 --> 01:03:25,50
SOMEONE leads SOMEONE onward. 

BURLESQUE_DVS463
01:03:33,00 --> 01:03:37,50
She halts in a doorway. 

BURLESQUE_DVS464
01:03:36,00 --> 01:03:40,50
A city view. 

BURLESQUE_DVS465
01:04:12,00 --> 01:04:17,50
SOMEONE gives her a smirk and sips his wine. 

BURLESQUE_DVS466
01:04:34,00 --> 01:04:40,50
Turning away, SOMEONE sips her wine with a cynical smirk. 

BURLESQUE_DVS467
01:04:37,00 --> 01:04:43,50
Now SOMEONE lies on the daybed with his eyes closed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS468
01:04:41,00 --> 01:04:46,50
His eyes open as SOMEONE arrives home. 

BURLESQUE_DVS469
01:04:44,00 --> 01:04:49,50
Now a gift box sits on a dressing-room stool. 

BURLESQUE_DVS470
01:04:53,00 --> 01:04:59,50
SOMEONE reads the card: To the best view in LA - SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS471
01:04:57,00 --> 01:05:05,50
As the other girls look on, she opens the present and pulls out a pair of Louboutin shoes just like SOMEONE's. 

BURLESQUE_DVS472
01:05:09,00 --> 01:05:14,50
SOMEONE marches over and grabs the card. 

BURLESQUE_DVS473
01:05:15,00 --> 01:05:20,50
As she reads it, her smirk fades. 

BURLESQUE_DVS474
01:05:30,00 --> 01:05:34,50
SOMEONE leaves. 

BURLESQUE_DVS475
01:05:40,00 --> 01:05:45,50
Facing her mirror, SOMEONE dons a bowler hat. 

BURLESQUE_DVS476
01:06:03,00 --> 01:06:11,50
Now with the stage set to resemble the dressing room, SOMEONE and the dancers mime preparations for a show. 

BURLESQUE_DVS477
01:06:09,00 --> 01:06:17,50
The fake mirrors whisk upstage and three more dancers crawl out of them to simple wooden chairs. 

BURLESQUE_DVS478
01:06:14,00 --> 01:06:21,50
SOMEONE and the first two dancers pose erotically in their own chairs and snap their fingers. 

BURLESQUE_DVS479
01:06:18,00 --> 01:06:23,50
A dance begins. 

BURLESQUE_DVS481
01:06:57,00 --> 01:07:02,50
SOMEONE watches from his corner table. 

BURLESQUE_DVS482
01:06:59,00 --> 01:07:07,50
At home, SOMEONE adds notations to sheet music, then stares thoughtfully at it. SOMEONE arrives. 

BURLESQUE_DVS483
01:07:07,00 --> 01:07:13,50
As she removes her coat, he shakes his head and smiles. 

BURLESQUE_DVS484
01:07:21,00 --> 01:07:26,50
He notices her Louboutins. 

BURLESQUE_DVS485
01:07:28,00 --> 01:07:33,50
He watches from his keyboard as she walks into the bedroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS487
01:07:43,00 --> 01:07:48,50
her costume bears two handprints on her buttocks. 

BURLESQUE_DVS488
01:07:55,00 --> 01:08:09,50
SOMEONE works her hands up her body to her hair. Her backup dancers move upside-down on their chairs in acrobatic positions. At home, SOMEONE struts in her sparkly four-inch Louboutins as she puts on the new outfit. 

BURLESQUE_DVS489
01:08:28,00 --> 01:08:33,50
She leaves. Onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS492
01:08:41,00 --> 01:08:46,50
At the entrance, a long line appears. 

BURLESQUE_DVS493
01:08:46,00 --> 01:08:51,50
Back inside the packed lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS494
01:08:57,00 --> 01:09:02,50
Looking on, SOMEONE smiles proudly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS495
01:09:05,00 --> 01:09:13,50
SOMEONE lifts her knee in a sexy pose with one of her backup dancers. SOMEONE seethes as she watches. 

BURLESQUE_DVS496
01:09:13,00 --> 01:09:19,50
Mesmerized by the performance, SOMEONE interlaces his fingers. 

BURLESQUE_DVS497
01:09:17,00 --> 01:09:22,50
Now he drives SOMEONE in his vintage convertible. 

BURLESQUE_DVS498
01:09:19,00 --> 01:09:26,50
At his home, they share an intimate laugh as they sit on the couch by candlelight. 

BURLESQUE_DVS499
01:09:24,00 --> 01:09:31,50
Back in the lounge, the dancers advance downstage, reaching their hands toward the audience. 

BURLESQUE_DVS500
01:09:28,00 --> 01:09:36,50
SOMEONE turns in profile and bumps her shoulders forward into an animalistic slouch. 

BURLESQUE_DVS501
01:09:33,00 --> 01:09:39,50
Spreading their legs, the dancers bend over and whip their hair. 

BURLESQUE_DVS502
01:09:46,00 --> 01:09:55,50
At home, SOMEONE finds a note taped to a mirror written on sheet music paper: Going out. See you tomorrow - SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS503
01:09:52,00 --> 01:09:56,50
Back onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS504
01:10:00,00 --> 01:10:07,50
SOMEONE and the others dance with precision and raw sensuality as the stage lights strobe. 

BURLESQUE_DVS505
01:10:06,00 --> 01:10:14,50
Now a makeup mirror reflects a newspaper photo of SOMEONE performing in the burlesque lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS506
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:19,50
SOMEONE smiles in her office as she reads the article on the front page of the LA Times Calendar section. 

BURLESQUE_DVS507
01:10:17,00 --> 01:10:22,50
The photo shows SOMEONE with Coco and another dancer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS508
01:10:20,00 --> 01:10:30,50
SOMEONE sets down the paper and picks up a bank letter headed, Notice of Defaulted Payment. A red stamp reads, Final Notice. 

BURLESQUE_DVS509
01:10:28,00 --> 01:10:33,50
SOMEONE crumples it up. 

BURLESQUE_DVS510
01:10:31,00 --> 01:10:37,50
In the dressing room, the girls huddle around the newspaper feature. 

BURLESQUE_DVS511
01:10:39,00 --> 01:10:43,50
Coco faces SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS512
01:10:47,00 --> 01:10:58,50
Meanwhile, two contortionists lie with their chins to the stage. Posed in deep backbends, they flick their toes over their heads. The doorman crouches between them. 

BURLESQUE_DVS513
01:10:57,00 --> 01:11:01,50
They scissor kick. 

BURLESQUE_DVS514
01:10:58,00 --> 01:11:07,50
One does a handstand and wraps her thighs around the doorman. The other sticks her leg straight up along his back. 

BURLESQUE_DVS515
01:11:06,00 --> 01:11:10,50
At Marcus' table. 

BURLESQUE_DVS516
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:13,50
SOMEONE arrives. 

BURLESQUE_DVS517
01:11:28,00 --> 01:11:33,50
The doorman falls face-first into a contortionist's crotch. 

BURLESQUE_DVS518
01:11:31,00 --> 01:11:36,50
A patron spits out his drink with laughter. 

BURLESQUE_DVS519
01:11:37,00 --> 01:11:43,50
From the bar, SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch SOMEONE with the two men. 

BURLESQUE_DVS520
01:11:43,00 --> 01:11:54,50
One of the contortionists passes the doorman a banana between her legs. He peels it, then gets distracted by her breasts, and lowers the phallic fruit to his crotch. 

BURLESQUE_DVS521
01:11:52,00 --> 01:11:57,50
The other contortionist deep-throats it. 

BURLESQUE_DVS522
01:11:54,00 --> 01:12:01,50
From a table overlooking the crowd, SOMEONE notices SOMEONE with SOMEONE and Harold. 

BURLESQUE_DVS523
01:11:58,00 --> 01:12:02,50
SOMEONE arrives at her side. 

BURLESQUE_DVS524
01:12:17,00 --> 01:12:26,50
One contortionist spreads her legs overhead and the doorman strikes a triangle between her thighs. Now in the dressing room. 

BURLESQUE_DVS525
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:23,50
She picks up her clutch purse. 

BURLESQUE_DVS526
01:13:22,00 --> 01:13:27,50
SOMEONE gives an affectionate smile as SOMEONE walks away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS527
01:13:26,00 --> 01:13:31,50
She bites her lip worriedly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS528
01:13:30,00 --> 01:13:34,50
SOMEONE brings costumes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS529
01:13:37,00 --> 01:13:42,50
SOMEONE glances after SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS530
01:13:40,00 --> 01:13:44,50
He kisses SOMEONE' cheek. 

BURLESQUE_DVS531
01:13:43,00 --> 01:13:48,50
She watches him go with a grateful smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS532
01:13:45,00 --> 01:13:52,50
Now she enters the stage area, her arms loaded with costumes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS533
01:13:49,00 --> 01:13:54,50
SOMEONE calls out from the deejay booth. 

BURLESQUE_DVS534
01:14:11,00 --> 01:14:16,50
She drops the costumes, then removes her 

BURLESQUE_DVS535
01:14:13,00 --> 01:14:20,50
coat, revealing a black sparkling top with a matching cardigan and pants. 

BURLESQUE_DVS536
01:14:21,00 --> 01:14:26,50
She climbs wearily onto the stage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS537
01:14:23,00 --> 01:14:30,50
SOMEONE puts on a CD labeled, Instrumental Only, Last of Me. 

BURLESQUE_DVS538
01:14:27,00 --> 01:14:31,50
He cuts the stage lights. 

BURLESQUE_DVS539
01:14:28,00 --> 01:14:34,50
SOMEONE places a chair center stage and straddles it. 

BURLESQUE_DVS540
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:37,50
SOMEONE focuses a blue-tinted spotlight on her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS541
01:17:55,00 --> 01:18:01,50
Silhouetted by an offstage light, she strolls away stoically. 

BURLESQUE_DVS542
01:17:59,00 --> 01:18:06,50
SOMEONE gazes after her with a small admiring nod, then switches off the spotlight. 

BURLESQUE_DVS543
01:18:03,00 --> 01:18:07,50
SOMEONE steps outside with 

BURLESQUE_DVS544
01:18:05,00 --> 01:18:10,50
costumes and heads down the entrance stairs. 

BURLESQUE_DVS545
01:18:07,00 --> 01:18:11,50
SOMEONE waits for her at the bottom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS546
01:18:09,00 --> 01:18:14,50
Wearing fingerless leather gloves, she takes a drag off a cigarette. 

BURLESQUE_DVS548
01:19:23,00 --> 01:19:29,50
SOMEONE gets in a convertible and wrestles her bag down beside her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS549
01:19:34,00 --> 01:19:43,50
SOMEONE gives an incredulous stare. As SOMEONE backs out of her spot, her old mentor tosses her keys down onto her car's trunk. 

BURLESQUE_DVS550
01:19:41,00 --> 01:19:49,50
SOMEONE takes out a crowbar and smashes SOMEONE's passenger window as she drives past. The car stops abruptly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS551
01:19:49,00 --> 01:19:58,50
With an indignant gape, she peels off. SOMEONE flings the crowbar back into her trunk then turns and leans on the bumper. 

BURLESQUE_DVS552
01:19:58,00 --> 01:20:04,50
Now SOMEONE arrives home in a red clingy dress. 

BURLESQUE_DVS553
01:20:02,00 --> 01:20:09,50
Eyeing the daybed, she pauses briefly, then crosses to the French doors and opens them. 

BURLESQUE_DVS554
01:20:07,00 --> 01:20:11,50
She finds SOMEONE sleeping in the bed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS555
01:20:10,00 --> 01:20:15,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes resentfully and pulls the doors shut. 

BURLESQUE_DVS556
01:20:17,00 --> 01:20:25,50
Now in their apartment, SOMEONE irritably grinds coffee. SOMEONE stirs awake in the red cocktail dress. 

BURLESQUE_DVS557
01:22:13,00 --> 01:22:19,50
He shuts the bedroom doors. She flings a pillow at a lamp. 

BURLESQUE_DVS558
01:22:22,00 --> 01:22:26,50
Now at a wedding. 

BURLESQUE_DVS559
01:22:27,00 --> 01:22:32,50
SOMEONE kisses Damon. 

BURLESQUE_DVS560
01:22:29,00 --> 01:22:35,50
Later at the reception, SOMEONE watches SOMEONE talk on his cell phone. 

BURLESQUE_DVS561
01:22:53,00 --> 01:23:00,50
With his eyes on SOMEONE, he lowers the phone. Now SOMEONE sits with Coco. 

BURLESQUE_DVS562
01:23:13,00 --> 01:23:19,50
As SOMEONE sips his drink, the deejay grins at him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS563
01:23:18,00 --> 01:23:21,50
At a bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS564
01:23:31,00 --> 01:23:36,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE dance. 

BURLESQUE_DVS565
01:24:03,00 --> 01:24:08,50
He hugs her from behind. 

BURLESQUE_DVS566
01:24:09,00 --> 01:24:13,50
He kisses her cheek. 

BURLESQUE_DVS567
01:24:13,00 --> 01:24:21,50
Now leaning on the bar, SOMEONE sips the last of a cocktail. SOMEONE approaches and leans on the bar beside him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS568
01:24:38,00 --> 01:24:42,50
She ignores his toast. 

BURLESQUE_DVS569
01:24:42,00 --> 01:24:47,50
SOMEONE giggles, then downs her shot. 

BURLESQUE_DVS570
01:24:45,00 --> 01:24:51,50
SOMEONE nudges her with his elbow and leans in close. 

BURLESQUE_DVS571
01:25:02,00 --> 01:25:09,50
He points at the deejay, who points back. As SOMEONE leaves the bar, SOMEONE grabs her hand. 

BURLESQUE_DVS572
01:25:10,00 --> 01:25:15,50
They face each other on the dance floor. 

BURLESQUE_DVS573
01:25:41,00 --> 01:25:45,50
He grins. 

BURLESQUE_DVS574
01:25:44,00 --> 01:25:48,50
They dance. 

BURLESQUE_DVS575
01:25:47,00 --> 01:25:51,50
He spins her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS577
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:58,50
As they enter the darkened apartment, SOMEONE knocks over a lamp. 

BURLESQUE_DVS578
01:26:10,00 --> 01:26:14,50
He bumps the lamp again. 

BURLESQUE_DVS579
01:26:16,00 --> 01:26:23,50
SOMEONE looks demurely up at him from the daybed. SOMEONE smiles genteelly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS580
01:26:25,00 --> 01:26:29,50
He hands SOMEONE her shoes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS581
01:26:29,00 --> 01:26:34,50
SOMEONE steps into the bedroom and shuts the doors. 

BURLESQUE_DVS582
01:26:32,00 --> 01:26:37,50
A disappointed SOMEONE glances after him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS583
01:26:34,00 --> 01:26:40,50
He reopens the doors, wearing bright red pajamas. 

BURLESQUE_DVS584
01:26:47,00 --> 01:26:52,50
He flourishes his arms. 

BURLESQUE_DVS585
01:26:59,00 --> 01:27:04,50
She watches him cross back to the bedroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS586
01:27:06,00 --> 01:27:10,50
He shuts the doors. 

BURLESQUE_DVS587
01:27:09,00 --> 01:27:14,50
He reopens the doors, shirtless. 

BURLESQUE_DVS588
01:27:17,00 --> 01:27:23,50
As he enters the kitchen, she admires his toned back on the sly. 

BURLESQUE_DVS589
01:27:22,00 --> 01:27:28,50
As he returns to the bedroom, she checks him out again. 

BURLESQUE_DVS590
01:27:25,00 --> 01:27:31,50
SOMEONE spins around in the doorway and SOMEONE shakes her head. 

BURLESQUE_DVS591
01:27:35,00 --> 01:27:41,50
SOMEONE removes her earrings, her back to the bedroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS592
01:27:38,00 --> 01:27:42,50
SOMEONE reemerges naked. 

BURLESQUE_DVS593
01:27:40,00 --> 01:27:45,50
A chair, then a lamp conveniently hide his groin. 

BURLESQUE_DVS594
01:27:49,00 --> 01:27:53,50
SOMEONE still has her back to him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS595
01:27:53,00 --> 01:27:57,50
SOMEONE sees his bare tush. 

BURLESQUE_DVS596
01:27:56,00 --> 01:28:00,50
She covers her eyes, but peeks. 

BURLESQUE_DVS597
01:28:01,00 --> 01:28:08,50
He innocently holds a box of Famous Amos cookies over his privates. 

BURLESQUE_DVS598
01:28:12,00 --> 01:28:16,50
He returns to the bedroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS599
01:28:22,00 --> 01:28:26,50
He shuts the French doors. 

BURLESQUE_DVS600
01:28:28,00 --> 01:28:33,50
As SOMEONE looks over her shoulder, the bedroom lights go out. 

BURLESQUE_DVS601
01:28:33,00 --> 01:28:40,50
She lowers her disappointed gaze and purses her lips, then gets up from the daybed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS602
01:28:40,00 --> 01:28:45,50
Reaching behind her back, she goes to unzip her dress. 

BURLESQUE_DVS604
01:28:45,00 --> 01:28:50,50
SOMEONE reopens the doors. 

BURLESQUE_DVS605
01:28:49,00 --> 01:28:57,50
With a smoldering gaze, he steps out of the bedroom and approaches SOMEONE, then gently brushes her long blonde hair off her shoulder. 

BURLESQUE_DVS606
01:28:58,00 --> 01:29:04,50
He kisses her smooth neck and they share a peck on the lips. 

BURLESQUE_DVS610
01:29:10,00 --> 01:29:15,50
Facing each other, SOMEONE runs his fingers through her hair. They kiss again. 

BURLESQUE_DVS611
01:29:12,00 --> 01:29:18,50
They gaze into each other's eyes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS614
01:29:54,00 --> 01:30:00,50
Daytime. In bed, SOMEONE rests her head on SOMEONE's chest. 

BURLESQUE_DVS615
01:30:09,00 --> 01:30:15,50
Pouring rain streaks their bedroom window. 

BURLESQUE_DVS616
01:30:12,00 --> 01:30:18,50
Onstage, SOMEONE sings in a satiny chartreuse gown. 

BURLESQUE_DVS617
01:30:53,00 --> 01:30:58,50
The image dissolves from SOMEONE onstage to the bedroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS618
01:30:56,00 --> 01:31:02,50
SOMEONE lies in bed with a camera as SOMEONE pulls a black stocking over her knee. 

BURLESQUE_DVS619
01:31:05,00 --> 01:31:11,50
She pulls the stocking back down her leg, then bites her bottom lip. 

BURLESQUE_DVS620
01:31:08,00 --> 01:31:12,50
SOMEONE beckons. 

BURLESQUE_DVS621
01:31:12,00 --> 01:31:17,50
Onstage, SOMEONE sings to a full house. 

BURLESQUE_DVS622
01:31:51,00 --> 01:31:55,50
They lounge in bed. 

BURLESQUE_DVS623
01:32:32,00 --> 01:32:36,50
They embrace. 

BURLESQUE_DVS624
01:32:33,00 --> 01:32:37,50
Back onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS625
01:33:35,00 --> 01:33:42,50
Silhouetted against a brilliant spotlight, SOMEONE closes her hands and gently lowers her arms. 

BURLESQUE_DVS626
01:33:44,00 --> 01:33:49,50
Now a young woman enters the apartment. 

BURLESQUE_DVS627
01:33:49,00 --> 01:33:58,50
She sets down a suitcase and tosses aside her keys. Scanning the living room, she finds an article of clothing. 

BURLESQUE_DVS628
01:33:56,00 --> 01:34:00,50
She barges into the bedroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS629
01:34:38,00 --> 01:34:42,50
She shoves past him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS630
01:34:43,00 --> 01:34:48,50
Now SOMEONE's wedding deejay opens a front door. 

BURLESQUE_DVS631
01:35:09,00 --> 01:35:13,50
In SOMEONE's bedroom. 

BURLESQUE_DVS632
01:35:14,00 --> 01:35:19,50
SOMEONE looks up from his bed and they smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS633
01:35:41,00 --> 01:35:46,50
Wearing only a blanket, SOMEONE covers up. 

BURLESQUE_DVS634
01:36:12,00 --> 01:36:17,50
In the kitchen, SOMEONE makes coffee. 

BURLESQUE_DVS635
01:36:33,00 --> 01:36:38,50
SOMEONE sighs and lowers a spoon. 

BURLESQUE_DVS636
01:36:37,00 --> 01:36:43,50
Now at Jacks apartment. SOMEONE leaves with her luggage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS637
01:36:40,00 --> 01:36:46,50
Later at SOMEONE's second floor apartment, SOMEONE steps outside. 

BURLESQUE_DVS638
01:36:59,00 --> 01:37:04,50
SOMEONE pulls into the driveway on his motorcycle. 

BURLESQUE_DVS639
01:37:05,00 --> 01:37:10,50
SOMEONE passes the deejay on his way upstairs. 

BURLESQUE_DVS640
01:37:24,00 --> 01:37:27,50
He heads off. 

BURLESQUE_DVS641
01:37:25,00 --> 01:37:30,50
SOMEONE looks pointedly after SOMEONE walking to his car. 

BURLESQUE_DVS642
01:37:29,00 --> 01:37:33,50
SOMEONE turns. 

BURLESQUE_DVS643
01:37:46,00 --> 01:37:50,50
Now in SOMEONE' office. 

BURLESQUE_DVS645
01:39:32,00 --> 01:39:36,50
SOMEONE heads for the door. 

BURLESQUE_DVS646
01:39:41,00 --> 01:39:51,50
Now at Marcus' contemporary three-story mansion, SOMEONE walks up a staircase to the top floor and its breathtaking view of the city. 

BURLESQUE_DVS647
01:39:52,00 --> 01:39:59,50
She looks out a window and spots SOMEONE pacing outside on his phone. 

BURLESQUE_DVS648
01:39:57,00 --> 01:40:04,50
She leaves the window and regards an architectural model of a city block set up on a table. 

BURLESQUE_DVS649
01:40:04,00 --> 01:40:09,50
SOMEONE notes an address on the model: 

BURLESQUE_DVS650
01:40:06,00 --> 01:40:11,50
8080 Sunset Boulevard. 

BURLESQUE_DVS651
01:40:08,00 --> 01:40:13,50
SOMEONE joins her and hands her a coffee mug. 

BURLESQUE_DVS652
01:40:59,00 --> 01:41:03,50
She grabs her jacket. 

BURLESQUE_DVS653
01:41:10,00 --> 01:41:15,50
She walks out and leaves SOMEONE standing alone. 

BURLESQUE_DVS654
01:41:15,00 --> 01:41:21,50
Now we descend to the lit-up sign for the Burlesque Lounge. 

BURLESQUE_DVS655
01:41:18,00 --> 01:41:25,50
Inside SOMEONE crosses a dim hallway adorned with memorabilia. 

BURLESQUE_DVS656
01:41:22,00 --> 01:41:30,50
She stops and takes a second long look at a red neon sign which reads, The Best View on the Sunset Strip. 

BURLESQUE_DVS657
01:41:28,00 --> 01:41:32,50
SOMEONE hurries on. 

BURLESQUE_DVS658
01:41:29,00 --> 01:41:36,50
Onstage, dancers move in unison while the seated band performs. 

BURLESQUE_DVS659
01:41:33,00 --> 01:41:38,50
In the dressing room, SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS660
01:41:43,00 --> 01:41:47,50
She holds up a bottle of tequila. 

BURLESQUE_DVS661
01:42:22,00 --> 01:42:26,50
SOMEONE enters SOMEONE' office. 

BURLESQUE_DVS662
01:42:41,00 --> 01:42:47,50
SOMEONE lowers her gaze, then looks up and gives an amused roll of the eyes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS663
01:42:54,00 --> 01:43:00,50
Onstage, the dancers finish their number to the delight of a packed house. 

BURLESQUE_DVS664
01:43:01,00 --> 01:43:08,50
Now SOMEONE chats with SOMEONE as they exit the lounge, passing under its unlit archway. 

BURLESQUE_DVS665
01:43:05,00 --> 01:43:15,50
They head across the street to the high-rise of luxury condos. Inside, a white-haired man sits at a desk, talking on the phone. 

BURLESQUE_DVS666
01:43:12,00 --> 01:43:17,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE enter his office. 

BURLESQUE_DVS667
01:43:22,00 --> 01:43:26,50
As he hangs up, the women sit. 

BURLESQUE_DVS668
01:43:44,00 --> 01:43:48,50
He gives SOMEONE a brochure. 

BURLESQUE_DVS669
01:44:21,00 --> 01:44:27,50
The white-haired businessman gives a confused look. 

BURLESQUE_DVS671
01:44:25,00 --> 01:44:31,50
The lights on the lounge's archway glow onto the sidewalk. 

BURLESQUE_DVS672
01:44:28,00 --> 01:44:36,50
Inside the club, SOMEONE strolls up to SOMEONE, who sits at a table looking through a stack of paperwork. 

BURLESQUE_DVS673
01:44:33,00 --> 01:44:38,50
She takes a seat across from him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS674
01:44:57,00 --> 01:45:02,50
Smiling, she drops an envelope in front of him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS675
01:44:59,00 --> 01:45:06,50
He opens it and finds a check for $500,000. 

BURLESQUE_DVS676
01:45:04,00 --> 01:45:08,50
He stares at her with wide eyes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS677
01:45:10,00 --> 01:45:14,50
She glances skyward. 

BURLESQUE_DVS678
01:45:13,00 --> 01:45:17,50
He shakes his head at the check. 

BURLESQUE_DVS679
01:45:17,00 --> 01:45:22,50
He gives her a nod and she presses her lips to his. 

BURLESQUE_DVS680
01:45:21,00 --> 01:45:25,50
Pulling away, she eyes him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS681
01:45:25,00 --> 01:45:30,50
As she leaves, SOMEONE's lips curl into a smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS682
01:45:28,00 --> 01:45:33,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE chats with a bartender. 

BURLESQUE_DVS683
01:45:30,00 --> 01:45:35,50
SOMEONE strolls up to the bar and leans her back against it. 

BURLESQUE_DVS684
01:45:33,00 --> 01:45:38,50
SOMEONE swivels her stool to face the same direction. 

BURLESQUE_DVS685
01:45:49,00 --> 01:45:55,50
They share a grin and SOMEONE good-naturedly smacks SOMEONE's leg. 

BURLESQUE_DVS686
01:45:53,00 --> 01:45:58,50
Entering the lounge, SOMEONE spots them. 

BURLESQUE_DVS687
01:45:55,00 --> 01:46:00,50
The women's smiles fade as they notice her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS688
01:45:57,00 --> 01:46:03,50
As she approaches SOMEONE, SOMEONE turns back to the bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS689
01:46:00,00 --> 01:46:06,50
SOMEONE hangs her head, then lifts her tearful gaze. 

BURLESQUE_DVS690
01:46:17,00 --> 01:46:21,50
She gives SOMEONE an earnest look. 

BURLESQUE_DVS691
01:46:19,00 --> 01:46:24,50
The club owner replies with a gentle smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS692
01:46:23,00 --> 01:46:27,50
SOMEONE beams. 

BURLESQUE_DVS693
01:46:28,00 --> 01:46:33,50
With a nod, SOMEONE hurries off. 

BURLESQUE_DVS694
01:46:30,00 --> 01:46:34,50
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS695
01:46:40,00 --> 01:46:44,50
She puts her head on SOMEONE' shoulder. 

BURLESQUE_DVS696
01:46:48,00 --> 01:46:53,50
She hops off her stool and walks away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS697
01:46:50,00 --> 01:46:54,50
SOMEONE stares after her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS698
01:46:53,00 --> 01:47:00,50
With a serene look, she turns away and sips from a glass of dessert wine. 

BURLESQUE_DVS699
01:46:58,00 --> 01:47:04,50
SOMEONE approaches and leans beside her on the bar. 

BURLESQUE_DVS700
01:47:16,00 --> 01:47:23,50
He heads away, leaving SOMEONE at the bar with a faint smile on her lips and a faraway look. 

BURLESQUE_DVS701
01:47:22,00 --> 01:47:28,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE climbs the stairs to the dressing room. 

BURLESQUE_DVS702
01:47:25,00 --> 01:47:32,50
She sets down her bag, removes her jacket, and sits at her vanity table. 

BURLESQUE_DVS703
01:47:29,00 --> 01:47:36,50
Behind her, SOMEONE combs her hair, her eyes fixed on the blonde. 

BURLESQUE_DVS704
01:47:33,00 --> 01:47:40,50
SOMEONE lifts a brush to her eyes then spots her rival in the reflection of her mirror. 

BURLESQUE_DVS705
01:47:39,00 --> 01:47:43,50
She gives SOMEONE a cordial nod. 

BURLESQUE_DVS706
01:47:41,00 --> 01:47:47,50
With her lips pursed in a haughty expression, the diva looks away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS707
01:47:45,00 --> 01:47:52,50
The corner of SOMEONE's mouth twitches in a thoughtful smirk as she continues to watch SOMEONE in the mirror, 

BURLESQUE_DVS708
01:47:49,00 --> 01:47:54,50
then returns to her makeup. 

BURLESQUE_DVS709
01:47:54,00 --> 01:47:59,50
then lowers her gaze, her lips curling into a genial smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS710
01:47:56,00 --> 01:48:02,50
The brunette shoots her another look, 

BURLESQUE_DVS711
01:48:00,00 --> 01:48:06,50
As she stares off dreamily, another dancer reaches for her makeup. 

BURLESQUE_DVS712
01:48:07,00 --> 01:48:13,50
SOMEONE slaps her hands away, her jaw dropping in exasperation. 

BURLESQUE_DVS713
01:48:10,00 --> 01:48:17,50
SOMEONE smiles as she watches in her mirror, then touches up her mascara. 

BURLESQUE_DVS714
01:48:14,00 --> 01:48:19,50
SOMEONE appears in a doorway. 

BURLESQUE_DVS715
01:48:16,00 --> 01:48:21,50
SOMEONE lowers her mascara brush as she sees him. 

BURLESQUE_DVS716
01:48:24,00 --> 01:48:29,50
SOMEONE moves closer. 

BURLESQUE_DVS717
01:48:43,00 --> 01:48:47,50
He gives a pleading look. 

BURLESQUE_DVS718
01:48:45,00 --> 01:48:49,50
SOMEONE avoids his gaze. 

BURLESQUE_DVS719
01:48:49,00 --> 01:48:53,50
He gently lifts her chin. 

BURLESQUE_DVS720
01:48:53,00 --> 01:48:58,50
He stares into her pale-blue eyes. 

BURLESQUE_DVS721
01:49:01,00 --> 01:49:07,50
With her head tilted, SOMEONE shifts her gaze over his face. 

BURLESQUE_DVS723
01:49:05,00 --> 01:49:09,50
he opens his mouth to speak, 

BURLESQUE_DVS724
01:49:06,00 --> 01:49:10,50
then closes it again. 

BURLESQUE_DVS725
01:49:26,00 --> 01:49:31,50
His face scrunches up as he gives a charming grin. 

BURLESQUE_DVS726
01:49:30,00 --> 01:49:35,50
Glancing away, SOMEONE bites her lip. 

BURLESQUE_DVS727
01:49:49,00 --> 01:49:57,50
He leans in and they kiss. SOMEONE presses her hands to his toned chest, then wraps her arms around his neck. 

BURLESQUE_DVS728
01:49:54,00 --> 01:50:00,50
He clutches her shoulders, returning the embrace. 

BURLESQUE_DVS729
01:49:59,00 --> 01:50:06,50
They part and SOMEONE slides her hands back down his chest as he presses his lips to her 

BURLESQUE_DVS731
01:50:04,00 --> 01:50:10,50
He moves in to kiss her again, then pulls back with a smile. 

BURLESQUE_DVS732
01:50:09,00 --> 01:50:13,50
He steps away. 

BURLESQUE_DVS733
01:50:13,00 --> 01:50:17,50
He grins widely. 

BURLESQUE_DVS734
01:50:14,00 --> 01:50:19,50
Heading for the door, he pauses. 

BURLESQUE_DVS735
01:50:30,00 --> 01:50:36,50
He walks back to her and hands her some sheet music. 

BURLESQUE_DVS736
01:50:36,00 --> 01:50:42,50
The title reads, Show Me How You Burlesque, by SOMEONE. 

BURLESQUE_DVS737
01:50:39,00 --> 01:50:47,50
Now on a dark stage, a spotlight shines down on SOMEONE, who wears a sparkling outfit and her platinum wig. 

BURLESQUE_DVS738
01:51:06,00 --> 01:51:17,50
Strobe lights flash and giant block letters spelling Burlesque light up onstage. As the other dancers grind against the letters, SOMEONE sits atop the E at the center. 

BURLESQUE_DVS739
01:51:44,00 --> 01:51:49,50
More girls dance on tables in the audience. 

BURLESQUE_DVS741
01:51:55,00 --> 01:52:09,50
The dancers on the tables swing their arms and flip their hair. The stage performers mirror them. With a smile, the doorman bobs his head. SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch proudly from the balcony. Onstage, the dancers pump their chests. 

BURLESQUE_DVS742
01:52:29,00 --> 01:52:44,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE sing backup from atop the bar. More dancers strut out from the revolving mirrored panels behind them. Another girl tickles the doorman's lips and he smiles. An outline of red neon flashes around the letters onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS743
01:52:45,00 --> 01:52:52,50
The dancers on the bar fall back into the arms of the bartenders, who carry them to the stage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS744
01:52:50,00 --> 01:52:55,50
All of the girls cluster together, with SOMEONE at the center. 

BURLESQUE_DVS745
01:52:52,00 --> 01:52:58,50
They each strike a pose, coolly snapping their fingers. 

BURLESQUE_DVS746
01:53:08,00 --> 01:53:13,50
Several bartenders run onstage. 

BURLESQUE_DVS747
01:53:13,00 --> 01:53:18,50
They surround SOMEONE and grind their hips. 

BURLESQUE_DVS748
01:53:17,00 --> 01:53:22,50
The women sit on some steps in front of her. 

BURLESQUE_DVS749
01:53:26,00 --> 01:53:34,50
The male and female dancers now stand staggered on the staircase, moving in unison. 

BURLESQUE_DVS750
01:53:31,00 --> 01:53:38,50
As they shake their butts at the audience, SOMEONE imitates them and SOMEONE grins. 

BURLESQUE_DVS751
01:53:35,00 --> 01:53:41,50
The dancers hop from foot to foot, their hands beckoning the audience. 

BURLESQUE_DVS752
01:53:43,00 --> 01:53:53,50
The stage lights flash and the dancers disappear, leaving only the glowing letters. Remaining opening titles: Dianna Agron,
