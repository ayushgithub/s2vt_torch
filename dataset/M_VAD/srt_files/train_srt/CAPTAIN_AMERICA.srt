CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS18
00:02:41,00 --> 00:02:47,50
A dusting of snow covers the floor, exposed railing, and beams. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS19
00:02:45,00 --> 00:02:51,50
Slowly, the two men make their way toward the nose of the plane. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS20
00:02:48,00 --> 00:02:55,50
One man slips and staggers momentarily as he steps down a small ledge. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS21
00:02:57,00 --> 00:03:04,50
The men shine their lights on a desk-sized object covered with snow. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS22
00:03:09,00 --> 00:03:16,50
One man kneels beside the object and scrapes away a layer of frost. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS23
00:03:35,00 --> 00:03:43,50
Visible under the ice, a symbol consisting of a white star and a blue circle with a wide, red border. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS24
00:03:42,00 --> 00:03:54,50
Tonsberg, Norway, March 1942. At night, a goateed man sprints across the small town square. He hurries into a castle tower lit by torches, then bars the door. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS26
00:03:56,00 --> 00:04:00,50
They've come for it. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS27
00:03:57,00 --> 00:04:06,50
A bearded man with gray hair shuffles to meet him. They have before, not like this. Let them come. They'll never find it. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS28
00:04:03,00 --> 00:04:10,50
The two men peer around themselves as the tower trembles. A chandelier bounces on its chains. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS29
00:04:08,00 --> 00:04:12,50
The men back away from the door. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS30
00:04:11,00 --> 00:04:17,50
The front wall collapses, knocking the goateed man down. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS31
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:23,50
As the dust settles, the bearded man lifts a stone block off the goateed man who lies motionless. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS32
00:04:21,00 --> 00:04:28,50
Outside, a large tank backs up as a long, black convertible car pulls to a stop. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS33
00:04:25,00 --> 00:04:32,50
The car sports a hood ornament resembling an octopus with a human skull for a head. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS34
00:04:31,00 --> 00:04:39,50
A Nazi officer wearing shiny black boots and a dark trench coat steps out. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS35
00:04:38,00 --> 00:04:45,50
Inside the tower, helmeted German soldiers push on the lid of a large sarcophagus. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS37
00:04:51,00 --> 00:04:58,50
The soldiers stop pushing and turned to face the Nazi officer as he strides into the tower. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS38
00:05:14,00 --> 00:05:18,50
Soldiers lift the bearded man to his feet. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS39
00:05:37,00 --> 00:05:45,50
The Nazi officer removes his hat and hands it to a nearby soldier as he steps toward the sarcophagus. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS40
00:05:42,00 --> 00:05:48,50
Placing both hands on the thick stone lid, he pushes it open. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS42
00:05:49,00 --> 00:05:56,50
Inside, a skeleton grips a crystalline cube measuring about six inches per side. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS43
00:05:53,00 --> 00:05:58,50
The Nazi officer grabs the cube. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS44
00:06:02,00 --> 00:06:08,50
He turns to the bearded man and drops the cube onto the floor, shattering it. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS46
00:06:30,00 --> 00:06:38,50
The bearded man gazes toward bright light shining through the hole in the tower, then glances at a wall panel. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS47
00:06:35,00 --> 00:06:43,50
The Nazi officer turns and walks toward the wooden panel which is carved with the image of a tree. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS49
00:06:57,00 --> 00:07:03,50
A snake is curled around one of the tree's roots. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS50
00:07:01,00 --> 00:07:07,50
The Nazi officer pushes the snake's eye. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS51
00:07:06,00 --> 00:07:11,50
A box pops out of the panel. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS52
00:07:09,00 --> 00:07:14,50
The Nazi officer slides it out. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS53
00:07:11,00 --> 00:07:21,50
The bearded man's bottom lip quivers as the Nazi officer opens the box and peers inside, his face illuminated by a bright blue light. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS54
00:07:46,00 --> 00:07:51,50
The Nazi officer closes the box's lid. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS56
00:08:01,00 --> 00:08:09,50
The Nazi officer shoots the bearded man, then touches the side of his own face as he works his jaw. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS57
00:08:06,00 --> 00:08:12,50
A brooch of the tentacled skull is pinned on his lapel. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS58
00:08:10,00 --> 00:08:14,50
Elsewhere, New York City. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS59
00:08:26,00 --> 00:08:32,50
In a recruitment office, men wearing only boxer shorts sit or stand in line. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS60
00:08:31,00 --> 00:08:38,50
A short, scrawny young man with parted brown hair steps up to a doctor wearing a white coat. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS61
00:08:49,00 --> 00:08:55,50
The doctor scans Rogers' long medical file. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS62
00:09:03,00 --> 00:09:08,50
The doctor stamps the file 4F. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS63
00:09:06,00 --> 00:09:10,50
Next, wartime film footage. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS64
00:09:17,00 --> 00:09:22,50
SOMEONE sits in a crowded movie theater. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS65
00:09:46,00 --> 00:09:52,50
The boisterous movie patron stands and looms over SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS66
00:09:51,00 --> 00:09:58,50
Outside in an alley, the large man punches SOMEONE to the ground. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS67
00:09:55,00 --> 00:10:05,50
SOMEONE stands but the thug punches him again. SOMEONE holds up a trash can lid like a shield, but the large man tosses it aside and punches SOMEONE in the face. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS68
00:10:03,00 --> 00:10:09,50
Blood streaming from his mouth, SOMEONE stands and raises his fists. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS69
00:10:13,00 --> 00:10:20,50
SOMEONE takes a swing, but the man easily blocks it and punches SOMEONE into some trashcans. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS71
00:10:20,00 --> 00:10:30,50
A dark-haired man wearing an Army uniform pulls the thug away. The thug takes a swing but misses. The Army man punches the thug and kicks him down the alley. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS72
00:10:35,00 --> 00:10:40,50
The man glances at Rogers' medical form. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS73
00:10:59,00 --> 00:11:04,50
SOMEONE hangs his head. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS74
00:11:01,00 --> 00:11:07,50
SOMEONE smiles and throws one arm around his friend's shoulders. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS75
00:11:10,00 --> 00:11:19,50
SOMEONE hands SOMEONE a newspaper ad. World Exposition of Tomorrow, 1943. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS76
00:11:28,00 --> 00:11:34,50
At the World's Fair, SOMEONE waves to a pair of young women. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS77
00:11:46,00 --> 00:11:52,50
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and their dates stroll past futuristic displays. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS78
00:11:52,00 --> 00:11:57,50
They push through the crowd toward a stage. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS79
00:11:58,00 --> 00:12:12,50
Female models lean against a red car as a dark-haired mustached man in a tuxedo struts onto the stage. He hands his top hat to one of the models, then kisses her on the lips. Taking a microphone, Stark dabs his mouth with a handkerchief. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS80
00:12:22,00 --> 00:12:27,50
The models remove the car's tires. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS81
00:12:30,00 --> 00:12:38,50
As Stark operates a control panel, devices in the car's wheel wells levitate the vehicle off the ground. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS83
00:12:48,00 --> 00:12:54,50
The devices spark as the car crashes to the stage. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS84
00:12:54,00 --> 00:13:03,50
Standing in the crowd, SOMEONE glances over his shoulder. An Army recruitment poster featuring Uncle SOMEONE hangs on a column. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS86
00:13:06,00 --> 00:13:16,50
SOMEONE turns to where SOMEONE was standing but finds him gone. In a nearby recruitment booth, a man steps in front of a mirror which shows his reflected face on a body of a soldier. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS87
00:13:16,00 --> 00:13:25,50
As a woman pulls the man away, SOMEONE steps up, only his eyes and forehead are reflected above the soldier's collar. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS88
00:14:02,00 --> 00:14:09,50
A short distance away, a balding man with a goatee and glasses studies SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS89
00:14:10,00 --> 00:14:16,50
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE, then shakes his head as he backs away. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS90
00:14:22,00 --> 00:14:27,50
SOMEONE returns and the two friends hug. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS91
00:14:35,00 --> 00:14:40,50
SOMEONE salutes then walks off after the girls. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS92
00:14:43,00 --> 00:14:49,50
SOMEONE walks in the opposite direction and into the recruitment office. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS93
00:14:46,00 --> 00:14:52,50
The goateed man glances down, then follows SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS94
00:14:55,00 --> 00:15:03,50
As SOMEONE dresses in an examination room, a nurse walks in and whispers into a doctor's ear. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS95
00:15:07,00 --> 00:15:12,50
As the doctor steps out, SOMEONE glances at a sign on the wall. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS96
00:15:10,00 --> 00:15:15,50
It is illegal to falsify your enlistment form. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS97
00:15:13,00 --> 00:15:19,50
SOMEONE puts on his shoes as a military police officer walks into the room. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS98
00:15:16,00 --> 00:15:20,50
SOMEONE stares at him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS99
00:15:18,00 --> 00:15:24,50
A moment later, the goateed man steps in behind him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS100
00:15:27,00 --> 00:15:31,50
The MP leaves. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS101
00:15:45,00 --> 00:15:51,50
Dr. SOMEONE shakes Rogers' hands then opens a folder. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS102
00:17:06,00 --> 00:17:13,50
Dr. SOMEONE returns Rogers' enlistment form, now stamped 1A. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS103
00:17:10,00 --> 00:17:14,50
SOMEONE lets out a deep sigh. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS104
00:17:14,00 --> 00:17:19,50
Elsewhere in an isolated mountain range, 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS105
00:17:16,00 --> 00:17:26,50
a barred window is set into the side of a jagged mountain peak dusted with snow.  

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS107
00:17:54,00 --> 00:18:06,50
Inside, a man with round frame glasses works in a laboratory. The Nazi officer strides toward him. The Nazi officer places the box he removed from the tower onto a table. As the officer opens the box and releases bright blue light, Dr. SOMEONE puts on glasses with dark lenses. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS108
00:18:08,00 --> 00:18:18,50
The Nazi officer slides a clear canister into the box, then transfers the light source into a large machine, and locks it into place. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS109
00:18:25,00 --> 00:18:32,50
As Dr. SOMEONE operates a control panel, the machine glows with blue light. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS110
00:18:33,00 --> 00:18:38,50
Dr. SOMEONE slowly turns a dial. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS111
00:18:36,00 --> 00:18:42,50
The Nazi officer touches the side of his own face. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS112
00:18:40,00 --> 00:18:45,50
A needle on a dial creeps upward. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS113
00:18:50,00 --> 00:19:03,50
The Nazi pushes Dr. SOMEONE out of his way and cranks the dial. The machine crackles with blue energy which zips along thick wires and shimmers over another large, complex apparatus. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS114
00:19:04,00 --> 00:19:09,50
The control panel sparks and the blue energy dissipates. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS116
00:19:45,00 --> 00:19:51,50
On an Army base drill field, SOMEONE stand in a line with other recruits. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS117
00:19:50,00 --> 00:19:55,50
A brown-haired officer strides up. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS118
00:20:07,00 --> 00:20:12,50
A light-haired soldier saunters forward. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS120
00:20:18,00 --> 00:20:23,50
SOMEONE punches Hodge's face, toppling him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS121
00:20:32,00 --> 00:20:39,50
Hodge stands in formation with the other men as grey-haired Col. SOMEONE paces. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS122
00:20:46,00 --> 00:20:51,50
The colonel eyes SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS123
00:21:09,00 --> 00:21:14,50
SOMEONE falls as he climbs a cargo net. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS124
00:21:17,00 --> 00:21:25,50
As SOMEONE crawls under barbed wire during training, Hodge kicks out a post, tangling SOMEONE in the wire. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS125
00:21:33,00 --> 00:21:39,50
Later, SOMEONE lags behind the rest of his squad as they run. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS126
00:21:54,00 --> 00:22:01,50
SOMEONE watches the other soldiers fight off one another as they try to climb a flagpole. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS127
00:22:03,00 --> 00:22:09,50
Hodge climbs several feet of the pole and slides to the ground. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS128
00:22:16,00 --> 00:22:21,50
As the other men reassemble, SOMEONE walks up to the flagpole. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS129
00:22:21,00 --> 00:22:27,50
SOMEONE removes two pins at the base of the flagpole, tipping it over. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS130
00:22:26,00 --> 00:22:32,50
He walks to the flag, picks it up, and then hands it to the corporal. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS131
00:22:38,00 --> 00:22:44,50
SOMEONE climbs into the backseat of a Jeep carrying Agent SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS132
00:22:41,00 --> 00:22:49,50
She turns and smiles at him as they pull away. Later, SOMEONE oversees the men as they perform push-ups. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS133
00:22:52,00 --> 00:22:58,50
Nearby, Col. SOMEONE walks with Dr. SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS134
00:23:08,00 --> 00:23:14,50
The recruits jump to their feet and perform jumping jacks. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS135
00:23:38,00 --> 00:23:44,50
SOMEONE walks to the back of an ammo truck and picks up a grenade. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS136
00:23:44,00 --> 00:23:50,50
He pulls the pin and rolls the grenade onto the field full of recruits. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS137
00:23:49,00 --> 00:23:55,50
As the other men scatter, SOMEONE leaps onto the grenade as SOMEONE approaches him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS138
00:23:55,00 --> 00:24:03,50
He hugs the grenade to his torso as he lies in a fetal position. Slowly, SOMEONE opens his eyes and sits up. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS139
00:24:08,00 --> 00:24:14,50
SOMEONE glances toward Dr. SOMEONE who turns to the colonel. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS140
00:24:13,00 --> 00:24:17,50
Dr. SOMEONE shrugs. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS141
00:24:16,00 --> 00:24:22,50
As Col. SOMEONE walks off, Dr. SOMEONE smiles at SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS142
00:24:19,00 --> 00:24:25,50
Later, SOMEONE sits in an empty bunkhouse and reads. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS143
00:24:26,00 --> 00:24:31,50
Dr. SOMEONE walks in carrying a liquor bottle. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS144
00:24:49,00 --> 00:24:54,50
The doctor turns the bottle in his hand. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS145
00:25:38,00 --> 00:25:42,50
Nazi officer's face appears. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS146
00:26:07,00 --> 00:26:13,50
In a flashback, SOMEONE interrogates SOMEONE at gunpoint. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS147
00:26:13,00 --> 00:26:18,50
SOMEONE injects himself with a hypodermic needle. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS148
00:26:25,00 --> 00:26:30,50
Surrounded by flames, SOMEONE's face distorts as he screams. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS150
00:27:11,00 --> 00:27:16,50
Dr. SOMEONE smiles, then motions for SOMEONE to pick up a glass. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS151
00:27:13,00 --> 00:27:17,50
He fills it from his bottle. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS152
00:27:38,00 --> 00:27:44,50
SOMEONE clinks his glass against Erskine's, then lifts it to his lips. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS153
00:27:52,00 --> 00:27:57,50
Dr. SOMEONE drinks both glasses worth. SOMEONE smiles. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS154
00:27:55,00 --> 00:28:01,50
In the Hydra mountain fortress, Dr. SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE, 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS155
00:27:58,00 --> 00:28:05,50
who stands silhouetted in front of large windows. SOMEONE flips a switch on a panel. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS156
00:28:10,00 --> 00:28:16,50
Nearby, an artist stands beside a palette covered in red paints. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS157
00:28:21,00 --> 00:28:28,50
Dr. SOMEONE walks to a table and examines surveillance photos of Dr. SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS158
00:29:04,00 --> 00:29:09,50
Dr. SOMEONE turns and walks away. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS159
00:29:09,00 --> 00:29:13,50
SOMEONE stops and turns to face SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS160
00:29:13,00 --> 00:29:19,50
SOMEONE turns on bright lights behind the artist. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS161
00:29:16,00 --> 00:29:20,50
SOMEONE gazes at the man's canvass. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS162
00:29:22,00 --> 00:29:28,50
The artist gulps. Dr. SOMEONE strides out of the room. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS163
00:29:29,00 --> 00:29:36,50
Boys playing stickball on the street move aside as SOMEONE and Agent SOMEONE pass in a car. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS164
00:30:36,00 --> 00:30:43,50
SOMEONE smiles as she looks out her window. Their car pulls up to a curb. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS165
00:30:40,00 --> 00:30:45,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE step out. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS166
00:30:58,00 --> 00:31:05,50
Standing a short distance down the street, two men in suites watch SOMEONE and SOMEONE enter a shop, 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS167
00:31:02,00 --> 00:31:06,50
Brooklyn Antiques. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS168
00:31:04,00 --> 00:31:09,50
Inside, a white-haired woman steps forward to greet them. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS169
00:31:16,00 --> 00:31:23,50
The white-haired woman steps behind a counter and presses a button located beside a submachine gun. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS170
00:31:23,00 --> 00:31:30,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk into a backroom and face a bookcase which swings open, 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS171
00:31:27,00 --> 00:31:32,50
revealing a tiled hallway. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS172
00:31:33,00 --> 00:31:42,50
An MP eyes them as they walk down the hallway into a large operating theater filled with machines and electronic devices. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS173
00:31:47,00 --> 00:31:53,50
People in white lab coats turn and stare at SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS174
00:31:58,00 --> 00:32:07,50
He glances at SOMEONE who turns and leads him to Dr. SOMEONE who stands beside a padded table in the center of the room. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS175
00:32:14,00 --> 00:32:19,50
A photographer snaps their picture. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS176
00:32:17,00 --> 00:32:24,50
As the photographer walks away, SOMEONE stares at the operating table. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS177
00:32:24,00 --> 00:32:27,50
SOMEONE nods. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS178
00:32:29,00 --> 00:32:34,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE, then begins to undress. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS179
00:32:55,00 --> 00:33:04,50
As the bare-chested SOMEONE lies on the table, the senator, the colonel, and other men gaze down at him from an observation booth. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS180
00:33:40,00 --> 00:33:48,50
SOMEONE glances back at SOMEONE as she heads upstairs to the observation booth. SOMEONE meets her gaze. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS181
00:33:48,00 --> 00:33:55,50
Gazing up at the observation booth, Dr. SOMEONE taps a microphone. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS182
00:34:04,00 --> 00:34:10,50
Technicians lower clamps onto Rogers' chest. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS183
00:34:24,00 --> 00:34:33,50
Nurses load vials into panels flanking the operating table. One nurse gives SOMEONE an injection in his left arm. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS184
00:34:30,00 --> 00:34:34,50
He winces. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS185
00:34:35,00 --> 00:34:40,50
Dr. SOMEONE shrugs. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS187
00:34:52,00 --> 00:34:56,50
A technician flips a lever. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS188
00:34:54,00 --> 00:35:01,50
The vials empty as injectors pump serum into Rogers' body. He grimaces, then snaps his eyes open. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS189
00:35:04,00 --> 00:35:09,50
Standing nearby, SOMEONE Stark pulls a switch. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS190
00:35:06,00 --> 00:35:13,50
The operating table tips upright as panels close around SOMEONE, 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS191
00:35:10,00 --> 00:35:14,50
cocooning him inside a metal pod. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS192
00:35:17,00 --> 00:35:24,50
A technician plugs a hose into the pod and locks him into place. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS193
00:35:21,00 --> 00:35:27,50
Dr. SOMEONE raps his knuckles on a small window in the front of the pod. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS195
00:35:37,00 --> 00:35:43,50
Pacing in front of a long control panel, Stark turns a dial. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS196
00:35:40,00 --> 00:35:48,50
Putting on a pair of glasses with dark lenses, he grabs a metal wheel and turns it with both hands. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS197
00:35:45,00 --> 00:35:50,50
A needle rises on a Vita-Ray gauge. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS199
00:35:55,00 --> 00:36:02,50
Dr. SOMEONE shields his eyes as bright light shines out of the pod's window, filling the room. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS200
00:36:25,00 --> 00:36:31,50
Stark glances at SOMEONE and resumes turning the wheel. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS201
00:36:38,00 --> 00:36:50,50
The bright light streaming out of the pod flickers. Control panels around the operating room spark and smoke. Shielding his eyes with one hand, Dr. SOMEONE gazes at the pod as it dims, then goes dark. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS202
00:36:48,00 --> 00:36:56,50
People crowd against the windows of the observation booth. Stark lowers his protective glasses. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS203
00:37:01,00 --> 00:37:09,50
The pod slides open and reveals SOMEONE, now several inches taller and extremely muscular. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS204
00:37:09,00 --> 00:37:16,50
Dr. SOMEONE steps up and helps his groggy subject out of the apparatus. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS208
00:37:49,00 --> 00:37:56,50
Standing at the back of the room, SOMEONE watches Senator Brandt shake Dr. SOMEONE's hand. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS209
00:37:56,00 --> 00:38:02,50
SOMEONE glances toward SOMEONE as he takes out a Zippo lighter and opens it. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS210
00:38:04,00 --> 00:38:11,50
An explosion blows out the observation booth's windows, raining down glass. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS211
00:38:08,00 --> 00:38:24,50
SOMEONE grabs the last vial of serum and shoots Dr. SOMEONE in the chest. As SOMEONE flees the room, he shoots an MP. Agent SOMEONE takes out a pistol and shoots SOMEONE on the shoulder, but he escapes into the hallway and shoots another guard. SOMEONE runs after him as SOMEONE huddles over Dr. SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS216
00:38:36,00 --> 00:38:41,50
The woman's gun fires skyward as she falls. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS217
00:38:38,00 --> 00:38:45,50
SOMEONE grabs the machine gun and runs out of the shop and into the street. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS218
00:38:50,00 --> 00:39:08,50
SOMEONE dashes past a man who provides covering fire, then jumps into a waiting car. Pursuing agents shoot the gunman as SOMEONE's car speeds away. SOMEONE cuts down the agents with machine gun fire as he passes, then grabs his wounded shoulder. SOMEONE runs into the street and aims her pistol as SOMEONE flicks his lighter causing a car parked behind her to explode. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS221
00:39:10,00 --> 00:39:18,50
The bullet hits the getaway car's driver in the head causing him to crash. SOMEONE leaps out, steals a cab, and speeds back toward SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS222
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:29,50
Still standing in the middle of the street, the stern-faced SOMEONE fires her pistol into the windshield of the oncoming cab. SOMEONE leaps and tackles SOMEONE out of the street as the cab rushes past. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS223
00:39:31,00 --> 00:39:41,50
SOMEONE stands and runs after the cab. SOMEONE checks his rear-view mirror as he negotiates the bullet-ridden taxi down crowded city streets. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS224
00:39:38,00 --> 00:39:47,50
SOMEONE races up a parallel street, then tries to turn on to a main road, but instead crashes through a shop's front window. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS225
00:39:50,00 --> 00:39:54,50
SOMEONE leaps out unharmed. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS226
00:39:54,00 --> 00:40:02,50
SOMEONE runs up an alley, then leaps over a chain-link fence in a single bound. Cars swerve as he emerges in a street. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS228
00:40:03,00 --> 00:40:09,50
SOMEONE checks his rear-view mirror again as SOMEONE gains on him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS229
00:40:09,00 --> 00:40:15,50
Jerking the steering wheel, SOMEONE weaves through traffic. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS230
00:40:15,00 --> 00:40:22,50
SOMEONE leaps onto the roof of an oncoming car, then jumps from vehicle to vehicle. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS231
00:40:21,00 --> 00:40:27,50
He hurtles himself off the truck and lands face down on the roof of the taxicab. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS232
00:40:25,00 --> 00:40:33,50
SOMEONE hangs on to the top of the cab as SOMEONE swerves several times, then turns sharply down an alley. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS233
00:40:32,00 --> 00:40:40,50
SOMEONE skids onto a road running parallel to the waterfront, then fires his pistol straight up through the cab's roof. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS234
00:40:42,00 --> 00:41:09,50
Rolling from side to side, SOMEONE avoids the bullets but slips off the roof and clings to the cab's passenger side door. Taking his eyes off the road, SOMEONE fires at SOMEONE once, then slams into a passing truck. The taxi flips and rolls over several times, losing a door and spilling SOMEONE onto the roadway. SOMEONE staggers out of the crashed cab and waves his pistol at people standing by a bus. SOMEONE picks up the cab door and uses it as a shield. SOMEONE fires at him, then nabs a young boy from a woman's side. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS235
00:41:11,00 --> 00:41:15,50
A man restrains the frantic woman. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS236
00:41:16,00 --> 00:41:24,50
Carrying the boy, SOMEONE runs down an alley, then fires back at SOMEONE as he ducks behind a metal tank. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS237
00:41:25,00 --> 00:41:32,50
As SOMEONE steps around the building's corner, SOMEONE aims his pistol at the boy's head. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS238
00:41:31,00 --> 00:41:36,50
SOMEONE aims at SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS239
00:41:34,00 --> 00:41:41,50
SOMEONE tosses the boy into the river and flees. SOMEONE peers down into the water. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS240
00:41:42,00 --> 00:41:54,50
Further down river, SOMEONE takes out his lighter and flips it open. A small submarine rises out of the water. SOMEONE hops in to the single person sub and closes its canopy as the craft descends. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS241
00:41:54,00 --> 00:42:00,50
SOMEONE dives into the river and swims after the escaping submarine. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS242
00:42:06,00 --> 00:42:14,50
SOMEONE pilots the craft into deeper water, but SOMEONE catches up and punches through its glass canopy. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS243
00:42:18,00 --> 00:42:26,50
As water rushes in, SOMEONE rips off the canopy, yanks out SOMEONE, and tosses him onto the shore. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS244
00:42:28,00 --> 00:42:36,50
SOMEONE pulls out a knife and swings it at SOMEONE who kicks him on the face. The violet serum smashes on the pavement. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS245
00:42:38,00 --> 00:42:43,50
SOMEONE sucks out a fake tooth and bites down. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS246
00:42:46,00 --> 00:42:52,50
White foam bubble out of SOMEONE's mouth as he shudders, then falls still. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS247
00:42:50,00 --> 00:42:56,50
SOMEONE stares down at the dead Hydra agent, then studies his own chest and arms. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS248
00:42:59,00 --> 00:43:06,50
Later, inside the Hydra compound, SOMEONE walks with three Nazi officers. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS249
00:43:39,00 --> 00:43:45,50
SOMEONE stops and slowly turns to face the other men. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS250
00:44:02,00 --> 00:44:07,50
SOMEONE escorts the men into Dr. SOMEONE's lab. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS251
00:44:44,00 --> 00:44:48,50
One officer examines a war map. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS252
00:45:02,00 --> 00:45:07,50
SOMEONE operates a mechanical cannon. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS254
00:45:11,00 --> 00:45:21,50
The futuristic weapon vaporizes two of the officers with beams of blue light, then swivels toward the last officer as he scrambles to open a locked door. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS256
00:45:21,00 --> 00:45:27,50
The officer disintegrates in a flash of blue light. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS257
00:45:38,00 --> 00:45:45,50
As nearby guards raise both of their fists in salute, SOMEONE faces Dr. SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS258
00:45:44,00 --> 00:45:49,50
Smirking, SOMEONE strides out of the room. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS259
00:45:46,00 --> 00:45:51,50
Dr. SOMEONE sags against a wall. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS260
00:45:49,00 --> 00:45:54,50
Meanwhile, a nurse draws blood from Rogers' arm. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS261
00:46:14,00 --> 00:46:20,50
Nearby, SOMEONE Stark examines the captured Hydra submarine. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS262
00:47:16,00 --> 00:47:22,50
As Col. SOMEONE walks out, Senator Brandt steps up to SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS263
00:47:29,00 --> 00:47:35,50
A newspaper headline, Mystery Man Saves Child. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS264
00:47:56,00 --> 00:48:02,50
Later, SOMEONE stands backstage at a small theater. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS265
00:48:15,00 --> 00:48:24,50
Wearing a red, white, and blue costume and mask, SOMEONE picks up a shield decorated like the American Flag and runs onstage. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS266
00:48:25,00 --> 00:48:30,50
Smiling chorus girls march in place behind SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS267
00:48:56,00 --> 00:49:04,50
SOMEONE poses for photographs with a baby and then the senator. Later, he makes a film with American troops. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS268
00:49:03,00 --> 00:49:09,50
The chorus of marching women in short skirts joins SOMEONE on another stage. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS269
00:49:10,00 --> 00:49:20,50
The women salute as they march. Sitting in the audience, the senator gazes behind himself at the applauding crowd and nods to his assistant. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS270
00:49:49,00 --> 00:49:56,50
SOMEONE turns and pretends to punch out a Hitler impersonator sneaking up behind him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS271
00:49:53,00 --> 00:50:08,50
Children in the audience applaud as he repeats the same act for audiences in Buffalo, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Senator Brandt smiles and nods. Later, children buy comics featuring Captain America from a newsstand. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS272
00:50:05,00 --> 00:50:11,50
A GI reads a Captain America comic on his bunk. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS273
00:50:08,00 --> 00:50:27,50
In the finished movie, SOMEONE blocks bullets with his arrowhead-shaped shield, then fires a machine gun as he leads a squad of soldiers into battle. Sitting in an audience, SOMEONE grins as people around him cheer. Later, he signs an autograph for a boy backstage, then pauses as a blonde woman steps up to him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS274
00:50:30,00 --> 00:50:40,50
On a stage in New York City, SOMEONE holds a motorcycle holding three singing women over his head as a long chorus line performs high kicks in front of him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS275
00:50:56,00 --> 00:51:05,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE stands on a stage in front of a crowd of US servicemen. Italy, November 1943, five miles from the front. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS276
00:51:33,00 --> 00:51:45,50
SOMEONE glances away as one serviceman moons him. Others throw rotten fruit which he blocks with his shield. SOMEONE turns and walks off the stage as the showgirls return. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS277
00:51:53,00 --> 00:51:58,50
With his head down, SOMEONE walks off the back of the stage. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS278
00:51:57,00 --> 00:52:03,50
Later, SOMEONE sits alone on the stage and sketches himself as Captain America. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS279
00:52:02,00 --> 00:52:07,50
Agent SOMEONE walks up to him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS280
00:52:42,00 --> 00:52:48,50
SOMEONE glances over his shoulder at SOMEONE, then stares at the falling rain. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS281
00:53:11,00 --> 00:53:18,50
They both turn as a military ambulance pulls to a stop beside a medical tent. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS282
00:53:42,00 --> 00:53:46,50
SOMEONE runs after SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS283
00:54:00,00 --> 00:54:06,50
SOMEONE gazes at Agent SOMEONE, then stands and leafs through a stack of documents. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS284
00:54:14,00 --> 00:54:19,50
SOMEONE' eyes fall. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS285
00:54:44,00 --> 00:54:51,50
As Col. SOMEONE walks off, SOMEONE eyes a war map tacked to the back of the tent. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS286
00:54:53,00 --> 00:54:59,50
Agent SOMEONE watches SOMEONE stride out then stares at the map. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS287
00:55:00,00 --> 00:55:06,50
Back in his own tent, SOMEONE wears his costume as he packs a bag. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS288
00:55:18,00 --> 00:55:24,50
Putting on a brown leather jacket, SOMEONE carries his bag and shield to a parked jeep. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS289
00:55:34,00 --> 00:55:39,50
He climbs behind the wheel and starts the engine. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS290
00:55:42,00 --> 00:55:47,50
Backstage, showgirls grab helmets. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS291
00:55:47,00 --> 00:55:53,50
Wearing a helmet with the letter A on it, SOMEONE sits with SOMEONE in a plane. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS293
00:56:10,00 --> 00:56:14,50
SOMEONE taps his shield. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS294
00:56:15,00 --> 00:56:23,50
SOMEONE Starks smirks as he pilots the plane. SOMEONE glances at him, then at SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS295
00:56:39,00 --> 00:56:43,50
She hands SOMEONE a small device. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS297
00:56:46,00 --> 00:56:54,50
As anti-aircraft shells burst in the sky, SOMEONE grabs his shield and moves toward the plane door. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS298
00:57:02,00 --> 00:57:19,50
Grinning, SOMEONE lowers his goggles over his eyes and jumps out of the plane. Wide-eyed, SOMEONE stares down as explosions light the night sky, revealing an open parachute. The airplane banks sharply and soars out of the area. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS300
00:57:46,00 --> 00:57:51,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE and SOMEONE tour a bustling Hydra factory. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS301
00:57:49,00 --> 00:57:56,50
A man holding a clipboard steps up to SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS302
00:57:53,00 --> 00:58:02,50
On the factory floor, workers assemble mechanical parts with glowing blue components. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS303
00:58:00,00 --> 00:58:06,50
Meanwhile, Hydra guards lead prisoners into a cell. One guard knocks off a mustached man's bowler hat with a nightstick. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS304
00:58:10,00 --> 00:58:15,50
The burly prisoner turns to the guard as he puts his hat back on. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS305
00:58:17,00 --> 00:58:27,50
The guard closes the cell door and leaves. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS306
00:58:27,00 --> 00:58:33,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE jogs through a foggy forest to the edge of a clearing where searchlights sweep the perimeter of a tall barbed wire fence. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS307
00:58:34,00 --> 00:58:41,50
SOMEONE ducks as a convoy of vehicles passes nearby. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS308
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:43,50
He runs and leaps into the back of the last transport truck where inside, two masked 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS309
00:58:44,00 --> 00:58:55,50
Hydra soldiers turn to face him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS310
00:58:59,00 --> 00:59:08,50
The canvas tarp covering the back of the truck bulges repeatedly. The bodies of the two soldiers flop out onto the road as the truck follows the rest of the convoy into the fenced compound. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS311
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:21,50
The truck backs up to a loading dock where an armed soldier lifts the tarp and peers inside to face the Captain America shield. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS312
00:59:25,00 --> 00:59:33,50
The shield bashes the guard in the faces, knocking him backward. SOMEONE hops on to the dock, then runs and hides amid several parked vehicles marked with the Hydra symbol. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS313
00:59:30,00 --> 00:59:37,50
He dashes across the yard and scurries up one of the armored vehicles, then climbs onto the roof of a low building. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS314
00:59:35,00 --> 00:59:42,50
He runs along the roof toward another massive building beyond sweeping searchlights. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS315
00:59:45,00 --> 00:59:50,50
Later, inside the facility, SOMEONE' silhouette fills a small window on a door. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS316
00:59:52,00 --> 00:59:59,50
A nearby guard opens the door and peeks out. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS317
00:59:57,00 --> 01:00:05,50
SOMEONE knocks the guard unconscious and drags out his body, then closes the door behind himself as he enters. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS318
01:00:13,00 --> 01:00:24,50
Hiding amid large mechanical parts, SOMEONE draws a pistol as he creeps around the factory's main floor. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS319
01:00:22,00 --> 01:00:30,50
He examines a chest-high cylindrical object studded with glowing blue components, then grabs a small device about the size of a cigarette lighter and slips it into his pants pocket. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS320
01:00:32,00 --> 01:00:40,50
In the darkened prisoners ward, a guard paces along a catwalk above circular jail cells. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS321
01:00:40,00 --> 01:00:46,50
Men seating in one cell glance upward as a guard's limp body falls onto the barred opening above them. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS322
01:00:53,00 --> 01:01:00,50
The prisoners stand as SOMEONE frisks the guard's body and takes his keys. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS323
01:01:19,00 --> 01:01:34,50
SOMEONE unlocks the cell doors and releases prisoners including an Asian man. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS324
01:01:31,00 --> 01:01:38,50
Dugan, the mustached man with the bowler, glances at his companions as SOMEONE runs off. Later, the escaping men rush into the yard, clobbering guards and stealing their weapons. One Hydra soldier shoots several prisoners before being tackled to the ground. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS325
01:01:35,00 --> 01:01:45,50
Flashes of blue light streak across the yard as Dugan climbs atop one of the armored vehicles. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS326
01:01:46,00 --> 01:01:52,50
SOMEONE, the Asian-American GI, snaps a guard's neck as Dernier, a balding man with a dark mustache, picks up a Hydra blaster rifle. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS327
01:01:52,00 --> 01:01:57,50
Dernier fire the blaster, exploding a huge hole in a building wall. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS328
01:01:55,00 --> 01:02:00,50
SOMEONE watches the breakout on a monitor, 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS329
01:02:00,00 --> 01:02:08,50
then presses a button on a control panel. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS331
01:02:18,00 --> 01:02:24,50
Out in the yard, SOMEONE, an African-American GI, drops beside Dugan inside the armored vehicle. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS332
01:02:23,00 --> 01:02:31,50
Dugan drives forward as a gunner fires a blaster mounted on the top of the armored vehicle. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS333
01:02:28,00 --> 01:02:38,50
Inside the facility, escaped prisoners fire on a group of guards as explosions rip through the compound. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS334
01:02:38,00 --> 01:02:44,50
SOMEONE views the chaos on the monitor. He rotates a security camera and watches SOMEONE as he fights his way past several Hydra soldiers. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS335
01:02:54,00 --> 01:03:02,50
SOMEONE flips several switches, activating timers which count down from seven minutes. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS336
01:03:00,00 --> 01:03:11,50
SOMEONE gestures toward the monitor. Dr. SOMEONE gapes as he watches SOMEONE bash a guard with his shield. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS338
01:03:10,00 --> 01:03:20,50
SOMEONE runs out of the control room and onto a catwalk. On another catwalk above the factory floor, SOMEONE kicks a guard on the chest, knocking him over a railing. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS341
01:03:22,00 --> 01:03:39,50
SOMEONE scans his surroundings, then pulls out his pistol as he continues on. Outside, escaped prisoners shoot down several Hydra soldiers. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS342
01:03:39,00 --> 01:03:47,50
SOMEONE grabs a grenade from an open crate and hurls it into enemy ranks, exploding several Hydra soldiers. In the control room, SOMEONE picks up a clear canister containing the glowing blue energy source as the timers continue to countdown. In an office, Dr. SOMEONE stuffs documents into a case. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS343
01:03:44,00 --> 01:03:51,50
He runs into the hallway where SOMEONE stands at its far end. SOMEONE turns and flees in the opposite direction. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS344
01:03:52,00 --> 01:03:58,50
SOMEONE chases after him, then slows and turns into another room. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS345
01:04:09,00 --> 01:04:14,50
SOMEONE rushes up to SOMEONE who lies on a padded table. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS347
01:04:19,00 --> 01:04:24,50
SOMEONE rips off leather restraints. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS348
01:04:27,00 --> 01:04:35,50
SOMEONE helps the shorter SOMEONE to his feet. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS349
01:04:36,00 --> 01:04:41,50
SOMEONE glances over one shoulder, then gazes at a wall map of Europe with several small flags pinned to it. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS350
01:04:41,00 --> 01:04:49,50
SOMEONE leans on SOMEONE as he limps out of the room. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS351
01:04:52,00 --> 01:05:01,50
Outside, several prisoners follow alongside the stolen armored vehicle as it blasts through the front gate. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS352
01:05:03,00 --> 01:05:10,50
The armored vehicle rolls through the flaming gate, escaped prisoners run out behind it. In the control room, one of the timers reaches zero. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS353
01:05:10,00 --> 01:05:17,50
Massive explosions tear through the factory, destroying the half-built equipment. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS354
01:05:14,00 --> 01:05:21,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE run onto a catwalk above the fiery factory floor. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS355
01:05:18,00 --> 01:05:25,50
They retreat from the flames, dashing upstairs, and running onto an upper catwalk. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS358
01:05:29,00 --> 01:05:34,50
A short distance away, SOMEONE and Dr. SOMEONE emerge from a doorway. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS359
01:05:41,00 --> 01:05:45,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE approach one another. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS360
01:05:45,00 --> 01:05:50,50
SOMEONE punches SOMEONE in the face. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS361
01:05:49,00 --> 01:05:55,50
Rubbing his jaw, SOMEONE straightens. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS362
01:05:52,00 --> 01:05:58,50
SOMEONE punches back, denting SOMEONE' shield. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS363
01:05:55,00 --> 01:06:05,50
SOMEONE loses his pistol as a second punch knocks him down. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS364
01:06:11,00 --> 01:06:23,50
He kicks SOMEONE in the chest, throwing him several feet backward. Dr. SOMEONE pulls a lever and the catwalk slides apart, leaving SOMEONE and SOMEONE on opposite sides. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS365
01:06:38,00 --> 01:06:44,50
SOMEONE reaches one hand under his own chin. SOMEONE stares open-mouthed as SOMEONE peels off his face, actually a mask, and reveals his true face, a ghoulish red skull. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS366
01:06:47,00 --> 01:07:00,50
SOMEONE tosses the mask into the flames below. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS368
01:07:01,00 --> 01:07:06,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE step into an elevator and escape. As the flames rise higher, SOMEONE gazes around the factory. A light flashes above an exit door at the end of the uppermost catwalk. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS369
01:07:07,00 --> 01:07:11,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE run up the staircase. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS370
01:07:08,00 --> 01:07:13,50
SOMEONE nods. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS371
01:07:17,00 --> 01:07:24,50
The elevator opens revealing a single-person aircraft. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS372
01:07:22,00 --> 01:07:34,50
Handing SOMEONE a set of keys, SOMEONE walks toward the aircraft as the elevator closes. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS373
01:07:32,00 --> 01:07:39,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE and SOMEONE reach the upper catwalk. The exit is on the other side of a chasm spanned by a thin metal beam. On the ground floor, Dr. SOMEONE hops into SOMEONE's black convertible town car. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS374
01:07:36,00 --> 01:07:43,50
On the roof, a bridge slides away from the aircraft which is shaped like an upright torpedo. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS375
01:07:40,00 --> 01:07:48,50
Rockets spin three large fins like a fan, propelling the craft into the sky. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS376
01:07:52,00 --> 01:07:58,50
Dr. SOMEONE speeds out of the facility in the car as more explosions tear through the compound. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS377
01:07:55,00 --> 01:08:00,50
SOMEONE steps onto the beam and inches his way across. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS378
01:08:01,00 --> 01:08:07,50
Explosions bellow up from the floor below. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS379
01:08:08,00 --> 01:08:19,50
The beam shakes and its far end detaches from the wall. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS380
01:08:26,00 --> 01:08:32,50
SOMEONE runs and leaps, grabbing on to the far railing just before the beam falls. He pulls himself up onto the catwalk and looks back at SOMEONE on the opposite side. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS381
01:08:32,00 --> 01:08:39,50
SOMEONE bends back the broken railing on his side, creating a gap. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS382
01:08:39,00 --> 01:08:46,50
He takes several steps backward, sighs, then races forward and leaps off the catwalk. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS383
01:08:45,00 --> 01:08:51,50
Flames bloom upward and engulf SOMEONE as he sails across the chasm. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS384
01:09:07,00 --> 01:09:12,50
Back at the base, Col. SOMEONE reads dictation to a typist. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS385
01:09:55,00 --> 01:10:02,50
Agent SOMEONE walks into Phillips' tent. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS386
01:10:07,00 --> 01:10:17,50
SOMEONE follows SOMEONE out of the tent as they joined soldiers rushing to a gate at the end of the dirt road. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS387
01:10:38,00 --> 01:10:45,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE march toward them at the head of the group of freed prisoners, now outfitted with stolen Hydra weapons and several armored vehicles. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS388
01:10:55,00 --> 01:11:02,50
SOMEONE smiles at SOMEONE as they walk past lines of cheering soldiers. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS389
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:25,50
Col. SOMEONE stalks through the crowd and approaches SOMEONE who salutes him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS390
01:11:24,00 --> 01:11:29,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS391
01:11:32,00 --> 01:11:37,50
She steps up to SOMEONE as the colonel walks off. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS392
01:11:38,00 --> 01:11:42,50
SOMEONE takes the broken transceiver out of his pocket. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS393
01:11:47,00 --> 01:11:55,50
SOMEONE offers a slight smile. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS394
01:11:57,00 --> 01:12:03,50
Still smiling, SOMEONE locks her eyes on SOMEONE as he gazes at the faces of the cheering soldiers all around him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS395
01:12:07,00 --> 01:12:12,50
Later at a press conference, Senator Brandt stands at a podium. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS396
01:12:14,00 --> 01:12:20,50
Brandt gestures toward an empty doorway. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS397
01:12:21,00 --> 01:12:32,50
A senator's aide steps out and whispers into the senator's ear. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS398
01:12:29,00 --> 01:12:35,50
Big SOMEONE looms over a city street as barrage balloons float overhead. A Daily Mail billboard reads, Captain America To Receive Medal For Valor. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS399
01:12:44,00 --> 01:12:48,50
In a bunker filled with military personnel, SOMEONE marks a map. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS400
01:12:50,00 --> 01:12:56,50
An officer takes the map. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS401
01:13:20,00 --> 01:13:25,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE join Col. SOMEONE at another map marked with tiny flags. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS402
01:13:34,00 --> 01:13:40,50
Later, SOMEONE drinks with the rescued men. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS403
01:13:43,00 --> 01:13:49,50
Dernier addresses SOMEONE, then converses with SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS404
01:13:47,00 --> 01:13:52,50
SOMEONE shakes Dernier's hand and turns to the others. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS405
01:13:53,00 --> 01:13:58,50
Dugan raises his glass of beer. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS406
01:13:56,00 --> 01:14:01,50
Dugan chugs a beer and slams down his empty mug. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS407
01:14:04,00 --> 01:14:10,50
Grinning, SOMEONE takes the men's empty mugs to the bar. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS408
01:14:27,00 --> 01:14:32,50
SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE who sits alone at the bar. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS409
01:14:33,00 --> 01:14:38,50
SOMEONE sips liquor from a tumbler. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS410
01:14:39,00 --> 01:14:44,50
A Captain America poster hangs nearby. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS411
01:14:45,00 --> 01:14:51,50
At the table, Dugan and the other men sing. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS412
01:15:00,00 --> 01:15:04,50
They stop and stare as SOMEONE, wearing a long, dark dress, enters the bar. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS413
01:15:17,00 --> 01:15:21,50
SOMEONE glances over at the drinking men. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS414
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:26,50
SOMEONE smiles at SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS415
01:15:34,00 --> 01:15:40,50
She walks off. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS416
01:15:45,00 --> 01:15:50,50
In a lab, Stark examines a glowing blue pellet. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS417
01:15:52,00 --> 01:16:04,50
An engineer smiles as he takes notes. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS418
01:16:03,00 --> 01:16:08,50
Shielded behind a blast screen, Stark uses mechanical claws to touch a wire to the glowing pellet. An explosion inside the chamber blows out the glass and sends Stark and the engineer flying backward across the room. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS419
01:16:09,00 --> 01:16:16,50
At headquarters, SOMEONE approaches a blonde woman reading a newspaper. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS420
01:16:17,00 --> 01:16:25,50
SOMEONE nods and stands with his hands behind his back. The woman looks up from her paper and smiles at him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS421
01:16:36,00 --> 01:16:43,50
As SOMEONE leans against the table, the woman holds up her newspaper, 400 Prisoners Liberated. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS422
01:16:47,00 --> 01:16:53,50
The secretary flexes the foot of her crossed-leg as she eyes SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS423
01:17:00,00 --> 01:17:05,50
The woman sashays to SOMEONE who folds his arms and glances away. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS424
01:17:04,00 --> 01:17:09,50
She grabs his tie and pulls him behind a bookcase. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS425
01:17:06,00 --> 01:17:14,50
She pulls him closer and kisses him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS426
01:17:17,00 --> 01:17:21,50
SOMEONE walks up behind them. SOMEONE stares with her hands on her hips as the woman reaches her arms around SOMEONE' neck. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS427
01:17:35,00 --> 01:17:41,50
SOMEONE runs after SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS428
01:17:42,00 --> 01:17:46,50
SOMEONE stops and stares at SOMEONE, and rolls her eyes, and continues on. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS430
01:18:14,00 --> 01:18:18,50
Later, SOMEONE meets with Stark. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS431
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:25,50
Stark points to several modified shields. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS432
01:18:30,00 --> 01:18:35,50
A round shield. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS433
01:18:42,00 --> 01:18:49,50
SOMEONE slips the concave shield onto his left arm. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS435
01:18:50,00 --> 01:18:55,50
Smiling, SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. She picks up a handgun and fires at the shield. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS436
01:18:55,00 --> 01:19:04,50
She lowers the gun and smiles. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS437
01:19:08,00 --> 01:19:24,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE icily as she walks out. Stark walks over. SOMEONE pulls a piece of paper from his pocket and hands it to him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS438
01:19:21,00 --> 01:19:26,50
Later, wearing a new Captain America uniform and mask, SOMEONE picks up the round shield painted with a white star inside a blue circle surrounded by red and white bands. SOMEONE hold the shield in front of himself as he and his squad members barge into a factory, firing their weapons. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS439
01:19:25,00 --> 01:19:42,50
SOMEONE smacks several Hydra soldiers with the shield. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS440
01:19:40,00 --> 01:19:46,50
As his fellow soldiers run outside, SOMEONE flies out of the exploding building on a motorcycle. Approaching in his long, black convertible, SOMEONE stops and grimaces as he watches the Hydra factory burn. In the strategy room, an assistant uses a long stick to remove a flag from the war map and pass it to SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS441
01:19:43,00 --> 01:19:52,50
In a snowy forest, SOMEONE walks ahead of his men. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS443
01:19:56,00 --> 01:20:04,50
He glances back and motions for them to follow. SOMEONE moves ahead into a small clearing, then turns and hurls the shield into a treetop. The shield strikes a hidden Hydra soldier. As the man falls out of the tree, the shield boomerangs back into SOMEONE' hand. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS444
01:20:01,00 --> 01:20:08,50
Later, SOMEONE and his team run through the forest while bombs explode around them. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS446
01:20:09,00 --> 01:20:19,50
SOMEONE signals as a Hydra tank approaches on a forest road. Dernier runs onto the road, rolls underneath the armored vehicle, and places a detonator on its frame. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS447
01:20:17,00 --> 01:20:22,50
Dernier stands and plugs his ears as the tank rolls on. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS448
01:20:22,00 --> 01:20:26,50
Dugan smiles. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS449
01:20:25,00 --> 01:20:40,50
In a small movie theater, SOMEONE sits and watches a film of SOMEONE and his men riding in the back of a truck. Studying a map, SOMEONE holds a compass with a picture of her inside the lid. Sitting in the seat beside SOMEONE, Col. SOMEONE glances at her and smiles. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS450
01:20:37,00 --> 01:20:45,50
Outside another destroyed factory, a Hydra guard aims a gun at SOMEONE but SOMEONE shoots the guard first. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS451
01:20:45,00 --> 01:20:50,50
SOMEONE looks up at SOMEONE and salutes him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS452
01:20:47,00 --> 01:21:01,50
In the strategy room, SOMEONE removes another flag from a wall map. Outside a Hydra facility, SOMEONE leaps on to the top of a large armored tank and slices the hatch open with his shield. SOMEONE pulls out the masked driver and hurls him through the air. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS453
01:21:02,00 --> 01:21:14,50
A squad member tosses SOMEONE a bomb which he throws into the tank. SOMEONE jumps off as it explodes. Later, outside the ruins of a Hydra factory, SOMEONE scowls at Dr. SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS454
01:21:36,00 --> 01:21:41,50
Hydra guards bring over a dark-haired factory manager. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS455
01:21:43,00 --> 01:21:48,50
SOMEONE points a blaster gun at the man. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS456
01:21:48,00 --> 01:21:52,50
SOMEONE fires. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS457
01:21:50,00 --> 01:22:03,50
Elsewhere, atop a snow-covered mountain, a mustached Falsworth peers through binoculars. While SOMEONE and SOMEONE work a radio, SOMEONE and SOMEONE stand under a cable stretching down to distant train tracks. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS458
01:22:19,00 --> 01:22:27,50
SOMEONE puts on his helmet. With the binoculars, Falsworth watches a train speed across a distant trestle. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS459
01:22:36,00 --> 01:22:41,50
SOMEONE grabs a handle attached to the cable. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS460
01:22:39,00 --> 01:22:44,50
SOMEONE slides down the cable toward the tracks. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS461
01:22:43,00 --> 01:22:52,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE grab handles and slide down the cable. They glide over the train as it speeds beneath them along the snow-covered track. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS462
01:22:51,00 --> 01:22:57,50
One by one, they let go of the handles and land on top of the train. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS463
01:22:59,00 --> 01:23:05,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE follow SOMEONE over several train cars to a ladder. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS464
01:23:08,00 --> 01:23:15,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE climb down the ladder and enter a compartment while SOMEONE stands guard atop the train. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS465
01:23:18,00 --> 01:23:23,50
SOMEONE follows SOMEONE as he moves through the empty compartment. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS466
01:23:26,00 --> 01:23:33,50
SOMEONE glances back at SOMEONE, then moves across a hallway into a connecting compartment. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS467
01:23:30,00 --> 01:23:36,50
As SOMEONE approaches the hallway, doors slide shut. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS468
01:23:37,00 --> 01:23:47,50
A Hydra trooper wearing an armored suit and helmet enters SOMEONE' compartment and opens fire with a blaster. SOMEONE watches the action on a monitor. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS474
01:24:15,00 --> 01:24:22,50
SOMEONE watches the monitor as SOMEONE and SOMEONE fight the Hydra soldiers. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS475
01:24:19,00 --> 01:24:26,50
In his compartment, SOMEONE leans out from behind the crates and returns fire with a pistol. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS481
01:24:49,00 --> 01:24:59,50
SOMEONE picks up a shield as the trooper fires. SOMEONE drops the shield as he flies backward out of the train. SOMEONE grabs the shield and hurls it into the trooper. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS482
01:24:57,00 --> 01:25:04,50
SOMEONE leans out of the train, clinging to the side. SOMEONE dangles over a deep canyon. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS483
01:25:02,00 --> 01:25:08,50
SOMEONE climbs outside the train and reaches for SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS486
01:25:07,00 --> 01:25:13,50
The metal bar SOMEONE clings to breaks and he plummets into the canyon. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS487
01:25:13,00 --> 01:25:19,50
SOMEONE stares downward and closes his eyes. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS488
01:25:21,00 --> 01:25:29,50
As the train enters a tunnel, SOMEONE crashes through the engine room ceiling and points his machine gun at Dr. SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS489
01:25:31,00 --> 01:25:39,50
Inside the Allied headquarters, a guard ushers SOMEONE into an interrogation room and hands him his eyeglasses. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS490
01:25:40,00 --> 01:25:45,50
As the guard leaves, SOMEONE puts on his glasses. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS491
01:25:45,00 --> 01:25:50,50
Dr. SOMEONE glances around as he walks across the room. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS492
01:25:50,00 --> 01:25:58,50
In one corner stands an examination table on wheels. Dried blood stains the floor beneath the table. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS493
01:25:58,00 --> 01:26:05,50
Dr. SOMEONE flinches as Col. SOMEONE enters the room carrying a food tray. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS494
01:26:12,00 --> 01:26:18,50
As he places the tray on a table, SOMEONE sits. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS495
01:26:26,00 --> 01:26:30,50
SOMEONE sits across from SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS496
01:26:45,00 --> 01:26:50,50
SOMEONE picks up utensils and cuts the steak. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS497
01:27:00,00 --> 01:27:04,50
SOMEONE takes a bite of the steak. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS498
01:27:08,00 --> 01:27:14,50
SOMEONE pushes a document to SOMEONE who reads it. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS499
01:28:24,00 --> 01:28:31,50
At a Hydra airfield, SOMEONE approaches a stool bearing  a bottle of white wine and a glass. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS500
01:28:29,00 --> 01:28:37,50
Standing beneath the wing of a huge airplane, he addresses a small group of masked pilots. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS501
01:28:34,00 --> 01:28:40,50
Behind him, thousands more stand in formation. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS502
01:29:03,00 --> 01:29:08,50
SOMEONE lifts a glass of wine. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS503
01:29:17,00 --> 01:29:25,50
SOMEONE drinks, then raises his glass toward the pilots as they pump both of their fists in the air. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS504
01:29:26,00 --> 01:29:34,50
Elsewhere at night, SOMEONE steps over rubble and SOMEONE as she walks through a bombed out pub. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS505
01:29:46,00 --> 01:29:53,50
SOMEONE steps through a doorway and finds SOMEONE drinking whiskey at a table near the bar. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS506
01:29:51,00 --> 01:29:56,50
He glances at her, then pours another shot. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS507
01:30:24,00 --> 01:30:29,50
SOMEONE sits across from SOMEONE who stares downward. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS508
01:31:24,00 --> 01:31:30,50
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, Stark, SOMEONE, and others sit around a table at Allied headquarters. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS509
01:31:38,00 --> 01:31:44,50
SOMEONE throws photographs of mountains in front of SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS510
01:31:46,00 --> 01:31:52,50
Everyone turns to SOMEONE who gazes ahead with a furrowed brow. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS511
01:31:54,00 --> 01:32:01,50
In a forest, SOMEONE kick-starts an armored motorcycle and speeds along a dirt road. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS512
01:32:03,00 --> 01:32:09,50
Several Hydra troopers on motorcycles drive onto the road behind him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS513
01:32:11,00 --> 01:32:21,50
The troopers shoot blasters at SOMEONE as they speed closer. SOMEONE fires hooks attached to a cable into trees on either side of the road. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS514
01:32:23,00 --> 01:32:44,50
The troopers in front duck, but two troopers in the back strike the cable and fly off their bikes. SOMEONE pushes a button and flames shoot out of his tailpipe, setting a pursuing trooper on fire. Another trooper crashes into the burning wreck and sails off his bike. A pair of additional troopers merge onto the road in front of SOMEONE. He speeds up and pulls the pin out of one of their as he passes. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS515
01:32:46,00 --> 01:33:01,50
Both motorcycles explode. Approaching the Hydra base, SOMEONE mounts his shield on the front of his motorcycle. A cannon blaster fires bolts of energy which strike the ground and trees around him. An armored vehicle rolls out of the base's fortified entrance. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS516
01:32:59,00 --> 01:33:04,50
SOMEONE pushes a button, firing missiles which destroy the tank. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS517
01:33:02,00 --> 01:33:08,50
He speeds up a sloped rampart and lands inside the base. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS518
01:33:05,00 --> 01:33:10,50
Troopers fire at him with blasters. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS519
01:33:07,00 --> 01:33:14,50
Grabbing his shield, SOMEONE leaps off the moving motorcycle and tackles a trooper. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS520
01:33:11,00 --> 01:33:19,50
He hurls his shield at another as his motorcycle coasts into a wall and explodes. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS522
01:33:20,00 --> 01:33:35,50
SOMEONE fights off troopers as they charge toward him. He kicks one on the chest and slams another with his shield. As more Hydra soldiers converge on him, SOMEONE throws his shield which bounces off an armored vehicle and knocks a trooper in the head. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS523
01:33:32,00 --> 01:33:40,50
SOMEONE tosses another soldier into the air, then catches his shield as it boomerangs back to him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS524
01:33:37,00 --> 01:33:48,50
A pair of heavy troopers with arm-mounted flamethrowers arrive and enclosed SOMEONE in walls of fire. As the flames die, dozens of Hydra soldiers surround SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS525
01:33:48,00 --> 01:33:55,50
Later, troopers lead SOMEONE, now handcuffed, into a large room inside the base. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS526
01:33:52,00 --> 01:33:56,50
SOMEONE steps up to him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS527
01:34:39,00 --> 01:34:44,50
SOMEONE smiles and shakes his head. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS528
01:34:47,00 --> 01:34:53,50
SOMEONE punches SOMEONE, backhands him, and jabs him in the chest. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS529
01:34:51,00 --> 01:34:58,50
SOMEONE falls to his knees. His chest heaves as he gazes up at SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS531
01:35:05,00 --> 01:35:14,50
SOMEONE pulls out a blue energy pistol. Outside, grappling hooks and cables shoot into the mountainside above the barred window. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS532
01:35:12,00 --> 01:35:27,50
SOMEONE pulls a trooper in front of himself as SOMEONE fires, incinerating the trooper. Sliding in on the cables, Falsworth, Dugan, and SOMEONE burst through window and fire weapons while SOMEONE flees down a long corridor. Falsworth tosses SOMEONE his shield. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS535
01:35:29,00 --> 01:35:36,50
SOMEONE runs down the corridor as dozens of armed Hydra troops run after him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS536
01:35:33,00 --> 01:35:41,50
In another corridor, metal doors blow apart in a burst of flames. SOMEONE and Dernier enter. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS538
01:35:44,00 --> 01:35:55,50
In the forest, SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE and his men rush toward the base. Inside, Allied soldiers and Hydra troopers exchange fire. More US soldiers emerge from the forest. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS540
01:35:54,00 --> 01:36:06,50
SOMEONE carries a machine gun as she runs alongside the advancing soldiers. Hydra guards and troopers fire blaster weapons, incinerating some soldiers as they approach the base. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS542
01:36:04,00 --> 01:36:19,50
A bullet takes out a Hydra trooper kneeling beside an armored vehicle. Other troopers fall back toward the base as they fire at approaching soldier. Phillips' men explode armored vehicles, killing nearby troopers and clearing a path into the base. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS544
01:36:19,00 --> 01:36:24,50
Flames engulf the entrance to a corridor. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS545
01:36:21,00 --> 01:36:29,50
As Allied soldiers pour in, SOMEONE picks up a blaster and incinerates several of them before running off. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS546
01:36:26,00 --> 01:36:33,50
A Hydra trooper charges toward the entering soldiers with his blaster raised. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS548
01:36:37,00 --> 01:36:41,50
SOMEONE shoots the trooper. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS549
01:36:40,00 --> 01:36:46,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE chases SOMEONE while deflecting blasts with his shield. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS550
01:36:43,00 --> 01:36:59,50
SOMEONE dashes between two closing doors. SOMEONE throws a shield which wedges between the doors. A Hydra trooper appears and shoots flamethrowers at SOMEONE who ducks into a doorway to avoid the streams of fire. SOMEONE approaches from a connecting corridor and shoots her machine gun. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS553
01:37:00,00 --> 01:37:06,50
The trooper's armored suit explodes as he falls dead. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS554
01:37:03,00 --> 01:37:08,50
SOMEONE runs up to SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS555
01:37:08,00 --> 01:37:12,50
He steps closer to her. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS556
01:37:13,00 --> 01:37:20,50
SOMEONE runs to his shield and pulls it free, then dashes through the doors as they close. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS557
01:37:19,00 --> 01:37:28,50
In a huge hangar, SOMEONE climbs up a ladder into a bomber plane. Allied soldiers shoot three Hydra troopers trying to climb up behind him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS558
01:37:27,00 --> 01:37:37,50
In the cockpit, SOMEONE inserts the canister containing the blue energy source into a large mechanism, then climbs into the pilot's seat. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS559
01:37:36,00 --> 01:37:46,50
He turns on the cockpit control panel. On a display screen, an image of North America appears with a blinking bull's-eye over New York City. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS560
01:37:47,00 --> 01:38:04,50
Propellers lining the back of the boomerang-shaped bomber spin to life as the plane fires twin thrusters and rolls down the hangar's runway. SOMEONE runs into the hangar and glances around at the battling Hydra troopers and Allied soldiers. He sprints through the fray, knocking troopers down with his shield. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS561
01:38:01,00 --> 01:38:08,50
SOMEONE leaps and grabs a cable, then swing over the heads of the battling soldiers. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS562
01:38:09,00 --> 01:38:15,50
He lands on the runway and chases after the plane. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS563
01:38:15,00 --> 01:38:20,50
The plane pulls ahead. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS564
01:38:19,00 --> 01:38:26,50
As SOMEONE stops, SOMEONE and SOMEONE pull up in SOMEONE's convertible. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS565
01:38:27,00 --> 01:38:41,50
SOMEONE hops into the passenger seat and SOMEONE drives off after the plane. In the cockpit, SOMEONE watches the car approach on a monitor. As he slides a lever forward, the plane accelerates toward the hangar exit. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS566
01:38:38,00 --> 01:38:44,50
Driving the car, SOMEONE glances down and pushes a button on the dashboard. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS567
01:38:41,00 --> 01:38:47,50
Flames shoot out of the back of the car as it shoots forward. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS568
01:38:49,00 --> 01:38:56,50
As the car pulls closer to the plane, SOMEONE stands and glances at SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS569
01:38:59,00 --> 01:39:04,50
SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE, pulls him close, and kisses him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS570
01:39:05,00 --> 01:39:09,50
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS571
01:39:08,00 --> 01:39:16,50
SOMEONE puts the shield on his back and climbs onto the hood of the car as SOMEONE maneuvers underneath the plane. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS572
01:39:13,00 --> 01:39:18,50
Propeller blades strike SOMEONE' shield. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS573
01:39:18,00 --> 01:39:26,50
SOMEONE drives past the propellers. SOMEONE stands, then leaps onto the plane's back wheel mount as the bomber takes off. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS575
01:39:29,00 --> 01:39:39,50
SOMEONE turns the steering wheel and stomps on the brake pedal. The car skids sideways out of the hangar, slides backward, and stops at the edge of a cliff. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS576
01:39:41,00 --> 01:39:48,50
SOMEONE stands and gazes up at SOMEONE clinging to the rising bomber. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS577
01:39:50,00 --> 01:40:02,50
SOMEONE climbs up into the hold as the wheels retract. He hops onto a railed catwalk between two bombs with small cockpits and propellers labelled Chicago and New York. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS578
01:40:11,00 --> 01:40:17,50
Several Hydra troopers enter the hold and run along the catwalk. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS579
01:40:20,00 --> 01:40:27,50
SOMEONE jumps down and kicks the last trooper over the railing as he passes. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS583
01:40:47,00 --> 01:40:54,50
The trooper falls. SOMEONE fights off two more troopers, hurling one of them through the open bay. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS584
01:40:54,00 --> 01:41:01,50
A trooper climbs into one of the flying bombs as bay doors beneath it open. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS585
01:40:58,00 --> 01:41:07,50
SOMEONE leaps on to the bomb and raises his shield, but a trooper dives onto SOMEONE from behind, knocking his shield to the floor. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS586
01:41:04,00 --> 01:41:11,50
The bomb drops out of the plane with SOMEONE and the other trooper clinging to its canopy. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS587
01:41:08,00 --> 01:41:14,50
The flying bomb's wings unfold and a rear propeller spins. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS588
01:41:12,00 --> 01:41:18,50
The pilot tilts the flying bomb left and right, then dives straight down. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS589
01:41:15,00 --> 01:41:21,50
SOMEONE and the trooper slide around atop the canopy. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS590
01:41:18,00 --> 01:41:24,50
Pulling back on the joystick, the pilot flies straight up. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS591
01:41:21,00 --> 01:41:26,50
The trooper falls into the bomb's rear propeller. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS593
01:41:28,00 --> 01:41:35,50
The pilot levels out and glances around. SOMEONE forces open the cockpit hatch and pulls the eject handle. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS594
01:41:35,00 --> 01:41:44,50
SOMEONE hops into the now empty cockpit and closes the canopy. He steers the flying bomb clockwise around SOMEONE's plane. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS595
01:41:46,00 --> 01:41:54,50
SOMEONE watches SOMEONE on a radar screen and fires bolts of blue energy from the plane's rotary cannon. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS596
01:41:56,00 --> 01:42:02,50
SOMEONE dodges the blasts, then flies in behind the bomber. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS597
01:42:07,00 --> 01:42:13,50
He speeds toward the open bay door and crashes into the plane's hold. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS598
01:42:13,00 --> 01:42:20,50
SOMEONE opens the hatch and climbs out. He picks up his shield and slides it onto his left forearm. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS599
01:42:23,00 --> 01:42:32,50
SOMEONE slowly opens a door and peers into the plane's spacious cockpit where a high-backed chair sits in front of a bank of windows. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS600
01:42:32,00 --> 01:42:39,50
Passing the mechanism containing the glowing blue energy source, he creeps toward the back of the chair. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS601
01:42:39,00 --> 01:42:45,50
SOMEONE steps out from behind him and fires a blaster. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS603
01:42:47,00 --> 01:42:52,50
SOMEONE blocks the shot. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS604
01:42:51,00 --> 01:43:03,50
Using his shield as cover, SOMEONE runs up and punches SOMEONE in the stomach causing him to drop his blaster. He slices at his throat with the shield, but SOMEONE dodges and punches SOMEONE to the deck. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS605
01:43:01,00 --> 01:43:13,50
SOMEONE kicks him in the stomach. SOMEONE grabs his leg and the two men grapple. SOMEONE reaches for the blaster, but SOMEONE throws a box and knocks it away. SOMEONE puts SOMEONE in a chokehold. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS606
01:43:13,00 --> 01:43:32,50
The two men roll across the energy mechanism in the center of the cockpit and spill onto the floor. SOMEONE picks up his shield, but SOMEONE wrests it away and smacks SOMEONE across the face with it. SOMEONE pins down SOMEONE but he head-butts SOMEONE off of him. SOMEONE hurls SOMEONE into the controls causing the plane to head into a steep dive. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS607
01:43:30,00 --> 01:43:36,50
Now in free fall, the two men continue to fight as they float weightlessly. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS608
01:43:33,00 --> 01:43:38,50
SOMEONE leaps and pins SOMEONE to the ceiling. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS609
01:43:36,00 --> 01:43:42,50
They trade punches, then SOMEONE boots SOMEONE into the far wall. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS611
01:43:42,00 --> 01:43:51,50
As the plane dives through a layer of clouds, SOMEONE pulls himself to the controls and re-engages the autopilot. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS612
01:43:48,00 --> 01:43:54,50
As the plane levels out again, SOMEONE slams onto the deck. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS614
01:43:55,00 --> 01:44:02,50
SOMEONE turns and pulls out a pistol blaster as he scans the room. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS618
01:44:15,00 --> 01:44:28,50
SOMEONE dives behind metal struts as SOMEONE fires at him. SOMEONE flings his shield, striking SOMEONE and smashing him into the energy mechanism which begins to spark and flicker with blue light. SOMEONE staggers to his feet. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS619
01:44:32,00 --> 01:44:37,50
SOMEONE picks up the cube-shaped energy source. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS620
01:44:35,00 --> 01:44:41,50
As he stares into it, vaporous flashes of blue light fill the air. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS622
01:44:41,00 --> 01:44:46,50
A sphere of energy expands around SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS623
01:44:47,00 --> 01:44:53,50
SOMEONE stands at the far end of the cockpit as the cube brightens. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS624
01:44:53,00 --> 01:45:01,50
An intensifying beam shoots out of the top of the cube and SOMEONE's fingers begin to smoke. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS625
01:45:06,00 --> 01:45:12,50
The energy beam shoots out of the top of the plane and into the sky. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS626
01:45:12,00 --> 01:45:19,50
The light inside the cockpit dims. SOMEONE is gone. The cube drops onto the floor. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS627
01:45:17,00 --> 01:45:27,50
SOMEONE picks up his shield and watches as the cube burns a hole through the deck, and plummets out of sight. SOMEONE takes of his helmet and sits in the pilot's chair. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS628
01:45:25,00 --> 01:45:31,50
A radar display reads, ZIEL, New York City. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS629
01:45:28,00 --> 01:45:35,50
Grabbing the controls, SOMEONE steers out of the vast expanse of clouds. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS630
01:45:34,00 --> 01:45:40,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and Col. SOMEONE wait in the control tower. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS631
01:46:19,00 --> 01:46:26,50
A pair of vapor trails stream behind the plane as it banks through a layer of clouds. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS632
01:46:30,00 --> 01:46:36,50
SOMEONE blinks, then furrows her brow, and presses her lips together. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS633
01:46:33,00 --> 01:46:39,50
SOMEONE takes out his compass with the photo of SOMEONE in the lid 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS634
01:46:36,00 --> 01:46:41,50
and sets it atop the plane's controls. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS635
01:46:39,00 --> 01:46:47,50
He stares at the photo then pushes down on the steering yoke causing the plane to dive steeply. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS636
01:46:50,00 --> 01:46:56,50
SOMEONE continues to stare at the photo as the plane descends. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS638
01:47:02,00 --> 01:47:08,50
The plane dives toward an ice-covered land mass. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS639
01:47:08,00 --> 01:47:14,50
In the control tower, tears stream down SOMEONE's cheeks. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS640
01:47:31,00 --> 01:47:36,50
SOMEONE closes her eyes and smiles. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS641
01:47:56,00 --> 01:48:00,50
SOMEONE looks down. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS642
01:48:01,00 --> 01:48:07,50
As SOMEONE lowers her head, SOMEONE walks out, leaving her alone. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS643
01:48:13,00 --> 01:48:20,50
The sun shines low in the sky across a windblown expanse of ice and snow. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS644
01:48:18,00 --> 01:48:25,50
Scarring the landscape, deep furrows run toward the remains of the crashed plane. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS645
01:48:25,00 --> 01:48:32,50
Dark smoke pours out of an engine as the plane shifts and settles. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS646
01:48:38,00 --> 01:48:44,50
A broken wing reaches skyward as snow blows over it. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS647
01:48:48,00 --> 01:48:59,50
In Trafalgar Square, planes streak over cheering crowds waving British flags. A serviceman holds a newspaper, V-Day It's Over In Europe. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS648
01:48:56,00 --> 01:49:02,50
In a pub, the men of the 107th clink glasses together. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS649
01:49:01,00 --> 01:49:07,50
The men drink as people smile and hug one another around them. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS650
01:49:08,00 --> 01:49:16,50
Now, an underwater robot stretches out a claw and picks up the glowing blue energy cube off the ocean floor. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS651
01:49:15,00 --> 01:49:21,50
In a ship's pilothouse, SOMEONE Stark watches the robot on a monitor. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS652
01:49:35,00 --> 01:49:41,50
Back in the Allied headquarters, people pack up supplies. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS653
01:49:39,00 --> 01:49:45,50
Col. SOMEONE walks up to Agent SOMEONE and sets down a folder, then continues on. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS654
01:49:48,00 --> 01:49:54,50
She picks up the classified file which is marked Captain America, 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS656
01:49:52,00 --> 01:49:58,50
She opens the folder, revealing a half-hidden photo. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS657
01:50:02,00 --> 01:50:10,50
Taking a deep breath, she takes out the photo which depicts SOMEONE before his transformation, just a skinny kid from Brooklyn. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS659
01:50:11,00 --> 01:50:20,50
Outside, a young boy holds a garbage can lid painted like Captain America's shield as he plays with his friends. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS660
01:50:46,00 --> 01:50:53,50
Lying in a brightly lit hospital room, SOMEONE flickers open his eyes. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS661
01:51:08,00 --> 01:51:13,50
He slides his feet to the floor and sits up. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS662
01:51:25,00 --> 01:51:30,50
SOMEONE stares at a nearby radio. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS663
01:51:38,00 --> 01:51:43,50
A woman with curly brown hair walks in. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS664
01:51:47,00 --> 01:51:54,50
Furrowing his brow, SOMEONE stares at her, then glances toward a sunlit window. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS665
01:52:08,00 --> 01:52:13,50
The woman's smile falls as SOMEONE stands. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS666
01:52:18,00 --> 01:52:28,50
Two men in Kevlar body armor step into the room. A moment later, their bodies fly through a false wall revealing the hospital room to be inside a warehouse. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS667
01:52:27,00 --> 01:52:31,50
SOMEONE runs out of an exit. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS668
01:52:34,00 --> 01:52:49,50
SOMEONE barrels past security guards as he races down a hallway. He dashes out of a modern office building and into a city street. SOMEONE runs into the middle of Times Square, then stops and gazes at the brightly lit signs and video screens all around him. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS669
01:52:50,00 --> 01:52:55,50
Black SUVs converge on his position. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS671
01:52:56,00 --> 01:53:03,50
A goateed man wearing a black turtleneck trench coat and eye patch strides up to SOMEONE. 

CAPTAIN_AMERICA_DVS672
01:53:20,00 --> 01:53:26,50
SOMEONE blinks, then gazes at his surroundings.
