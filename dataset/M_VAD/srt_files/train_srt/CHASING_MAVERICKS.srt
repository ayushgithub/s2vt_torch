CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS37
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:49,50
Another wave hits the rocks and his head pops out of the water, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS38
00:02:46,00 --> 00:02:52,50
his outstretched hands lap against the surface. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS39
00:02:50,00 --> 00:02:56,50
He tries to shake the salty water off his face. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS40
00:02:53,00 --> 00:02:59,50
The girl watches in anguish as another wave rolls over him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS41
00:02:57,00 --> 00:03:01,50
Foam rains down. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS42
00:02:59,00 --> 00:03:04,50
His white tennis shoes dangle helplessly toward the deep. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS44
00:03:04,00 --> 00:03:10,50
As a yellow shape floats overhead, a hand reaches down and pulls him up by the scruff of his collar. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS45
00:03:12,00 --> 00:03:19,50
A shaggy haired man with the same colored beard lays the boy, face first, on his surfboard. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS46
00:03:17,00 --> 00:03:23,50
He glances over his shoulder and paddles his muscular arms, breathing hard. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS47
00:03:21,00 --> 00:03:27,50
As a 15-foot wave begins to crest, he drops down through the face of it. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS48
00:03:25,00 --> 00:03:31,50
The front of the board bounces through the breaking wave as they emerge safely. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS49
00:03:30,00 --> 00:03:37,50
The girl watches, then runs to meet them with the dog in tow. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS50
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:42,50
As they glide through calmer water, SOMEONE looks around with an ecstatic, open-mouthed grin. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS52
00:03:41,00 --> 00:03:48,50
The man drives them along a coastal road in his boxy white van. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS54
00:04:40,00 --> 00:04:44,50
His rescuer narrows his eyes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS55
00:04:43,00 --> 00:04:49,50
Night falls as the van heads into a beach town. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS57
00:04:47,00 --> 00:04:52,50
Words appear. "Santa Cruz, California, 1987." 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS58
00:04:50,00 --> 00:04:55,50
The van pulls up beside a small house. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS59
00:05:05,00 --> 00:05:11,50
As the man turns back to the wheel, SOMEONE knocks on his window. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS60
00:05:08,00 --> 00:05:13,50
He rolls window down with a wry look. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS61
00:05:25,00 --> 00:05:29,50
He rolls ahead. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS62
00:05:28,00 --> 00:05:32,50
He puts the van in park. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS64
00:05:35,00 --> 00:05:40,50
The man nods and pulls away. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS65
00:05:37,00 --> 00:05:44,50
As SOMEONE pushes his bike, he turns back to see the van park a few doors down the street. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS66
00:05:42,00 --> 00:05:48,50
The girl watches, holding her dog, as the man gets out. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS67
00:05:49,00 --> 00:05:53,50
He turns away. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS68
00:05:50,00 --> 00:05:54,50
SOMEONE looks at the girl. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS69
00:05:59,00 --> 00:06:04,50
She gives him a peck on the cheek and dashes away. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS70
00:06:01,00 --> 00:06:06,50
SOMEONE blinks with a starry-eyed smile. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS71
00:06:04,00 --> 00:06:09,50
The man passes through a white picket fence and pauses. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS72
00:06:08,00 --> 00:06:15,50
Beyond a window, a demure, dark haired woman bounces a crying baby in her arms. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS73
00:06:12,00 --> 00:06:16,50
The man hesitates. SOMEONE flicks on a light. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS75
00:06:16,00 --> 00:06:22,50
He sets his jacket on a counter. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS76
00:06:19,00 --> 00:06:26,50
He notices a US Armed Forces savings check for $400 payable to SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS78
00:06:27,00 --> 00:06:33,50
He spots a crumpled hand-written note atop an unopened envelope marked, Past Due. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS80
00:06:33,00 --> 00:06:38,50
As he reads the note, his brow creases. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS81
00:06:37,00 --> 00:06:42,50
He looks off then hurries down the hall. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS82
00:06:41,00 --> 00:06:45,50
He stops in a doorway. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS83
00:06:43,00 --> 00:06:47,50
In the dim light of a bedside lamp, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS84
00:06:45,00 --> 00:06:50,50
a blonde woman lies on her side in a rumpled bed. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS85
00:06:48,00 --> 00:06:53,50
SOMEONE creeps in and picks up a bottle on her nightstand. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS86
00:06:51,00 --> 00:06:56,50
Sniffing it, he recoils. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS88
00:06:55,00 --> 00:06:59,50
As he turns to go, she reaches for his hand. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS89
00:07:03,00 --> 00:07:09,50
She rolls onto her back, one arm bent over her head. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS90
00:07:10,00 --> 00:07:15,50
She looks at him through bleary eyes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS91
00:07:14,00 --> 00:07:18,50
She turns away. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS92
00:07:15,00 --> 00:07:19,50
He takes the bottle. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS93
00:07:17,00 --> 00:07:22,50
In the kitchen, he pours its contents down the drain. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS94
00:07:24,00 --> 00:07:32,50
Taking off his shirt, SOMEONE passes a couch and a divider that separates the living room from his bed. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS95
00:07:30,00 --> 00:07:34,50
An envelope on his pillow reads. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS97
00:07:33,00 --> 00:07:40,50
He turns on the light and takes it in his hands, looking down at it. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS98
00:07:42,00 --> 00:07:50,50
Later, he places a wooden cigar box on his bed and sets the unopened envelope inside. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS101
00:07:50,00 --> 00:07:56,50
in his dimly hit kitchen, the sandy haired man unscrews the top of a canister. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS102
00:07:53,00 --> 00:07:59,50
He opens a blue cabinet and the top hinge breaks loose. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS103
00:07:57,00 --> 00:08:01,50
The dark haired woman peeks in. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS104
00:08:23,00 --> 00:08:28,50
He leans down and kisses her. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS105
00:08:32,00 --> 00:08:36,50
She walks away. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS106
00:08:34,00 --> 00:08:39,50
Dawn breaks over a rundown cottage with a dirt drive. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS107
00:08:39,00 --> 00:08:45,50
Inside, a cleaned up radiant SOMEONE stands before him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS108
00:08:57,00 --> 00:09:03,50
He watches her walk out, a hopeful smile on his face. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS109
00:09:00,00 --> 00:09:06,50
Later, a clock on the wall reads 1:15. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS111
00:09:05,00 --> 00:09:10,50
Nibbling on pretzel rods, SOMEONE sits at the kitchen table, eyeing it. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS112
00:09:08,00 --> 00:09:12,50
With a sigh, he rises. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS113
00:09:10,00 --> 00:09:16,50
He opens the doors of a shed and pads inside barefoot. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS114
00:09:13,00 --> 00:09:19,50
An old bicycle rests beside a bunch of garden tools. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS115
00:09:17,00 --> 00:09:22,50
SOMEONE squats down and looks behind a metal utility shelf. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS116
00:09:20,00 --> 00:09:26,50
He hoists up a dirty six foot long surfboard, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS117
00:09:23,00 --> 00:09:29,50
examining a crack running horizontally across its deck. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS119
00:09:28,00 --> 00:09:34,50
Laying the board flat, he paints a thin layer of glue along the crack with a small applicator. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS120
00:09:32,00 --> 00:09:38,50
He grimaces then picks up the can, pouring it along the length of the crack. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS121
00:09:36,00 --> 00:09:43,50
He presses the board together and the clear glue bubbles up from the mended seam. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS122
00:09:41,00 --> 00:09:45,50
He squints around the shed. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS123
00:09:46,00 --> 00:09:51,50
Now, he duct tapes the seam, flips the board over and smooths it across the other side. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS125
00:09:52,00 --> 00:09:58,50
He looks down the length of the board to the tail and finds three empty slits. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS126
00:09:56,00 --> 00:10:00,50
He sighs. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS127
00:09:57,00 --> 00:10:05,50
Now, in a baggy black wet suit, he lugs the board over to the shaggy haired man's house. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS128
00:10:02,00 --> 00:10:09,50
In the front yard, his wife sits on the grass with another woman and her little girl. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS130
00:10:45,00 --> 00:10:51,50
the woman opens the doors of a well-stocked surf shed and walks to the back. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS131
00:10:51,00 --> 00:10:55,50
SOMEONE gazes at two paddle boards stored overhead then over to a red long board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS133
00:10:57,00 --> 00:11:02,50
She notes the look of wonder on his face. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS134
00:11:07,00 --> 00:11:12,50
A picture of SOMEONE on a giant wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS135
00:11:11,00 --> 00:11:15,50
She hands him the fins. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS136
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:20,50
Now, SOMEONE walks down the street to the beachfront, struggling to keep the board under his arm. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS137
00:11:20,00 --> 00:11:25,50
He takes a rundown path, passing graffiti that reads, "Surf where you live." 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS139
00:11:24,00 --> 00:11:29,50
A man sips from a paper bag. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS140
00:11:26,00 --> 00:11:32,50
Surfboards lean against a rusted metal guardrail. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS141
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:36,50
SOMEONE rounds a corner and stops, gazing past a cliff to the ocean below. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS142
00:11:33,00 --> 00:11:40,50
A long gentle wave rolls toward dozens of waiting surfers. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS143
00:11:38,00 --> 00:11:44,50
Behind him, a boy smashes a side view mirror with a bat. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS145
00:11:46,00 --> 00:11:52,50
The boy scowls under his black knit cap and swaggers off. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS146
00:11:50,00 --> 00:11:55,50
With a furrowed brow, SOMEONE heads down to the water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS147
00:11:53,00 --> 00:11:59,50
A trio of surfers his own age sits on the sand by their boards. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS148
00:11:56,00 --> 00:12:02,50
They watch SOMEONE pass, lugging his old, dirty board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS149
00:11:59,00 --> 00:12:04,50
He stops and looks out at the waves. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS150
00:12:04,00 --> 00:12:11,50
SOMEONE, on his bright yellow long board, drops into a gentle five-foot curl. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS152
00:12:11,00 --> 00:12:15,50
He rises and crouches, carving up and down the face of the wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS153
00:12:13,00 --> 00:12:19,50
With each effortless swerve, his fingertips graze the water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS154
00:12:17,00 --> 00:12:22,50
SOMEONE grins, completely entranced. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS155
00:12:26,00 --> 00:12:34,50
SOMEONE smacks the lip of the wave, glides back down, and cross-steps up the board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS156
00:12:31,00 --> 00:12:39,50
With his left foot planted on the nose, he bows his head, letting the lip of wave wet his hair. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS157
00:12:43,00 --> 00:12:48,50
SOMEONE purses his lips with determination and heads in. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS159
00:12:48,00 --> 00:12:51,50
Now, lying on his stomach, he paddles out. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS160
00:12:49,00 --> 00:12:56,50
Two surfers paddling in front of him duck dive under an oncoming wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS161
00:12:53,00 --> 00:12:58,50
SOMEONE takes a deep breath and lowers his head. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS162
00:12:56,00 --> 00:13:00,50
The board crashes over the break. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS163
00:12:58,00 --> 00:13:04,50
He holds on, shaking his drenched head, and keeps paddling. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS164
00:13:01,00 --> 00:13:07,50
Another wave of froth rushing into him, pushing him back. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS165
00:13:05,00 --> 00:13:10,50
He shakes it off again and keeps paddling. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS166
00:13:07,00 --> 00:13:14,50
Farther out, a round faced boy sits on his board, observing with a worried look. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS167
00:13:12,00 --> 00:13:19,50
As another break hits SOMEONE, the board goes vertical and flips out of his hands. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS168
00:13:17,00 --> 00:13:21,50
The round faced boy shakes his head. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS169
00:13:19,00 --> 00:13:24,50
SOMEONE surfaces, blood trickling from his mouth. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS170
00:13:21,00 --> 00:13:26,50
The boy paddles over. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS171
00:13:27,00 --> 00:13:31,50
SOMEONE struggles back onto the board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS172
00:13:38,00 --> 00:13:42,50
SOMEONE shoots him an impatient look. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS173
00:13:49,00 --> 00:13:54,50
He puts his hand on SOMEONE's tail. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS174
00:13:52,00 --> 00:13:56,50
They look over their shoulders. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS175
00:13:55,00 --> 00:13:59,50
A swell builds behind them. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS176
00:13:59,00 --> 00:14:05,50
On the beach, SOMEONE turns around and watches. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS177
00:14:02,00 --> 00:14:08,50
SOMEONE paddles and pushes onto his hands and knees. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS178
00:14:05,00 --> 00:14:10,50
He brings his left foot up, then his right. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS179
00:14:08,00 --> 00:14:13,50
Crouching, he lets go of the rails. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS180
00:14:10,00 --> 00:14:15,50
A grin pulls at SOMEONE's lip. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS181
00:14:13,00 --> 00:14:18,50
Hunched over and jaw hanging slack, SOMEONE looks up. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS182
00:14:16,00 --> 00:14:22,50
The cliffs get closer as he glides across the water toward shore. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS183
00:14:23,00 --> 00:14:28,50
Words appear - "Seven years later." 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS184
00:14:25,00 --> 00:14:33,50
A curly haired teenage SOMEONE runs his hand along a wave as he easily carves up and down its face. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS185
00:14:31,00 --> 00:14:36,50
Clad in a blue sleeved wetsuit, he maneuvers around other paddling surfers, then cross-steps up the board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS188
00:14:37,00 --> 00:14:44,50
He crouches down, swerves his board back to the lip, and rides it back down. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS189
00:14:42,00 --> 00:14:48,50
Now, he does a floater, riding along the top of the curl. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS190
00:14:47,00 --> 00:14:55,50
High above on the cliff, a teenage boy scowls, watching him with his buddies. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS192
00:14:56,00 --> 00:15:04,50
SOMEONE finishes by carving up the top of the wave and leaping over it with his hands on the rails. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS193
00:15:01,00 --> 00:15:07,50
Wearing an ear-to-ear grin, he paddles toward shore. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS194
00:15:07,00 --> 00:15:13,50
He nears a younger surfer as a swell creeps up behind them. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS195
00:15:13,00 --> 00:15:20,50
The novice gets to his feet. Another teen holds out his arm in mock indignation. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS196
00:15:25,00 --> 00:15:32,50
The scowling boy sits with his pals at the top of the steps, tapping a bat in his hand. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS197
00:15:42,00 --> 00:15:47,50
SOMEONE gives it a light tap and walks on. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS198
00:15:47,00 --> 00:15:53,50
SOMEONE and Blond carry their surfboards down the street. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS199
00:15:53,00 --> 00:16:00,50
A teenage girl with long blonde hair climbs into a rainbow colored VW bus. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS200
00:16:11,00 --> 00:16:18,50
As she climbs into the passenger seat and shuts the door, SOMEONE's smile fades. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS201
00:16:15,00 --> 00:16:21,50
He gazes after the van as it putters away. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS202
00:16:26,00 --> 00:16:30,50
SOMEONE takes off. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS203
00:16:27,00 --> 00:16:33,50
He races through an open door to find SOMEONE on the kitchen floor. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS204
00:16:30,00 --> 00:16:35,50
A man stands over her. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS205
00:16:38,00 --> 00:16:42,50
SOMEONE grabs the man. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS206
00:16:40,00 --> 00:16:45,50
The man backs out. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS207
00:16:44,00 --> 00:16:49,50
SOMEONE tackles him out the front door. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS208
00:16:46,00 --> 00:16:50,50
They land on the grass. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS209
00:16:48,00 --> 00:16:54,50
Blond tries to pull SOMEONE off as a police car rounds the corner. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS210
00:16:57,00 --> 00:17:04,50
Across the street, SOMEONE stands with his hands in his pockets watching the scene. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS211
00:17:02,00 --> 00:17:08,50
SOMEONE throws Blond off of him and looks up to see SOMEONE frowning. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS212
00:17:05,00 --> 00:17:10,50
The older surfer turns away. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS213
00:17:08,00 --> 00:17:14,50
Now, SOMEONE races down a darkened beach to the waves. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS214
00:17:11,00 --> 00:17:18,50
He leaps onto the board and paddles out, away from the flashing lights of the boardwalk. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS215
00:17:16,00 --> 00:17:22,50
He sits up on the board, letting his feet dangle in the water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS216
00:17:31,00 --> 00:17:36,50
Now on his bed, SOMEONE sketches a surfer entering a tube. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS217
00:17:34,00 --> 00:17:40,50
Using a pen on notepaper, he adds intricate detail to the drawing. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS218
00:17:38,00 --> 00:17:45,50
Nearby, a trophy bearing his name stands by an alarm clock reading 4:00. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS220
00:17:43,00 --> 00:17:51,50
In his sweats, SOMEONE sits up and peeks out a window to find SOMEONE heading out to his van across the street. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS222
00:17:50,00 --> 00:17:54,50
In the darkness, he hefts a surfboard up to the roof. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS223
00:17:52,00 --> 00:17:58,50
SOMEONE hurriedly grabs his things and rushes out the door. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS224
00:17:55,00 --> 00:18:00,50
He dashes down the quiet pre-dawn street. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS225
00:17:58,00 --> 00:18:03,50
As SOMEONE's van pulls away, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS226
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:05,50
he hops onto the rear bumper, clutching the ladder. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS228
00:18:09,00 --> 00:18:13,50
At the wheel, SOMEONE rides on the van's roof. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS230
00:18:22,00 --> 00:18:28,50
the van passes a sign marking California Highway 1N. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS231
00:18:26,00 --> 00:18:31,50
SOMEONE stares at it, then zips up his jacket. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS232
00:18:29,00 --> 00:18:35,50
Now, the van travels through misty hills in the pale light of dawn. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS233
00:18:33,00 --> 00:18:41,50
Later, it follows a coastal road that ascends parallel to a shelf of dizzying ocean-side cliffs. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS234
00:18:39,00 --> 00:18:47,50
Now, fishing boats drift in a calm bay as the van follows a winding road uphill. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS236
00:18:45,00 --> 00:18:52,50
Still on the roof, SOMEONE clutches the front bar of the surfboard rack as he rides on his belly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS237
00:18:49,00 --> 00:18:55,50
Ahead, a man gets out of an old pickup. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS238
00:18:52,00 --> 00:18:58,50
SOMEONE climbs down the back of the van and hops off. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS239
00:18:58,00 --> 00:19:03,50
As the van passes between two posts, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS240
00:19:00,00 --> 00:19:05,50
SOMEONE blocks them off with a chain. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS244
00:19:07,00 --> 00:19:13,50
Crouched in nearby brush, SOMEONE creeps closer. On a ridge ahead, three athletic dark haired men in wetsuits wait with surfboards. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS245
00:19:10,00 --> 00:19:16,50
One with close cropped hair crouches, waxing his down. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS246
00:19:14,00 --> 00:19:22,50
Carrying a cherry red board, SOMEONE joins the men and greets the shorthaired one with a casual handclasp. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS247
00:19:34,00 --> 00:19:39,50
The men head off with their boards. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS248
00:19:36,00 --> 00:19:42,50
Creeping around a knoll, we find them descending a winding path 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS249
00:19:40,00 --> 00:19:45,50
cutting through a slope blanketed with vegetation. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS251
00:19:44,00 --> 00:19:51,50
Peering over a ridge, SOMEONE finds the men approaching a small isolated beach at the base of the slope. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS252
00:19:48,00 --> 00:19:55,50
The team moves along the ridge, keeping his eager gaze fixed on the older surfers. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS254
00:19:56,00 --> 00:20:00,50
From the sandy beach, the four men trot into the water and stretch out on their boards. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS256
00:19:59,00 --> 00:20:06,50
As they paddle far out, we spot a meteorological complex, complete with a satellite dish perched on a bluff in the distance. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS259
00:20:07,00 --> 00:20:14,50
SOMEONE skirts around the end of a chain-linked fence and dashes along the edge. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS260
00:20:12,00 --> 00:20:18,50
Staggering, he finds his balance then gazes out. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS261
00:20:15,00 --> 00:20:22,50
On the water, waves swell and crest several stories high. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS262
00:20:19,00 --> 00:20:25,50
Their powerful crashes send up massive bursts of white foam. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS263
00:20:23,00 --> 00:20:28,50
A cleanly breaking wave forms a long tube. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS264
00:20:26,00 --> 00:20:31,50
Wearing a wetsuit with a billed skull-fitted hood, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS265
00:20:29,00 --> 00:20:34,50
SOMEONE paddles his board up a high wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS266
00:20:31,00 --> 00:20:38,50
SOMEONE pants excitedly, his lips curled into a faint smile. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS267
00:20:35,00 --> 00:20:42,50
The older surfer faces a cresting wave that towers stories above him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS268
00:20:40,00 --> 00:20:45,50
SOMEONE follows his friends to the top, then rides his board down the other side. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS271
00:20:46,00 --> 00:20:51,50
From the distant bluffs, SOMEONE appears as a tiny speck as he looks on. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS272
00:20:49,00 --> 00:20:56,50
One of SOMEONE's friends takes a wave and rides down the 20-foot face. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS273
00:20:54,00 --> 00:21:01,50
The men take one wave after another, their boards cleanly skimming the glassy water beneath their feet. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS274
00:20:59,00 --> 00:21:04,50
SOMEONE's shoulders heave as he takes in the spectacle. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS275
00:21:01,00 --> 00:21:08,50
One surfer skirts just ahead of the white water which seems to pursue him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS276
00:21:06,00 --> 00:21:12,50
Two others share a broad section of the wave's foamy face. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS277
00:21:09,00 --> 00:21:16,50
Near shore, a wave crashes violently against a huge jagged rock formation. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS278
00:21:14,00 --> 00:21:20,50
Further out, a swelling wave fills our view. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS279
00:21:17,00 --> 00:21:23,50
SOMEONE glances over his shoulder as he paddles along its face. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS280
00:21:21,00 --> 00:21:28,50
As SOMEONE looks on ecstatically, the older surfer pops up at the wave's crest, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS281
00:21:25,00 --> 00:21:31,50
then rides his board 20 feet down the glassy face. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS282
00:21:29,00 --> 00:21:35,50
The wave breaks behind him, forming an oncoming mass of churning white water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS283
00:21:34,00 --> 00:21:44,50
SOMEONE reaches the foot of the wave, briefly vanishing from view within the rolling tides before he emerges to take more of the face. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS284
00:21:42,00 --> 00:21:49,50
He skirts the ends of the pursuing white water, staying up as the wave diminishes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS285
00:21:50,00 --> 00:21:55,50
SOMEONE joyfully raises both fists. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS286
00:21:56,00 --> 00:22:02,50
Looking around, SOMEONE spots the teen on the bluffs. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS287
00:21:59,00 --> 00:22:05,50
As SOMEONE catches his breath, the older man regards him gravely. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS288
00:22:03,00 --> 00:22:07,50
Now in the speeding van. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS289
00:22:17,00 --> 00:22:21,50
SOMEONE gives a sheepish nod. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS290
00:22:23,00 --> 00:22:30,50
SOMEONE slaps a small cube shaped weather radio perched on a cup holder tray. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS291
00:22:27,00 --> 00:22:32,50
SOMEONE shifts his gaze and gulps, then faces him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS292
00:22:39,00 --> 00:22:44,50
Later, the van pulls up in front of SOMEONE's house. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS293
00:22:42,00 --> 00:22:47,50
A short board hangs over the garage door. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS294
00:22:44,00 --> 00:22:49,50
SOMEONE cuts the van's ignition. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS295
00:22:47,00 --> 00:22:53,50
Beside him, the teen shifts his intimidated gaze 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS296
00:22:50,00 --> 00:22:54,50
but lingers in his seat. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS297
00:23:04,00 --> 00:23:09,50
The boy stares at his lap. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS299
00:23:19,00 --> 00:23:25,50
SOMEONE glances toward SOMEONE's house and nods understandingly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS300
00:23:26,00 --> 00:23:31,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE climb out of the van. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS301
00:24:01,00 --> 00:24:05,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE clasp their hands. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS302
00:24:05,00 --> 00:24:10,50
He backs the teen against the shed. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS303
00:24:13,00 --> 00:24:18,50
SOMEONE swaggers into his shed. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS304
00:24:27,00 --> 00:24:31,50
He gathers up some tools. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS305
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:08,50
SOMEONE stares up at him earnestly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS306
00:25:09,00 --> 00:25:13,50
SOMEONE turns away. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS307
00:25:17,00 --> 00:25:22,50
Shaking his head, the teen turns away and heads home. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS308
00:25:20,00 --> 00:25:25,50
SOMEONE hefts a box of tools and supplies. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS309
00:25:23,00 --> 00:25:28,50
Coming out of the shed, he gazes after SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS310
00:25:29,00 --> 00:25:35,50
Turning, he finds his wife watching from the front door of their home. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS311
00:25:32,00 --> 00:25:38,50
As she slips inside, he follows her to a baby's nursery. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS312
00:26:17,00 --> 00:26:21,50
She gives him a pointed look. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS313
00:26:19,00 --> 00:26:26,50
SOMEONE stares as his wife with a furrowed brow, then concedes a small nod. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS315
00:26:25,00 --> 00:26:30,50
Later in his shed, he tends to his cherry red surfboard. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS316
00:26:27,00 --> 00:26:33,50
Other boards rest in a rack at the back of the shed. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS317
00:26:31,00 --> 00:26:37,50
Taking a break, SOMEONE thoughtfully wipes his hands off with a rag. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS319
00:26:36,00 --> 00:26:42,50
At Pleasure Pizza, SOMEONE ladles sauce over shredded cheese on a disk of dough. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS320
00:26:49,00 --> 00:26:55,50
Putting the order in, Blond notices SOMEONE's handiwork. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS321
00:27:20,00 --> 00:27:25,50
SOMEONE spots SOMEONE's van outside. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS322
00:27:27,00 --> 00:27:31,50
He rushes out. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS323
00:28:09,00 --> 00:28:15,50
As SOMEONE drives away, a grin spreads across SOMEONE's features. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS324
00:28:12,00 --> 00:28:16,50
He pumps his fists. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS325
00:28:15,00 --> 00:28:22,50
Now, SOMEONE's watch reads 6:30 as he waits in the doorway of his shed. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS326
00:28:19,00 --> 00:28:24,50
SOMEONE jogs into view, carrying a surfboard. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS327
00:28:28,00 --> 00:28:33,50
He points to the two long paddleboards. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS328
00:28:32,00 --> 00:28:37,50
Now in wetsuits, they each carry a board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS329
00:28:40,00 --> 00:28:44,50
SOMEONE taps a car with his board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS330
00:29:03,00 --> 00:29:08,50
Now, they carry the boards into the surf. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS331
00:29:09,00 --> 00:29:15,50
Later, on calm waters, they kneel on their respective boards. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS332
00:29:13,00 --> 00:29:19,50
They bend over, paddling both hands through the water at the same time. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS333
00:29:16,00 --> 00:29:21,50
Brackets on the boards hold water bottles. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS334
00:29:34,00 --> 00:29:38,50
They pause and sit up. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS335
00:30:45,00 --> 00:30:51,50
At night, a figure jumps from a tree to a second story window of a house. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS336
00:30:49,00 --> 00:30:53,50
Inside, SOMEONE reads on her bed. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS337
00:30:51,00 --> 00:30:56,50
Sofie leaves her side to greet SOMEONE at the window. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS338
00:30:55,00 --> 00:30:59,50
SOMEONE dashes over. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS339
00:31:41,00 --> 00:31:46,50
Clad in a silky robe, SOMEONE beams at him fondly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS340
00:31:54,00 --> 00:32:00,50
Now, a skateboard rolls over a sunlit speed bump. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS341
00:31:57,00 --> 00:32:04,50
As SOMEONE rides it up the street, Blond skateboards a short distance behind him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS342
00:32:04,00 --> 00:32:11,50
As his friend splits off, SOMEONE pauses in front of an electronic store display window. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS343
00:32:08,00 --> 00:32:14,50
The young surfer notices a weather radio priced at $89. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS344
00:32:12,00 --> 00:32:19,50
In the window glass, a reflection shows Blond passing something off to two of thuggish bullies. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS345
00:32:25,00 --> 00:32:30,50
SOMEONE gazes after his friend with a concerned frown 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS346
00:32:27,00 --> 00:32:32,50
then follows him off on his skateboard. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS347
00:32:29,00 --> 00:32:34,50
They take turns jumping another speed bump. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS348
00:32:32,00 --> 00:32:38,50
Now outside an abandoned house, a hammock hangs over a back patio. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS349
00:32:36,00 --> 00:32:45,50
In a drained swimming pool, a kid with glasses and a hunter's cap preform skateboarding tricks on the curved concrete. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS350
00:32:42,00 --> 00:32:49,50
Blond joins him, skateboarding up and down the walls of the basin. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS351
00:32:46,00 --> 00:32:53,50
At the rim, SOMEONE holds onto a fence as he flips his board with his feet. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS352
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:58,50
The glass of the house's sunroom reflects the three teens as they skateboard in and out of the dry pool. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS353
00:32:56,00 --> 00:33:00,50
The bespectacled kid wipes out. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS354
00:32:58,00 --> 00:33:04,50
Recovering, he takes a smooth turn around the pool. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS355
00:33:20,00 --> 00:33:25,50
The bespectacled kid practices some more. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS356
00:33:30,00 --> 00:33:36,50
Blond taps him on the stomach then joins their other friend. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS357
00:33:33,00 --> 00:33:38,50
Later, SOMEONE rides a bike up to a house. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS358
00:33:39,00 --> 00:33:46,50
Working on the roof, SOMEONE climbs down a ladder and carries his tools over. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS359
00:33:49,00 --> 00:33:53,50
He sets the tools in his van. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS360
00:33:53,00 --> 00:33:58,50
SOMEONE picks up a large shovel. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS361
00:34:04,00 --> 00:34:10,50
He leaves SOMEONE clutching the shovel by a large pile of SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS362
00:34:08,00 --> 00:34:14,50
Now we float over the Santa Cruz boardwalk's Giant Dipper rollercoaster. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS363
00:34:11,00 --> 00:34:16,50
SOMEONE paddles on the water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS364
00:34:32,00 --> 00:34:38,50
SOMEONE stops paddling then rolls off his board and into the water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS365
00:34:35,00 --> 00:34:40,50
SOMEONE halts and looks back. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS366
00:34:37,00 --> 00:34:43,50
The gently rolling current shows no sign of the boy. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS367
00:34:42,00 --> 00:34:47,50
He pops up and shakes out his curls. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS368
00:34:46,00 --> 00:34:51,50
SOMEONE shakes his head and faces the sea. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS370
00:34:52,00 --> 00:34:57,50
Now at home, SOMEONE makes a poster charting his training goals. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS371
00:34:55,00 --> 00:35:00,50
One bar tracks the miles to Monterey 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS372
00:34:57,00 --> 00:35:02,50
while another counts 4 minutes in 30-second increments. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS373
00:35:00,00 --> 00:35:06,50
He hangs the poster on two panels of corkboard on his wall. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS374
00:35:05,00 --> 00:35:10,50
Now, sipping tea in her kitchen, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS375
00:35:07,00 --> 00:35:13,50
SOMEONE's wife flips through a small book of black and white baby pictures. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS376
00:35:21,00 --> 00:35:25,50
SOMEONE makes a sandwich. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS377
00:35:29,00 --> 00:35:35,50
SOMEONE chuckles fondly at his wife as she eyes the pictures wistfully. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS378
00:35:32,00 --> 00:35:38,50
As he turns away, she leaves the table, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS379
00:35:35,00 --> 00:35:40,50
steps in close, and rubs his back. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS380
00:35:54,00 --> 00:35:59,50
SOMEONE turns to face her, his gaze receptive. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS381
00:36:04,00 --> 00:36:08,50
SOMEONE shifts his conflicted gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS382
00:36:06,00 --> 00:36:13,50
Looking down, he finds his wife's delicate features set in a solemn expression. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS383
00:36:10,00 --> 00:36:15,50
SOMEONE hangs his head and nods. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS384
00:36:14,00 --> 00:36:18,50
His wife beams gratefully. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS385
00:36:25,00 --> 00:36:29,50
She steps out of the kitchen. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS386
00:36:26,00 --> 00:36:32,50
Now, a wall clock reads 6:25. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS387
00:36:29,00 --> 00:36:35,50
Heading out the door, SOMEONE finds a set of keys on a table. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS388
00:36:42,00 --> 00:36:47,50
SOMEONE opens her door then turns on a shower. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS389
00:36:46,00 --> 00:36:51,50
She remains curled up on her belly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS390
00:36:49,00 --> 00:36:54,50
At a sink piled high with dirty dishes, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS391
00:36:51,00 --> 00:36:57,50
SOMEONE shakes out a cup, then fills it with coffee and shifts his anxious gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS392
00:36:55,00 --> 00:37:01,50
Now, SOMEONE's van sits in the pouring rain outside his house. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS394
00:36:59,00 --> 00:37:05,50
SOMEONE flips through the old photos documenting his childhood. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS395
00:37:03,00 --> 00:37:07,50
One shows him on skis in the snow. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS396
00:37:05,00 --> 00:37:11,50
Another shows his boyhood-self sitting close to a father figure. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS397
00:37:08,00 --> 00:37:13,50
The next page is blank as well as the pages after it. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS399
00:37:12,00 --> 00:37:18,50
SOMEONE's brow furrows sadly as he flips through them. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS400
00:37:15,00 --> 00:37:20,50
SOMEONE arrives and climbs in. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS401
00:37:29,00 --> 00:37:35,50
SOMEONE takes a folded page from the teen and opens it. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS402
00:37:33,00 --> 00:37:38,50
As he looks it over, he lifts his brow and nods. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS403
00:37:52,00 --> 00:37:58,50
Now, SOMEONE's van speeds along the coastal highway. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS404
00:37:55,00 --> 00:38:00,50
Inside, SOMEONE eats a chocolate cupcake. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS405
00:38:01,00 --> 00:38:07,50
SOMEONE grabs the cupcake from him, eyes it, then tosses it in the back. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS406
00:38:08,00 --> 00:38:12,50
He tosses down a sandwich. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS407
00:38:29,00 --> 00:38:36,50
From overhead, crashing waves sweep white foam onto the stunning California shore. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS408
00:38:34,00 --> 00:38:41,50
Standing together, SOMEONE and SOMEONE hold long boards and gaze out at the waves. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS409
00:38:49,00 --> 00:38:54,50
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a determined look and nods. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS410
00:38:51,00 --> 00:38:57,50
He pulls his wetsuit hood over his blonde curls. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS411
00:38:54,00 --> 00:38:59,50
Now, the young surfer paddles out alone. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS412
00:38:57,00 --> 00:39:04,50
Using his arms, SOMEONE pushes up and floats over the crest of a modest wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS413
00:39:01,00 --> 00:39:08,50
He turtle rolls, dipping underneath the board as a much larger wave crashes down. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS415
00:39:07,00 --> 00:39:14,50
The board shoots out of the water with SOMEONE unseen and SOMEONE smiles from the beach. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS416
00:39:12,00 --> 00:39:18,50
As SOMEONE swims back to his board, another towering wave crashes down on him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS417
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:23,50
SOMEONE shakes his head, wearing a slight grin on his weathered face. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS418
00:39:21,00 --> 00:39:29,50
SOMEONE tries to regroup with his board but another wave catches him off guard and sweeps him back toward the beach. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS419
00:39:27,00 --> 00:39:34,50
Standing in chest high water, a small wave knocks him over and SOMEONE smiles. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS420
00:39:32,00 --> 00:39:39,50
Now, the young surfer stumbles onto the sand, drops his board, and collapses. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS421
00:39:39,00 --> 00:39:44,50
SOMEONE rips off his hood. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS422
00:39:41,00 --> 00:39:46,50
Now he follows SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS423
00:39:59,00 --> 00:40:03,50
SOMEONE sets down his board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS424
00:40:02,00 --> 00:40:06,50
They crouch down together. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS425
00:40:25,00 --> 00:40:29,50
SOMEONE pulls up his hood. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS426
00:40:30,00 --> 00:40:35,50
He grabs his board and heads to the water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS427
00:40:33,00 --> 00:40:40,50
Watching closely, SOMEONE stands up as SOMEONE paddles beside the protruding rock formations. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS428
00:40:38,00 --> 00:40:44,50
He pushes up over several small waves and continues further out. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS429
00:40:42,00 --> 00:40:48,50
SOMEONE's wide smile fades as SOMEONE heads for a much larger wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS430
00:40:46,00 --> 00:40:53,50
The veteran surfer lies flat on the board and busts through the top portion as it breaks. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS431
00:40:51,00 --> 00:40:59,50
Sitting on his board, SOMEONE holds two arms in the air and SOMEONE shows a beaming smile from the beach. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS432
00:40:56,00 --> 00:41:01,50
Now they walk the incline back to the van. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS433
00:41:34,00 --> 00:41:38,50
He stops and admires his mentor. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS434
00:41:36,00 --> 00:41:41,50
Later, SOMEONE rides his bike through an alley, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS435
00:41:38,00 --> 00:41:43,50
popping a wheelie on the way. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS436
00:41:40,00 --> 00:41:45,50
He notices SOMEONE walking nearby. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS437
00:41:43,00 --> 00:41:47,50
The bike slides out from under him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS438
00:42:02,00 --> 00:42:07,50
Now, SOMEONE climbs onto a roof. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS439
00:42:06,00 --> 00:42:13,50
She hops onto a flat section next to SOMEONE and they walk to the edge overlooking a pool. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS440
00:42:17,00 --> 00:42:21,50
He takes off a shoe. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS441
00:42:24,00 --> 00:42:27,50
Blond arrives. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS442
00:42:28,00 --> 00:42:33,50
He and SOMEONE touch folded arms in a handshake. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS443
00:42:36,00 --> 00:42:40,50
He removes his shirt. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS444
00:42:59,00 --> 00:43:05,50
Blond drops his pants and front flips off the roof. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS445
00:43:04,00 --> 00:43:08,50
He looks up at them with extended arms. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS446
00:43:18,00 --> 00:43:22,50
He takes off. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS447
00:43:21,00 --> 00:43:27,50
SOMEONE lands safely in the pool off a daring back tuck and SOMEONE beams. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS448
00:43:25,00 --> 00:43:29,50
She quickly removes her top. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS449
00:43:30,00 --> 00:43:36,50
SOMEONE leaps feet first into the pool. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS450
00:43:46,00 --> 00:43:53,50
As SOMEONE takes off across the pool, SOMEONE rips off his wet shirt and tosses it aside. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS451
00:43:50,00 --> 00:43:56,50
Swimming underwater, he grabs her ankle and pulls her back. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS452
00:43:54,00 --> 00:44:00,50
SOMEONE passes the lively blonde and beats her to the edge. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS453
00:43:57,00 --> 00:44:02,50
She emerges right in front of him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS454
00:44:10,00 --> 00:44:16,50
Blond watches as SOMEONE playfully splashes SOMEONE and swims off. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS455
00:44:13,00 --> 00:44:18,50
At home, SOMEONE does push-ups. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS456
00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:21,50
His mom enters the living room. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS457
00:44:28,00 --> 00:44:35,50
Later, SOMEONE paddle boards to a navigational buoy far off the coast. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS458
00:44:32,00 --> 00:44:38,50
At home, he crosses week two off his Maverick's chart. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS459
00:44:35,00 --> 00:44:41,50
Now, SOMEONE treads water in a pool, holding a chair above his head. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS460
00:44:44,00 --> 00:44:50,50
SOMEONE casually bites an apple and reads the paper as SOMEONE struggles in the pool. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS461
00:44:48,00 --> 00:44:55,50
Later, SOMEONE starts a timer on his watch and skateboards beside a bus. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS462
00:44:54,00 --> 00:45:02,50
His friend in a hunter's cap skateboards holding onto the moving bus and flashes the surfer a shaka sign. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS463
00:44:59,00 --> 00:45:05,50
Stopping, SOMEONE exhales and checks his watch. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS464
00:45:03,00 --> 00:45:10,50
Outside the school, the young surfer handwrites an essay titled, The Power of Observation. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS465
00:45:08,00 --> 00:45:13,50
SOMEONE sits nearby with a group of students. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS466
00:45:10,00 --> 00:45:16,50
Looking up from the essay, SOMEONE watches her closely. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS467
00:45:13,00 --> 00:45:20,50
A sweet smile spreads his boyish face as she giggles with her friends. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS469
00:45:19,00 --> 00:45:25,50
Later in his room, SOMEONE sits before a typewriter, transcribing his handwritten essay. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS470
00:45:28,00 --> 00:45:32,50
Now he approaches SOMEONE's house. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS471
00:45:32,00 --> 00:45:38,50
SOMEONE pulls the essay from his sweatshirt and hands it to SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS472
00:45:40,00 --> 00:45:45,50
SOMEONE smiles and nods. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS473
00:45:43,00 --> 00:45:48,50
Now, the teen shovels food into his mouth. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS474
00:45:46,00 --> 00:45:54,50
The eight-year-old SOMEONE watches as he piles mashed potatoes onto a roll and stuffs the oversized bite down. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS475
00:45:52,00 --> 00:45:57,50
SOMEONE's wife glances at her husband who raises his brow. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS477
00:45:57,00 --> 00:46:01,50
Holding a half-eaten chicken leg, SOMEONE faces her and smiles. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS478
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:05,50
She grabs a pot from the stove as SOMEONE continues feasting. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS479
00:46:03,00 --> 00:46:09,50
Putting on reading glasses, SOMEONE unfolds the essay. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS480
00:46:06,00 --> 00:46:14,50
SOMEONE notices him reading and focuses on the food as SOMEONE's wife returns with another scoop of potatoes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS482
00:46:14,00 --> 00:46:19,50
SOMEONE turns the page and looks up. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS483
00:46:19,00 --> 00:46:23,50
SOMEONE quickly looks up. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS484
00:46:20,00 --> 00:46:25,50
His wide eyes shift between SOMEONE and the essay. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS485
00:46:27,00 --> 00:46:32,50
SOMEONE's wife eyes her husband then looks down. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS486
00:46:41,00 --> 00:46:46,50
SOMEONE nods and swiftly stands. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS487
00:46:44,00 --> 00:46:49,50
She hugs SOMEONE and leaves the kitchen. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS488
00:46:50,00 --> 00:46:56,50
SOMEONE gazes nervously at SOMEONE's glare and swallows hard. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS489
00:47:00,00 --> 00:47:03,50
He stands up. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS490
00:47:07,00 --> 00:47:13,50
She leaves SOMEONE with the baby and joins SOMEONE in the bedroom. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS491
00:47:40,00 --> 00:47:45,50
Slack jawed, SOMEONE closes his eyes and shakes his head. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS492
00:47:51,00 --> 00:47:55,50
She kneels before SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS493
00:47:53,00 --> 00:47:59,50
Rubbing his arms, she lovingly gazes into his eyes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS494
00:48:06,00 --> 00:48:10,50
She glances toward the kitchen. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS495
00:48:10,00 --> 00:48:15,50
They hurry out of the room to find SOMEONE holding the baby. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS496
00:48:20,00 --> 00:48:24,50
SOMEONE hands baby to her. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS497
00:48:22,00 --> 00:48:27,50
She eyes SOMEONE and leaves them alone. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS498
00:48:24,00 --> 00:48:30,50
SOMEONE shifts his weight anxiously and SOMEONE stares. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS499
00:48:31,00 --> 00:48:36,50
They both take seats at the table. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS501
00:48:53,00 --> 00:48:57,50
The teacher glances at an empty desk. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS502
00:48:56,00 --> 00:49:03,50
On the coastal highway, SOMEONE rides in the bed of an old pickup truck with four labor workers. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS503
00:49:01,00 --> 00:49:05,50
They sit quietly with arms crossed, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS504
00:49:03,00 --> 00:49:07,50
huddling from the chilly wind. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS505
00:49:04,00 --> 00:49:11,50
White surf sweeps along the coast and surrounds a small peninsula. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS506
00:49:20,00 --> 00:49:24,50
SOMEONE takes notes atop the cliff. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS507
00:49:24,00 --> 00:49:28,50
He spots a lone surfer. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS508
00:49:29,00 --> 00:49:32,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS509
00:49:38,00 --> 00:49:43,50
A large wave breaks as SOMEONE focuses. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS510
00:49:48,00 --> 00:49:53,50
SOMEONE's surfing buddy catches a towering wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS511
00:49:50,00 --> 00:49:57,50
SOMEONE smiles enviously as the veteran starts a 30-foot drop. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS512
00:49:58,00 --> 00:50:05,50
The surfer suddenly falls off the board and the colossal wave smashes down on him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS513
00:50:03,00 --> 00:50:08,50
SOMEONE drops his notebook and quickly stands. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS514
00:50:06,00 --> 00:50:12,50
He moves to the cliff's edge, staring out into the frothy white surf. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS515
00:50:15,00 --> 00:50:23,50
The churning wave rapidly sweeps toward the coast and collides with rock formations. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS516
00:50:20,00 --> 00:50:24,50
SOMEONE's mouth falls open. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS517
00:50:22,00 --> 00:50:27,50
The surfer's bright orange board shoots out of the wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS518
00:50:25,00 --> 00:50:33,50
A massive burst of water blasts upward as the wave crashes into more rock formations. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS519
00:50:36,00 --> 00:50:43,50
The young surfer trembles, frantically scanning the seething ocean for SOMEONE's buddy. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS520
00:50:42,00 --> 00:50:49,50
The board lies in a calm spot on the surface as another wave crashes into a large rock. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS521
00:50:47,00 --> 00:50:54,50
The water clears and SOMEONE spots the surfer clutching onto the rock. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS522
00:50:56,00 --> 00:51:02,50
The veteran surfer appears uninjured as he climbs onto the rock's peak. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS523
00:51:00,00 --> 00:51:09,50
Now at home, SOMEONE's observation notes lie strewn on his bed along with ocean maps and various science books. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS524
00:51:06,00 --> 00:51:13,50
The young surfer sits cross-legged, drawing in his private notebook. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS525
00:51:11,00 --> 00:51:18,50
Focusing ardently, SOMEONE puts the finishing touches on a pencil drawn picture. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS527
00:51:19,00 --> 00:51:26,50
A longhaired surfers claws at the air as a beastly octopus clenches him with a tentacle. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS528
00:51:24,00 --> 00:51:29,50
He admires his work and breathes deep. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS530
00:51:27,00 --> 00:51:33,50
SOMEONE rides his bike into SOMEONE's driveway and slides to a stop. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS532
00:51:33,00 --> 00:51:38,50
As he drops an essay in the mailbox, SOMEONE's wife emerges from the garage. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS533
00:51:52,00 --> 00:51:56,50
SOMEONE raises her brow. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS534
00:52:02,00 --> 00:52:07,50
Her lips part as she nods. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS535
00:52:06,00 --> 00:52:11,50
She smiles sweetly and looks off. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS536
00:52:14,00 --> 00:52:18,50
SOMEONE rides off. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS538
00:52:17,00 --> 00:52:22,50
Later at Pleasure Pizza, SOMEONE exits the back door with his bike. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS539
00:52:19,00 --> 00:52:27,50
He sees Blond across the parking lot exchanging a small plastic bag for money with a scowling bully. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS540
00:52:25,00 --> 00:52:29,50
The bully spots SOMEONE and nods. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS541
00:52:35,00 --> 00:52:42,50
Blond approaches the door as the bully drives off and SOMEONE blocks him with his bike. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS542
00:52:48,00 --> 00:52:52,50
Blond's smile fades. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS543
00:52:53,00 --> 00:52:57,50
He tosses Blond the keys. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS544
00:52:55,00 --> 00:53:00,50
They make brief eye contact, then SOMEONE rides away. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS545
00:52:58,00 --> 00:53:04,50
Now, he arrives home and slides to a stop in his dirt driveway. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS547
00:53:03,00 --> 00:53:09,50
At his desk, the young surfer pulls out the cigar box and turns on a lamp. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS549
00:53:08,00 --> 00:53:14,50
Holding a handful of dollar bills, SOMEONE eyes a print ad for $89 weather radio. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS550
00:53:12,00 --> 00:53:19,50
He presses his thumb against the ad and looks down at the unopened envelope from his father. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS551
00:53:18,00 --> 00:53:23,50
SOMEONE grabs the letter and gazes longingly then turns it over in the box. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS553
00:53:24,00 --> 00:53:29,50
He shoves the money inside and closes it. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS554
00:53:27,00 --> 00:53:32,50
Now his mom arrives home from work. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS556
00:53:36,00 --> 00:53:41,50
She tosses her purse and keys down then removes her coat. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS557
00:53:41,00 --> 00:53:47,50
SOMEONE enters the bathroom and notices the bathtub full of water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS558
00:53:46,00 --> 00:53:51,50
As she reaches for the faucet, SOMEONE bursts out. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS559
00:53:55,00 --> 00:54:02,50
Later, he crosses week four off the chart and colors the breath-holding graph just under two minutes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS560
00:54:03,00 --> 00:54:09,50
SOMEONE carefully pins a surfing poster over his Maverick's chart. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS561
00:54:27,00 --> 00:54:32,50
She rubs her wrist anxiously as SOMEONE stares off. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS562
00:54:31,00 --> 00:54:37,50
He pulls the cigar box from the drawer and grabs his wad of cash. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS563
00:54:35,00 --> 00:54:41,50
SOMEONE saunters toward her son as he counts out one-dollar bills. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS564
00:54:41,00 --> 00:54:46,50
He stares at his hard-earned money. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS565
00:54:44,00 --> 00:54:48,50
SOMEONE holds out the cash. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS566
00:54:47,00 --> 00:54:52,50
His mom snatches it and turns. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS567
00:54:49,00 --> 00:54:54,50
SOMEONE's sad eyes shift about as she leaves. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS568
00:54:55,00 --> 00:55:02,50
Now a park features an overlook where waves crash against the base of steep cliffs. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS569
00:54:59,00 --> 00:55:04,50
A warning sign stands at their edge. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS570
00:55:02,00 --> 00:55:11,50
Clad in a wetsuit and carrying a surfboard, SOMEONE climbs over a barrier fence and takes a seat next to a brooding Blond. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS571
00:55:20,00 --> 00:55:28,50
Paddling on a surfboard, the scowling boy faces a wave, bites his lip, and picks up his pace. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS572
00:55:26,00 --> 00:55:33,50
Standing at the top of a wave, SOMEONE shoves another surfer forcing him off his board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS573
00:55:36,00 --> 00:55:41,50
SOMEONE surfs the wave just ahead of the white water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS574
00:55:54,00 --> 00:56:01,50
SOMEONE clasps his friend's hand, hauls him to his feet, and gently taps his stomach with his board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS575
00:55:59,00 --> 00:56:05,50
In churning water, a surfing SOMEONE glances over his shoulder. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS576
00:56:02,00 --> 00:56:09,50
On the ridge, SOMEONE takes a running start and leaps from the edge. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS577
00:56:06,00 --> 00:56:12,50
He plummets 30 feet to the breakers below. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS578
00:56:09,00 --> 00:56:14,50
Surfacing, he shakes out his curls. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS579
00:56:11,00 --> 00:56:17,50
Blond lingers on the cliff, watching his friend inscrutably. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS580
00:56:15,00 --> 00:56:22,50
SOMEONE paddles over a misty sunlit wave and joins up with the other surfers. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS581
00:56:20,00 --> 00:56:25,50
SOMEONE regards him with a weary sneer. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS583
00:56:24,00 --> 00:56:29,50
Eyeing a wave, SOMEONE turns and paddles along with it. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS584
00:56:30,00 --> 00:56:35,50
He pops up as it crests beneath him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS585
00:56:32,00 --> 00:56:41,50
SOMEONE's board leaves a white wake as he surfs along the face, executing tight curls at the crest. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS586
00:56:39,00 --> 00:56:47,50
From the lookout point, SOMEONE snacks on sunflower seeds as he watches the teen. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS587
00:56:46,00 --> 00:56:52,50
Skirting the white water, SOMEONE executes a 360. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS588
00:56:50,00 --> 00:56:55,50
Frowning resentfully, SOMEONE paddles away. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS589
00:56:53,00 --> 00:57:00,50
Blond watches with a faint hard smile as the bully claims a wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS590
00:56:57,00 --> 00:57:02,50
SOMEONE carves his way up and down the face. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS591
00:57:08,00 --> 00:57:14,50
As the white water catches up to him, he waves SOMEONE on daringly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS592
00:57:17,00 --> 00:57:23,50
With a good-natured smile, SOMEONE paddles back out toward the waves. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS593
00:57:26,00 --> 00:57:31,50
From the lookout, SOMEONE watches him intently. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS594
00:57:29,00 --> 00:57:34,50
SOMEONE paddles along the top of a wave then pops up at its crest. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS596
00:57:33,00 --> 00:57:40,50
The gifted teen surfs along its face, trailing his fingertips through the green water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS597
00:57:39,00 --> 00:57:46,50
He carves up the wave, descends to the base, then rides up the face for another turn. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS598
00:57:46,00 --> 00:57:53,50
SOMEONE allows the white water to surround him, then crouches low and glides out of it. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS599
00:57:53,00 --> 00:58:00,50
SOMEONE watches jealously as SOMEONE allows a faint proud smile. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS601
00:58:02,00 --> 00:58:08,50
Back on the wave's face, SOMEONE executes a 180 at the crest. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS602
00:58:09,00 --> 00:58:17,50
As the white water converges around him, he leaps from his board and dives head first into the water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS603
00:58:14,00 --> 00:58:18,50
On the high ridge, Blond pumps his fists. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS605
00:58:20,00 --> 00:58:27,50
SOMEONE seethes on his board as SOMEONE joyfully surfaces and shakes his hair out. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS606
00:58:27,00 --> 00:58:33,50
With a satisfied smile, SOMEONE steps away from the overlook. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS607
00:58:31,00 --> 00:58:38,50
Now SOMEONE runs a hand through her hair as she walks up the walk to her front door. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS608
00:58:36,00 --> 00:58:41,50
Opening it, she pauses and listens. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS610
00:58:41,00 --> 00:58:48,50
Coming in, she glances down the hall and finds no sign of anyone. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS611
00:58:45,00 --> 00:58:52,50
She moves to the kitchen and finds SOMEONE and SOMEONE renovating the cabinets. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS612
00:58:49,00 --> 00:58:54,50
Seeing her, SOMEONE pauses. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS614
00:58:54,00 --> 00:59:01,50
As SOMEONE beams lovingly, he removes his goggles, steps on a foot switch, and lowers a paper facemask. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS615
00:59:05,00 --> 00:59:11,50
SOMEONE rolls his eyes and faces SOMEONE whose smile vanishes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS616
00:59:09,00 --> 00:59:13,50
The older man smiles at SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS617
00:59:13,00 --> 00:59:18,50
His brow furrowed, he gives a nod. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS619
00:59:24,00 --> 00:59:28,50
Now at Pleasure Pizza's counter, SOMEONE and his buddies come in. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS620
00:59:25,00 --> 00:59:31,50
He staggers drunkenly while his friends rough house. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS621
00:59:57,00 --> 01:00:02,50
SOMEONE marches behind the counter and attacks Blond. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS622
00:59:59,00 --> 01:00:05,50
SOMEONE struggles to pull him off and raises a fist. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS623
01:00:02,00 --> 01:00:07,50
SOMEONE's buddies restrain him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS624
01:00:16,00 --> 01:00:21,50
He knocks a bell off the counter. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS625
01:00:24,00 --> 01:00:29,50
As they leave, Blond rubs his throat. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS626
01:00:26,00 --> 01:00:32,50
SOMEONE finds a roll of cash on the floor and thrusts it as his chest. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS627
01:00:32,00 --> 01:00:37,50
He steps away and Blond shifts his guilty gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS628
01:00:35,00 --> 01:00:41,50
Now SOMEONE's van travels up a winding road in a light fog. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS630
01:00:40,00 --> 01:00:45,50
Riding shotgun, SOMEONE stares out his window broodingly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS631
01:00:42,00 --> 01:00:48,50
SOMEONE takes the essay from his pocket and sets it on the tray. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS632
01:00:53,00 --> 01:00:59,50
SOMEONE faces his mentor with wide eyes and finds him beaming. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS633
01:00:58,00 --> 01:01:04,50
Now at Mavericks, SOMEONE and SOMEONE stand in a small fishing boat. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS634
01:01:37,00 --> 01:01:43,50
Now, SOMEONE and SOMEONE plunge into the water wearing diving masks, suits, and flippers. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS636
01:01:44,00 --> 01:01:48,50
The paddle down to a reef. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS637
01:01:55,00 --> 01:02:00,50
SOMEONE curls in his ring finger. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS638
01:02:05,00 --> 01:02:11,50
They pause among giant knobs of coral growth. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS639
01:02:08,00 --> 01:02:13,50
SOMEONE checks his wristwatch. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS640
01:02:11,00 --> 01:02:16,50
Facing SOMEONE, he jerks his thumb upward. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS641
01:02:14,00 --> 01:02:19,50
Lifting his contented gaze, the teen does a double take. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS643
01:02:17,00 --> 01:02:22,50
A great white shark swims above them. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS645
01:02:22,00 --> 01:02:26,50
As SOMEONE watches it calmly, SOMEONE flails his arms and recoils. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS646
01:02:24,00 --> 01:02:30,50
The shark turns, giving a view of its glassy black eyes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS648
01:02:29,00 --> 01:02:35,50
Noticing SOMEONE's rising panic, SOMEONE turns the boy to face him and gives calming gestures. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS649
01:02:33,00 --> 01:02:38,50
Large air bubbles escape from the teen's mouth. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS650
01:02:36,00 --> 01:02:43,50
SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE looks up at the shark again and exhales more air. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS652
01:02:42,00 --> 01:02:48,50
As the creature swims away, the mentor grabs the teen and urges him up toward the surface. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS653
01:02:47,00 --> 01:02:55,50
As SOMEONE grabs onto the boat's diving step, its grizzled owner cocks a gun from the deck. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS654
01:02:56,00 --> 01:03:00,50
The teen edges back against the cabin. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS655
01:02:58,00 --> 01:03:05,50
Climbing on board, SOMEONE removes his mask and faces his breathless protege. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS656
01:03:48,00 --> 01:03:55,50
As SOMEONE steps away, SOMEONE warms his hands under his arms and shifts his thoughtful gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS657
01:03:53,00 --> 01:03:59,50
Now at home, he types out the first words of an essay entitled, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS659
01:03:57,00 --> 01:04:02,50
He taps the keys with two fingers. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS660
01:04:00,00 --> 01:04:06,50
Now at school, a wall clock read 8:48. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS661
01:04:11,00 --> 01:04:15,50
Watching the clock, SOMEONE holds his breath. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS662
01:04:18,00 --> 01:04:24,50
With a pencil, he makes a third SOMEONE on his notepaper. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS663
01:04:27,00 --> 01:04:32,50
SOMEONE passes out, landing in a heap beside his desk. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS664
01:04:31,00 --> 01:04:36,50
The teacher regards him with a concerned gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS665
01:04:33,00 --> 01:04:39,50
At night, SOMEONE takes out the trash behind Pleasure Pizza. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS666
01:04:36,00 --> 01:04:42,50
A large group of teens ride past on bicycles. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS668
01:04:40,00 --> 01:04:45,50
Spotting SOMEONE, SOMEONE splits off and rides over. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS670
01:05:09,00 --> 01:05:15,50
SOMEONE leans behind the counter and grabs his stuff. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS671
01:05:18,00 --> 01:05:24,50
Blond glares after him, then spies SOMEONE's notebook on the floor. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS672
01:05:24,00 --> 01:05:29,50
He opens it and flips through the pages. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS673
01:05:27,00 --> 01:05:32,50
Blond peruses his friend's surfing related sketches 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS674
01:05:29,00 --> 01:05:35,50
then comes across a page filled with handwriting and halts. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS675
01:05:33,00 --> 01:05:39,50
Now SOMEONE's van pulls up outside him home, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS676
01:05:36,00 --> 01:05:41,50
its headlights cutting through the dark. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS677
01:05:38,00 --> 01:05:45,50
In the kitchen, SOMEONE shuts a cabinet, a dishtowel in her free hand. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS678
01:06:02,00 --> 01:06:06,50
He pulls out books. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS679
01:06:08,00 --> 01:06:12,50
His wife smiles. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS680
01:06:11,00 --> 01:06:18,50
She watches with glistening eyes as SOMEONE shuffles to a partially open door at the end of the hall. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS681
01:06:20,00 --> 01:06:25,50
Now, SOMEONE and SOMEONE carry surfboards. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS682
01:06:27,00 --> 01:06:32,50
Nearing a rocky shore, SOMEONE pauses and looks back at her. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS684
01:06:32,00 --> 01:06:37,50
Stopping on the winding path, SOMEONE smiles and follows him onward. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS685
01:06:34,00 --> 01:06:40,50
Now, stars twinkle in a clear night sky. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS686
01:06:47,00 --> 01:06:53,50
Standing at SOMEONE's side, SOMEONE beams at him affectionately. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS687
01:07:07,00 --> 01:07:12,50
SOMEONE returns his solemn gaze to the sky. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS688
01:07:09,00 --> 01:07:15,50
SOMEONE's smile fades and she regards him compassionately. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS689
01:07:13,00 --> 01:07:18,50
Facing her, SOMEONE smiles and shrugs it off. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS690
01:07:18,00 --> 01:07:24,50
Now, pitch-black waves send up snow-white foam as they break. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS691
01:07:22,00 --> 01:07:28,50
Wearing wetsuits, SOMEONE and SOMEONE paddle out on their surfboards. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS692
01:07:25,00 --> 01:07:31,50
They ascend a cresting wave and ride down the other side. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS693
01:07:29,00 --> 01:07:36,50
Now, SOMEONE stands while SOMEONE rides the wave on her belly beside him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS694
01:07:34,00 --> 01:07:38,50
She gets to her feet. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS695
01:07:37,00 --> 01:07:42,50
SOMEONE surfs his board close to hers and reaches out. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS696
01:07:39,00 --> 01:07:44,50
The two join hands. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS697
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:46,50
Losing their balance, they fall off their boards. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS698
01:07:44,00 --> 01:07:49,50
SOMEONE surfaces with SOMEONE and shakes his hair out. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS699
01:07:47,00 --> 01:07:53,50
The blonde beauty grins joyfully and gives him a playful splash. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS700
01:07:52,00 --> 01:08:00,50
Now, SOMEONE and SOMEONE propel their paddleboards over sunlit glassy waters hued a deep peacock blue. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS701
01:08:13,00 --> 01:08:19,50
The two pause and sit up, straddling their boards. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS702
01:08:16,00 --> 01:08:21,50
SOMEONE trails his fingertips through the water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS703
01:08:52,00 --> 01:08:57,50
Squinting in the sunlight, SOMEONE sips from his water bottle. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS704
01:09:06,00 --> 01:09:11,50
From underwater, we gaze up at the seasoned surfer. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS705
01:09:13,00 --> 01:09:18,50
Its rippling surface distorts his appreciative gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS706
01:09:16,00 --> 01:09:21,50
Now the two walk along a misty isolated beach. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS707
01:09:42,00 --> 01:09:47,50
SOMEONE nods emphatically. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS708
01:10:01,00 --> 01:10:07,50
Now, the light of a low sun casts a rosy glow on the waves. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS709
01:10:05,00 --> 01:10:13,50
At night, SOMEONE and SOMEONE dance together by a campfire as two women sing and play ukuleles. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS710
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:16,50
SOMEONE beams as she watches her parents. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS711
01:10:14,00 --> 01:10:19,50
Perched in a portable chair, SOMEONE looks on appreciatively. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS713
01:10:18,00 --> 01:10:24,50
Holding each other close, SOMEONE and SOMEONE gaze into each other's eyes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS714
01:10:21,00 --> 01:10:26,50
He kisses her lips and dips her. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS715
01:10:40,00 --> 01:10:44,50
SOMEONE takes SOMEONE's hand. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS716
01:10:42,00 --> 01:10:46,50
SOMEONE sits with SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS717
01:11:34,00 --> 01:11:41,50
Facing forward, SOMEONE spies SOMEONE hiking up from the water with a fishing pole in one hand and a huge fish in the other. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS719
01:11:58,00 --> 01:12:04,50
SOMEONE springs from her chair and he chases her off across the sand. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS721
01:12:04,00 --> 01:12:09,50
Now at a section of the school overlooking the ocean, SOMEONE arrives with friends and joins a group. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS722
01:12:09,00 --> 01:12:14,50
Sitting yards away, SOMEONE stands eagerly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS723
01:12:12,00 --> 01:12:18,50
SOMEONE greets a few friends then turns and notices him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS724
01:12:15,00 --> 01:12:20,50
He lifts his hand in a wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS725
01:12:17,00 --> 01:12:22,50
Her smile fades and she averts her gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS727
01:12:21,00 --> 01:12:26,50
SOMEONE's brow knits and he blinks at her woundedly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS728
01:12:24,00 --> 01:12:30,50
Now, autumn leaves cover the back patio of the abandoned house. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS729
01:12:28,00 --> 01:12:35,50
Arriving with his skateboard, SOMEONE finds Blond lounging in the pool with the kid in a hunter's cap, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS730
01:12:36,00 --> 01:12:40,50
SOMEONE and his friends. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS731
01:12:39,00 --> 01:12:44,50
SOMEONE removes his backpack and faces his friend. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS732
01:12:53,00 --> 01:12:58,50
SOMEONE picks up SOMEONE's notebook. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS733
01:12:55,00 --> 01:13:00,50
Sneering, he opens it and reads. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS734
01:13:08,00 --> 01:13:14,50
SOMEONE faces Blond who returns his gaze remorselessly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS735
01:13:14,00 --> 01:13:19,50
SOMEONE tosses the notebook over and it lands in the dirt. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS736
01:13:24,00 --> 01:13:28,50
His cheeks flushed, SOMEONE lowers his humiliated gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS738
01:13:27,00 --> 01:13:33,50
Blond picks at a tennis ball and he eyes his friend coldly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS739
01:13:31,00 --> 01:13:36,50
SOMEONE backs away from him and picks up the notebook. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS740
01:13:34,00 --> 01:13:39,50
Steeling himself, he walks past the bullies. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS741
01:13:42,00 --> 01:13:50,50
At an isolated nighttime beach, SOMEONE crouches over his surfboard and waxes it aggressively. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS742
01:13:51,00 --> 01:13:57,50
Later, his board rests on a chair outside as he comes in. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS743
01:13:55,00 --> 01:13:59,50
Shuffling through the kitchen, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS744
01:13:56,00 --> 01:14:02,50
he puts on his wristwatch and notices a stack of mail on the table. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS746
01:14:01,00 --> 01:14:08,50
Amid the envelopes, he finds one with his name scrawled in red ink beside SOMEONE's crossed out name. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS748
01:14:07,00 --> 01:14:13,50
He finds a single notation at the top of his latest essay. "Go deeper." 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS750
01:14:12,00 --> 01:14:19,50
Now, SOMEONE marches into SOMEONE's shed where his mentor tends to a board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS751
01:14:16,00 --> 01:14:20,50
He tosses down the envelope. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS752
01:15:18,00 --> 01:15:22,50
SOMEONE runs in. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS753
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:29,50
Following her into the kitchen, SOMEONE and SOMEONE find SOMEONE sprawled on the floor. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS754
01:15:29,00 --> 01:15:33,50
SOMEONE rushes to her. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS755
01:15:34,00 --> 01:15:39,50
SOMEONE cradles her as SOMEONE rushes to a phone. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS756
01:15:55,00 --> 01:16:00,50
Her face pale, SOMEONE stares off. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS757
01:15:59,00 --> 01:16:04,50
SOMEONE cradles her head. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS758
01:16:04,00 --> 01:16:11,50
Now, the sun shines wanly through a thick haze and gleams on a calm grey sea. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS759
01:16:09,00 --> 01:16:15,50
Wearing a black suit, SOMEONE stares out at the water with a knitted brow. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS761
01:16:14,00 --> 01:16:19,50
Also in black, SOMEONE jogs out from a church and looks around. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS763
01:16:18,00 --> 01:16:23,50
Passing arriving mourners, the teen spots his mentor across the street. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS764
01:16:21,00 --> 01:16:25,50
SOMEONE arrives in a dark green jeep. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS766
01:16:25,00 --> 01:16:31,50
Glancing toward SOMEONE, SOMEONE approaches the pretty teen who wears an anguished gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS767
01:16:32,00 --> 01:16:36,50
SOMEONE shakes his head. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS768
01:16:33,00 --> 01:16:38,50
Catching sight of SOMEONE, he bites his lip. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS769
01:16:42,00 --> 01:16:48,50
SOMEONE regards her grieving friend with glistening eyes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS770
01:16:47,00 --> 01:16:52,50
She gives an understanding nod. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS771
01:16:49,00 --> 01:16:53,50
Taking deep breaths, SOMEONE marches off. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS773
01:16:53,00 --> 01:16:59,50
SOMEONE looks over her shoulder and finds him approaching his mentor. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS774
01:16:57,00 --> 01:17:04,50
SOMEONE stands with both hands braced on a railing, his tie slightly loosened. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS775
01:17:02,00 --> 01:17:08,50
SOMEONE fiddles with his wristwatch as he nears his heartbroken friend. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS776
01:17:05,00 --> 01:17:10,50
Keeping his gaze fixed ahead, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS777
01:17:07,00 --> 01:17:11,50
SOMEONE works his mouth. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS778
01:17:11,00 --> 01:17:15,50
His jaw clenches. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS779
01:17:14,00 --> 01:17:19,50
The teen turns and takes a few steps back 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS780
01:17:16,00 --> 01:17:20,50
but lingers nearby. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS781
01:17:20,00 --> 01:17:26,50
A tall bald man with a white mustache comes over. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS782
01:17:23,00 --> 01:17:29,50
He steps up beside SOMEONE and faces him expectantly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS783
01:17:50,00 --> 01:17:56,50
His brow furrowed, the older man turns his face toward the water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS784
01:17:54,00 --> 01:17:58,50
SOMEONE's eyes well with tears. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS785
01:18:03,00 --> 01:18:08,50
SOMEONE gives a sorrowful nod and faces the older man. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS786
01:18:19,00 --> 01:18:23,50
As the older man leaves, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS787
01:18:20,00 --> 01:18:25,50
SOMEONE stares at his mentor helplessly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS788
01:18:24,00 --> 01:18:29,50
Later, the teen enters his dark house. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS790
01:18:31,00 --> 01:18:35,50
In bed, SOMEONE lies on her back. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS791
01:18:32,00 --> 01:18:38,50
As SOMEONE comes in and sits on the edge of her mattress, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS792
01:18:35,00 --> 01:18:39,50
she scoots over to make room for him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS793
01:18:37,00 --> 01:18:42,50
The teen shifts his pensive gaze then lies down beside his mother. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS795
01:18:44,00 --> 01:18:50,50
Stare at the ceiling, their hands folded over their chests. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS796
01:18:55,00 --> 01:19:00,50
SOMEONE's chest sags in a deep sigh. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS797
01:18:58,00 --> 01:19:03,50
She rolls over to face her son. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS798
01:19:06,00 --> 01:19:12,50
On an overcast day, SOMEONE brings a pizza to SOMEONE's house. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS799
01:19:09,00 --> 01:19:15,50
He steps through the wide-open gate and swings it shut behind him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS800
01:19:13,00 --> 01:19:19,50
Finding the front door standing ajar, he calls inside. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS801
01:19:21,00 --> 01:19:25,50
He brings the pizza in. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS802
01:19:24,00 --> 01:19:28,50
He turns and his eyes widen. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS803
01:19:26,00 --> 01:19:33,50
The kitchen stands in shambles, the cabinets heavily battered and torn from their hinges. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS804
01:19:30,00 --> 01:19:35,50
SOMEONE shifts his bewildered gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS805
01:19:33,00 --> 01:19:39,50
Stepping outside, he approaches the shed and peers in with a worried gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS806
01:19:37,00 --> 01:19:46,50
In one corner, and empty armchair faces a TV that plays a home movie of SOMEONE with one of her babies. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS807
01:19:48,00 --> 01:19:54,50
SOMEONE notices an empty water bottle on the floor beside a broken rack rod. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS808
01:19:52,00 --> 01:19:57,50
Looking up, he finds one of the paddleboards gone. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS809
01:19:55,00 --> 01:20:02,50
SOMEONE hurriedly takes down the other board, ducks down, and carries it from the shed. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS810
01:19:59,00 --> 01:20:04,50
Now he paddles over the water speedily. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS811
01:20:09,00 --> 01:20:15,50
His board glides swiftly over the gently rolling water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS812
01:20:14,00 --> 01:20:19,50
SOMEONE looks around anxiously and shakes water from his hair. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS813
01:20:19,00 --> 01:20:25,50
The surrounding current shows no sign of his grieving mentor. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS814
01:20:22,00 --> 01:20:30,50
SOMEONE gets up on his knees, bends over, and paddles both hands in synchronized strokes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS815
01:20:33,00 --> 01:20:38,50
We peer at the seemingly endless expanse. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS816
01:20:40,00 --> 01:20:45,50
Pausing, SOMEONE looks around helplessly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS817
01:20:43,00 --> 01:20:51,50
The teen pants hard and swigs from his water bottle, then angrily throws down its cap. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS818
01:20:50,00 --> 01:20:54,50
His gaze fixes on it. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS819
01:20:52,00 --> 01:20:58,50
As the current carries the plastic cap away, SOMEONE's eyes widen. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS820
01:21:01,00 --> 01:21:09,50
SOMEONE flattens himself on his stomach and paddles in the direction of the softly rippling waves. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS821
01:21:06,00 --> 01:21:12,50
A lone dark shape appears on the water ahead. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS822
01:21:11,00 --> 01:21:18,50
Kneeling, SOMEONE picks up the pace and paddles with both hands in synchronized stokes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS823
01:21:15,00 --> 01:21:22,50
Drawing near, he finds his mentor sprawled out on his board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS824
01:21:19,00 --> 01:21:24,50
SOMEONE's board roughly bumps his on arrival. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS825
01:21:30,00 --> 01:21:35,50
SOMEONE shifts his bewildered gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS826
01:21:33,00 --> 01:21:37,50
His expression anguished, his mentor turns his face away. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS828
01:22:06,00 --> 01:22:11,50
SOMEONE stares at his protege appreciatively. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS829
01:22:12,00 --> 01:22:16,50
SOMEONE offers him water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS830
01:22:16,00 --> 01:22:20,50
SOMEONE takes it and sips. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS832
01:22:29,00 --> 01:22:34,50
His bleary, SOMEONE twists around and looks over his shoulder. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS833
01:22:32,00 --> 01:22:37,50
Spying hills in the hazy distance, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS834
01:22:34,00 --> 01:22:40,50
he faces his protege with a surprised delighted smile. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS835
01:22:39,00 --> 01:22:46,50
The youth stretches out on his stomach and heads for the distant shore. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS836
01:22:43,00 --> 01:22:48,50
His mentor follows closely. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS837
01:22:46,00 --> 01:22:52,50
Now, pebbles dot a sandy beach nestled at the base of rocky hills. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS838
01:22:50,00 --> 01:22:59,50
Rustic houses and a patio decorated with colorful fishing buoys form a barrier around the secluded spot. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS839
01:22:56,00 --> 01:23:05,50
Our view drifts past the two paddleboards to find SOMEONE and SOMEONE sitting side by side, enjoying their accomplishment. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS841
01:23:04,00 --> 01:23:12,50
Now in his room, SOMEONE uses a blue marker to fill the remaining empty space in the miles bar on his poster of training goals. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS842
01:23:10,00 --> 01:23:16,50
Going to the kitchen, he finds SOMEONE making breakfast. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS843
01:23:16,00 --> 01:23:21,50
He pauses at her tidy appearance. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS844
01:23:18,00 --> 01:23:22,50
She gestures to the table. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS845
01:23:21,00 --> 01:23:26,50
A colorfully wrapped present sits by a place setting. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS846
01:23:29,00 --> 01:23:34,50
SOMEONE holds out cash. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS847
01:23:32,00 --> 01:23:37,50
SOMEONE takes the money uneasily. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS848
01:23:34,00 --> 01:23:40,50
SOMEONE strides back to the stove and resumes cooking. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS849
01:23:44,00 --> 01:23:48,50
SOMEONE's eyes widen. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS850
01:23:45,00 --> 01:23:50,50
Grinning proudly, SOMEONE pours orange juice. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS851
01:23:50,00 --> 01:23:56,50
Yielding a smile, the teen goes to the table and sits. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS852
01:23:54,00 --> 01:24:00,50
His beaming mother looks on as she scoops scrambled eggs from a pan. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS853
01:23:58,00 --> 01:24:04,50
Tearing off the wrapping paper, SOMEONE reveals a weather radio. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS854
01:24:05,00 --> 01:24:10,50
SOMEONE takes it from its box with a stunned gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS855
01:24:18,00 --> 01:24:22,50
She brings him breakfast. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS856
01:24:32,00 --> 01:24:37,50
SOMEONE regards his smiling mother appreciatively. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS857
01:24:36,00 --> 01:24:40,50
He gets up from his seat. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS859
01:24:38,00 --> 01:24:43,50
He kneels close to hers, and gives her an emotional hug. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS861
01:24:42,00 --> 01:24:46,50
Her brow furrowed, SOMEONE holds him tight. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS862
01:24:45,00 --> 01:24:50,50
The teen blinks back tears. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS863
01:24:48,00 --> 01:24:55,50
Now beneath a stormy sky, slate hued waves roil and churn along the coast, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS864
01:24:52,00 --> 01:24:57,50
crashing violently into its rocks. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS865
01:24:55,00 --> 01:25:01,50
At the swimming pool, rain pelts the concrete patio. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS867
01:25:00,00 --> 01:25:04,50
At a nine foot depth marker, a bubble erupts at the surface. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS869
01:25:03,00 --> 01:25:08,50
Kneeling underwater, SOMEONE holds up a single finger. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS870
01:25:05,00 --> 01:25:11,50
An occasional air bubble slips between his lips 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS871
01:25:08,00 --> 01:25:13,50
but he maintains a serene expression. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS872
01:25:10,00 --> 01:25:16,50
He curls in his finger, surfaces and checks his watch. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS873
01:25:13,00 --> 01:25:19,50
Its timer reads four minutes and five seconds. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS875
01:25:18,00 --> 01:25:23,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE enter a shop. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS876
01:25:21,00 --> 01:25:25,50
A square faced man greets them. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS877
01:25:37,00 --> 01:25:41,50
He leads them down a corridor. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS878
01:25:47,00 --> 01:25:54,50
Following them, SOMEONE steps into a room with a gorgeously painted long board at its center. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS880
01:26:01,00 --> 01:26:05,50
The teen stares at it with an overwhelmed gaze then ventures closer. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS881
01:26:07,00 --> 01:26:14,50
Peering at the green tipped board, he glides a hand over its lemon yellow body, appreciating the curves of its design. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS883
01:26:14,00 --> 01:26:22,50
His hand trails toward the front where the yellow hue blends into a deep red, resembling a sunset. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS884
01:26:26,00 --> 01:26:31,50
SOMEONE clasps SOMEONE's hand. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS885
01:26:29,00 --> 01:26:34,50
Now, a wetsuit-clad figure treads churning water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS886
01:26:32,00 --> 01:26:38,50
Above the surface, a green wave crashes powerfully. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS887
01:26:35,00 --> 01:26:43,50
Silhouetted against the blue sky, SOMEONE and his three surfing buddies gaze out at the water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS888
01:26:40,00 --> 01:26:45,50
The swimming figure surfaces at the foot of a wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS889
01:26:46,00 --> 01:26:53,50
As SOMEONE smiles proudly, SOMEONE allows one wave after another to crash down on him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS890
01:26:51,00 --> 01:26:58,50
Beside the mentor, a friend of his with weathered features peers through narrowed eyes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS891
01:27:03,00 --> 01:27:09,50
Out in the water, SOMEONE submerges himself in a wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS892
01:27:11,00 --> 01:27:16,50
Squinting in the sun, his shortest friend wears a knit cap. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS893
01:27:20,00 --> 01:27:27,50
As a giant wave rolls over the teen, a surfing buddy with longer hair faces SOMEONE solemnly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS894
01:27:29,00 --> 01:27:34,50
Now, SOMEONE listens to his weather radio at work. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS895
01:27:48,00 --> 01:27:54,50
SOMEONE switches off his radio and leaves the deserted after-hours kitchen. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS896
01:27:52,00 --> 01:27:57,50
Unlocking the front door, he lets SOMEONE inside. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS898
01:28:00,00 --> 01:28:05,50
She steps in past him, halts, then lowers the hood of her raincoat. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS899
01:28:07,00 --> 01:28:11,50
She wears a troubled gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS900
01:28:08,00 --> 01:28:12,50
Turning away, she sinks down to the floor. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS901
01:28:09,00 --> 01:28:15,50
she sinks down to the floor and leans her back against a booth seat. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS902
01:28:17,00 --> 01:28:21,50
SOMEONE joins her on the floor. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS903
01:28:43,00 --> 01:28:48,50
SOMEONE gives a sad smile. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS904
01:29:11,00 --> 01:29:16,50
SOMEONE stares breathlessly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS906
01:29:19,00 --> 01:29:25,50
He stares at her imploringly but find her gaze confused. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS907
01:29:23,00 --> 01:29:27,50
SOMEONE leans in close. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS909
01:29:25,00 --> 01:29:30,50
SOMEONE follows his example. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS910
01:29:27,00 --> 01:29:32,50
Their lips meet in a tender kiss. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS913
01:29:32,00 --> 01:29:36,50
As they part, She then kisses him again. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS914
01:29:37,00 --> 01:29:44,50
Now, a wave several stories tall fills our view as it continues to gather mass. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS915
01:29:42,00 --> 01:29:50,50
It curls into a barrel as it breaks and sends up massive blasts of foam and spray. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS916
01:29:50,00 --> 01:29:54,50
The sea churns violently in its wake. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS917
01:29:52,00 --> 01:29:58,50
Now, SOMEONE's surfing gear lies neatly on his bed. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS918
01:29:55,00 --> 01:30:01,50
The teen takes in his inventory with deep nervous breaths. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS919
01:29:59,00 --> 01:30:06,50
His gaze lifts to his drawing of a giant tentacle dragging a man down into the sea. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS920
01:30:07,00 --> 01:30:12,50
SOMEONE's eyes dart toward his cigar box. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS921
01:30:12,00 --> 01:30:18,50
Crossing the room, he flips open the lid and dumps out its contents. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS922
01:30:16,00 --> 01:30:22,50
Plucking out the envelope, he rips it open and reads the letter within. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS923
01:30:22,00 --> 01:30:28,50
His jaw muscles tense as he peruses his father's words. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS924
01:30:26,00 --> 01:30:31,50
The teen lifts his disillusioned gaze and swallows. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS925
01:30:31,00 --> 01:30:36,50
Now, SOMEONE types out, "Dear Frosty." 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS927
01:30:37,00 --> 01:30:41,50
He pauses thoughtfully then proceeds with a resolute glare. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS928
01:30:42,00 --> 01:30:49,50
Now, from overhead, we follow a giant wave as it rolls along the water toward the bluffs. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS929
01:30:53,00 --> 01:30:59,50
Camped out on his couch, SOMEONE rushes to the phone and answers it. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS930
01:31:07,00 --> 01:31:12,50
SOMEONE steps out, wrapping herself in a sweater. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS931
01:31:10,00 --> 01:31:15,50
Ending the call, he notices her nervous gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS932
01:31:13,00 --> 01:31:17,50
She musters a smile. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS934
01:31:20,00 --> 01:31:24,50
she gives an encouraging nod. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS935
01:31:22,00 --> 01:31:27,50
Now, SOMEONE's van travels up the ocean side highway. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS936
01:31:41,00 --> 01:31:47,50
He shows SOMEONE a surfing magazine exposing the existence of Mavericks. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS937
01:31:45,00 --> 01:31:50,50
In the back. SOMEONE naps against SOMEONE's shoulder. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS938
01:31:58,00 --> 01:32:03,50
His face pale, SOMEONE pants and blinks queasily. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS939
01:32:04,00 --> 01:32:10,50
As the van pulls over on the shoulder, SOMEONE rushes out. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS940
01:32:12,00 --> 01:32:20,50
Now, the sun shines brightly on a slate blue sea rolling beyond the meteorological complex. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS941
01:32:18,00 --> 01:32:26,50
A wave the size of a large house curls into a barrel, filling our view with its snow-white foam. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS942
01:32:25,00 --> 01:32:32,50
From a makeshift parking area, countless surfers and spectators make their way toward the beach. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS943
01:32:30,00 --> 01:32:38,50
Taking his new surfboard down from the van's roof, SOMEONE pauses at the sight of Blond approaching. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS944
01:32:40,00 --> 01:32:46,50
Behind him, SOMEONE bundles up his beaming daughter as SOMEONE looks on. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS945
01:32:44,00 --> 01:32:48,50
Blond taps a buddy on the arm. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS946
01:33:11,00 --> 01:33:17,50
Blond extends his fist and SOMEONE gives it a friendly bump. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS947
01:33:14,00 --> 01:33:19,50
Smiling at him, Blond moves on. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS948
01:33:17,00 --> 01:33:23,50
A white pickup arrives, its bed loaded with rowdy young surfers. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS949
01:33:20,00 --> 01:33:24,50
Standing with a friend, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS950
01:33:22,00 --> 01:33:26,50
SOMEONE observes them gravely. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS951
01:33:26,00 --> 01:33:30,50
His friend nods. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS952
01:33:27,00 --> 01:33:33,50
The two men return to the side of the van where SOMEONE prepares his wetsuit. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS953
01:33:37,00 --> 01:33:42,50
SOMEONE's buddy pats SOMEONE's shoulder and heads out. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS954
01:33:48,00 --> 01:33:52,50
SOMEONE nods understandingly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS955
01:33:50,00 --> 01:33:58,50
Now, massive waves roll in tiers toward the shore. A breaking wave sends up a giant blast of foam and spray. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS956
01:33:56,00 --> 01:34:02,50
Hiking down with his loved ones, SOMEONE holds SOMEONE's hand. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS957
01:34:03,00 --> 01:34:09,50
A monstrous wave curls into a barrel big enough to hold a bus. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS958
01:34:12,00 --> 01:34:18,50
Now, in his wetsuit, SOMEONE waxes his board on the beach. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS959
01:34:17,00 --> 01:34:22,50
He pauses, staring out at the intimidating surf. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS960
01:34:20,00 --> 01:34:25,50
SOMEONE arrives and kneels down beside him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS961
01:34:29,00 --> 01:34:36,50
SOMEONE takes in the roiling foamy waters crashing the bone yard then faces SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS962
01:34:35,00 --> 01:34:41,50
Taking in his resolute expression, SOMEONE backs off. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS963
01:34:39,00 --> 01:34:45,50
SOMEONE's doubtful friend stands close to the water's edge. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS965
01:34:44,00 --> 01:34:48,50
Glancing at SOMEONE, he pulls up his scalp fitted hood. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS966
01:34:46,00 --> 01:34:51,50
SOMEONE arrives at SOMEONE's side and crouches. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS967
01:34:57,00 --> 01:35:03,50
Nearby, SOMEONE's three buddies paddle out into the water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS968
01:35:01,00 --> 01:35:07,50
Staying by SOMEONE's side, SOMEONE lowers his emotional gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS969
01:35:20,00 --> 01:35:26,50
SOMEONE takes this in, then turns his gaze out toward the water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS971
01:35:25,00 --> 01:35:30,50
His eyes glistening tearfully, SOMEONE pats the youth and stands. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS972
01:35:28,00 --> 01:35:34,50
Reaching into his supply bag, SOMEONE produces a letter. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS973
01:35:31,00 --> 01:35:37,50
He gives it to his mentor then takes up his board and marches off. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS974
01:35:35,00 --> 01:35:39,50
SOMEONE watches emotionally. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS975
01:35:40,00 --> 01:35:46,50
Adjusting his hood, SOMEONE steps into the surf with the board under his arm. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS976
01:35:43,00 --> 01:35:50,50
SOMEONE walks up beside SOMEONE as the watch SOMEONE paddle out, one foot in the air. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS977
01:35:49,00 --> 01:35:53,50
SOMEONE throws his arm around her. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS978
01:35:53,00 --> 01:36:00,50
The grey undulating ocean gathers itself up and rolls beneath SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS979
01:35:59,00 --> 01:36:07,50
Further out, SOMEONE's three surfing buddies disappear over the top of a cresting 15-foot wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS980
01:36:07,00 --> 01:36:14,50
SOMEONE follows, paddling up the wall of water and over the lip just seconds before it breaks. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS981
01:36:12,00 --> 01:36:20,50
The veteran surfers look back, give him a respectful nod, and they paddle on together as a foursome. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS982
01:36:18,00 --> 01:36:25,50
Up ahead, a blue boat and a smaller fishing boat lurch through the sea spray. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS983
01:36:23,00 --> 01:36:29,50
Motorized rafts race past them at full bore. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS984
01:36:26,00 --> 01:36:32,50
SOMEONE steps out of the cabin of the blue boat wearing a wetsuit. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS985
01:36:30,00 --> 01:36:36,50
He and his friends peer over the rail to see SOMEONE paddling by. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS986
01:36:37,00 --> 01:36:43,50
As he pounds on the cabin, a veteran surfer shakes his head. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS989
01:36:49,00 --> 01:36:55,50
High on the bluffs with SOMEONE by his side, SOMEONE raises a pair of binoculars to his eyes. He watches as the blue boat lurches up and over a cresting 15 footer. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS990
01:37:01,00 --> 01:37:07,50
SOMEONE's friends pitch their boards into the water and dive in. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS991
01:37:05,00 --> 01:37:10,50
Another surfer hops out of a raft. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS992
01:37:07,00 --> 01:37:14,50
They all paddle out to join about two dozen surfers sitting on their boards. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS993
01:37:11,00 --> 01:37:19,50
As the water swells, one of the surfers drops down the face of a glossy 25-foot wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS994
01:37:17,00 --> 01:37:23,50
It quickly curls over him and he vanishes in the barrel. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS996
01:37:21,00 --> 01:37:26,50
On the bluffs, SOMEONE shades her eyes as she watches. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS997
01:37:24,00 --> 01:37:28,50
SOMEONE sets his jaw. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS998
01:37:26,00 --> 01:37:30,50
SOMEONE wanders over to his side. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS999
01:37:28,00 --> 01:37:37,50
SOMEONE peers through the binoculars. He watches as another surfer loses his balance halfway down the face of a 20-foot wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1000
01:37:34,00 --> 01:37:40,50
He falls off his board and vanishes in the crushing break. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1001
01:37:37,00 --> 01:37:42,50
SOMEONE watches as he paddles out. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1002
01:37:39,00 --> 01:37:46,50
Now, two surfers drop in, dangerously close to one another. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1003
01:37:43,00 --> 01:37:47,50
One stumbles over sideways, soon both are lost in a white thundering plume of water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1005
01:37:48,00 --> 01:37:53,50
SOMEONE pushes up on the next swell. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1006
01:37:50,00 --> 01:37:56,50
But at the last moment, he sits back on his board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1007
01:37:58,00 --> 01:38:06,50
SOMEONE, with a concerned look, watches the next wave curl over a group of surfers as they paddle up its face. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1008
01:38:03,00 --> 01:38:07,50
It breaks too fast. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1009
01:38:12,00 --> 01:38:18,50
The surfers call to one another as they beat a path to the right. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1010
01:38:18,00 --> 01:38:23,50
Now, the waves break one right after another. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1011
01:38:21,00 --> 01:38:26,50
A nasty 30-foot wave curls over onto itself. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1012
01:38:24,00 --> 01:38:30,50
The blue boat floats dangerously close to the impact zone. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1013
01:38:28,00 --> 01:38:33,50
The captain barks into his radio. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1014
01:38:33,00 --> 01:38:39,50
The raft riders power up over the lip, bouncing back down roughly. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1015
01:38:38,00 --> 01:38:47,50
SOMEONE and the veterans perform turtle rolls, flipping their boards on top of them and punching through safely to the other side. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1016
01:38:49,00 --> 01:38:57,50
As the 30 foot monster starts to break, the group paddles up and over it in the SOMEONE of time. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1017
01:38:54,00 --> 01:39:02,50
Through his binoculars, SOMEONE watches a handful of surfers being rolled up into the wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1018
01:39:00,00 --> 01:39:04,50
SOMEONE draws a sharp breath. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1019
01:39:02,00 --> 01:39:05,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1020
01:39:06,00 --> 01:39:13,50
The blue boat groans up a wave at a 30-degree angle, pitching port side. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1021
01:39:10,00 --> 01:39:17,50
It makes it over, nearly capsizing as it slams down behind the fishing boat. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1022
01:39:15,00 --> 01:39:20,50
A rider bounces out of his raft. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1023
01:39:18,00 --> 01:39:23,50
An unmanned surfboard slaps against the back of a swell. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1024
01:39:21,00 --> 01:39:28,50
The foursome hurls themselves up and over a 25-footer through a fog of sea spray. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1025
01:39:26,00 --> 01:39:32,50
SOMEONE paddles at a steady pace, breathing out through his mouth. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1026
01:39:38,00 --> 01:39:43,50
He eyes a building swell and sits up on his board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1027
01:39:41,00 --> 01:39:47,50
He glances behind him, first to the bluffs, then to the weather station. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1028
01:39:45,00 --> 01:39:50,50
He sizes up the wave one more time 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1029
01:39:47,00 --> 01:39:53,50
then turns around and paddles, preparing to catch this one. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1030
01:39:51,00 --> 01:39:56,50
The veterans look over their shoulders and press ahead. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1031
01:39:53,00 --> 01:39:58,50
SOMEONE shields her eyes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1032
01:39:56,00 --> 01:40:03,50
SOMEONE raises his binoculars to see SOMEONE arrowing down the face of a cresting wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1033
01:40:01,00 --> 01:40:05,50
His mouth hangs open. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1034
01:40:02,00 --> 01:40:10,50
On a fishing boat, a white haired photographer with a battered baseball cap aims his lens. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1035
01:40:08,00 --> 01:40:13,50
SOMEONE shifts her weight, lips parted. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1036
01:40:11,00 --> 01:40:15,50
SOMEONE pops up. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1037
01:40:13,00 --> 01:40:20,50
With the board jutting out perpendicular over the wave, SOMEONE takes a wide stance. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1038
01:40:18,00 --> 01:40:23,50
The camera captures his image. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1039
01:40:20,00 --> 01:40:24,50
The board goes vertical. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1040
01:40:21,00 --> 01:40:28,50
The photographer lowers his camera to see the board tumble backwards behind the wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1041
01:40:27,00 --> 01:40:34,50
SOMEONE clutches SOMEONE's arm as they watch the surf explode like a volcano. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1042
01:40:31,00 --> 01:40:36,50
It sends clouds of foam high into the air. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1043
01:40:34,00 --> 01:40:40,50
With a grave look, one of SOMEONE's buddies sits up. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1044
01:40:37,00 --> 01:40:44,50
The others look back to see receding break fling SOMEONE's tiny surfboard up and swallow it. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1045
01:40:42,00 --> 01:40:47,50
SOMEONE breathes hard, watching in anguish. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1046
01:40:45,00 --> 01:40:51,50
SOMEONE takes a step forward, his eyes locked on the surf. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1047
01:40:50,00 --> 01:40:56,50
Under water, SOMEONE flails his arms against the turbulence. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1048
01:40:56,00 --> 01:41:01,50
His ankle strap yanks him upside down. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1049
01:41:00,00 --> 01:41:07,50
SOMEONE looks through his binoculars and spots his board sticking straight up out of the turmoil. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1050
01:41:09,00 --> 01:41:14,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE in terror. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1051
01:41:11,00 --> 01:41:16,50
SOMEONE twists under water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1052
01:41:14,00 --> 01:41:19,50
Another monster wave thunders down. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1053
01:41:17,00 --> 01:41:22,50
The undertow churns likes a storm cloud. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1054
01:41:20,00 --> 01:41:27,50
As the breaking wave rushes over SOMEONE's board, his ankle strap comes off. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1055
01:41:26,00 --> 01:41:32,50
The board pops up into the air and twirls over the waves untethered. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1056
01:41:30,00 --> 01:41:34,50
SOMEONE gasps. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1057
01:41:33,00 --> 01:41:37,50
SOMEONE lowers his binoculars. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1058
01:41:35,00 --> 01:41:42,50
The veterans watch the white water ram into the treacherous rocks of the bone yard. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1059
01:41:39,00 --> 01:41:44,50
SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE a pleading look. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1060
01:41:42,00 --> 01:41:48,50
On his hand, one finger uncurls around the barrel of the binoculars. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1061
01:41:46,00 --> 01:41:51,50
Slowly, a second finger uncurls. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1062
01:41:49,00 --> 01:41:54,50
The fishing boat makes it way over to the board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1063
01:41:52,00 --> 01:41:57,50
SOMEONE soberly wipes his mouth and chin. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1064
01:41:58,00 --> 01:42:04,50
SOMEONE scans the bone yard but sees no sign of SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1065
01:42:02,00 --> 01:42:07,50
He lowers his binoculars. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1066
01:42:05,00 --> 01:42:10,50
The fishing boat hauls his board on deck. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1067
01:42:09,00 --> 01:42:13,50
SOMEONE uncurls a third finger. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1068
01:42:13,00 --> 01:42:20,50
An aerial of the bone yard reveals nothing but roiling white foam. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1069
01:42:19,00 --> 01:42:24,50
SOMEONE sighs, dropping his head. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1071
01:42:23,00 --> 01:42:27,50
SOMEONE looks from SOMEONE to the surf. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1072
01:42:30,00 --> 01:42:34,50
SOMEONE emerges from the water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1073
01:42:33,00 --> 01:42:41,50
She points to the tiny head and shoulders just before they disappear again in an oncoming surge. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1074
01:42:39,00 --> 01:42:44,50
SOMEONE wears a proud look. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1075
01:42:42,00 --> 01:42:49,50
SOMEONE pops out again, tears off his hood and loosens his collar. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1076
01:42:47,00 --> 01:42:53,50
With her hand concealing a relieved smile, SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1077
01:42:53,00 --> 01:42:57,50
SOMEONE swims over to the fishing boat. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1078
01:42:59,00 --> 01:43:04,50
The photographer reaches down from the stern. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1079
01:43:06,00 --> 01:43:11,50
The photographer smiles, then turns. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1080
01:43:10,00 --> 01:43:16,50
A deck hand brings the board and the photographer hands it down to SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1081
01:43:17,00 --> 01:43:22,50
The photographer nods. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1082
01:43:19,00 --> 01:43:24,50
SOMEONE lies down on his board and paddles away. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1083
01:43:22,00 --> 01:43:26,50
SOMEONE squints from the bluffs. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1084
01:43:25,00 --> 01:43:30,50
SOMEONE makes his way over another swell. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1085
01:43:28,00 --> 01:43:32,50
SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1086
01:43:29,00 --> 01:43:34,50
A grin pulls at the corner of his mouth. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1087
01:43:36,00 --> 01:43:42,50
SOMEONE paddles by the blue boat as it takes in a broken board. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1088
01:43:44,00 --> 01:43:50,50
Exhausted surfers haul themselves into rafts. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1089
01:43:50,00 --> 01:43:55,50
Another casualty pads along the shore, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1090
01:43:53,00 --> 01:43:58,50
the two halves of his board under his arm. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1091
01:43:55,00 --> 01:44:00,50
Only a handful of surfers remain in the water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1092
01:44:02,00 --> 01:44:08,50
Sitting on his board, SOMEONE turns as SOMEONE sits up next to him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1093
01:44:05,00 --> 01:44:10,50
They watch another crusher. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1094
01:44:19,00 --> 01:44:23,50
SOMEONE stifles a smirk. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1095
01:44:21,00 --> 01:44:27,50
He leans down and paddles off as SOMEONE watches with a little smile. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1096
01:44:27,00 --> 01:44:33,50
On the bluffs, SOMEONE squints down at the envelope in his hand. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1097
01:44:31,00 --> 01:44:35,50
As SOMEONE paddles out over the swells, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1098
01:44:33,00 --> 01:44:37,50
he reads the typewritten letter. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1099
01:45:00,00 --> 01:45:06,50
He looks up to see SOMEONE rejoin his surfing buddies. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1100
01:45:17,00 --> 01:45:22,50
He sits on his board, adjusting his hood. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1102
01:45:21,00 --> 01:45:26,50
The foursome look patiently out to sea where another swell begins to build. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1104
01:45:53,00 --> 01:45:58,50
In slow motion, he surfs down a 30-foot wave. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1105
01:46:05,00 --> 01:46:11,50
As he reaches the bottom, it breaks right behind him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1106
01:46:08,00 --> 01:46:12,50
SOMEONE's face drops. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1107
01:46:10,00 --> 01:46:16,50
The avalanche of white water catches up behind him fast. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1108
01:46:13,00 --> 01:46:20,50
As he struggles to keep his balance, it overtakes him and he disappears again. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1109
01:46:20,00 --> 01:46:24,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE take deep breaths. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1110
01:46:23,00 --> 01:46:28,50
The surfers aboard the blue boat stand watch. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1111
01:46:27,00 --> 01:46:31,50
The photographer frowns. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1112
01:46:29,00 --> 01:46:34,50
A veteran surfer's mouth hangs open. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1113
01:46:40,00 --> 01:46:46,50
Suddenly, SOMEONE emerges, still surfing, from the cloud of spray. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1114
01:46:44,00 --> 01:46:49,50
Up on the bluff, onlookers cheer and clap. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1115
01:46:47,00 --> 01:46:53,50
SOMEONE breaks into a smile and throws his arm around the beaming SOMEONE. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1116
01:46:54,00 --> 01:47:01,50
SOMEONE swerves right and shoots through the hollow, letting the wave curl over him. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1117
01:47:07,00 --> 01:47:13,50
SOMEONE stands on the deck of the boat, griping the rail and watching. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1118
01:47:11,00 --> 01:47:19,50
SOMEONE comes out of the barrel near the bone yard and speeds toward shore, the froth nipping at his heels. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1119
01:47:23,00 --> 01:47:28,50
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE the letter and leaves. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1120
01:47:27,00 --> 01:47:34,50
As SOMEONE slows down, he turns to see the veterans sitting on their boards smiling. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1121
01:47:33,00 --> 01:47:38,50
One lifts his hands and claps. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1123
01:47:36,00 --> 01:47:40,50
With a grin, SOMEONE heads into shore. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1124
01:47:39,00 --> 01:47:43,50
SOMEONE clutches her throat. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1125
01:47:41,00 --> 01:47:48,50
SOMEONE walks into the surf to meet SOMEONE and they throw their arms around each other. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1126
01:47:48,00 --> 01:47:54,50
Now, a magazine cover features the photo of his wipe out at Mavericks. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1127
01:48:13,00 --> 01:48:18,50
A photo shows SOMEONE and SOMEONE together. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1129
01:48:16,00 --> 01:48:22,50
Now, a man free dives in turquoise sun-streaked water 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1130
01:48:20,00 --> 01:48:24,50
wearing only fins and board shorts. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1131
01:48:22,00 --> 01:48:27,50
He turns around and looks up at the surface. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1133
01:48:25,00 --> 01:48:30,50
Bubbles float from his nostrils 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1134
01:48:27,00 --> 01:48:32,50
and three fingers curl into his palm. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1135
01:48:43,00 --> 01:48:49,50
SOMEONE curls another finger into his palm, leaving only his thumb up. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1136
01:48:47,00 --> 01:48:52,50
Now, SOMEONE stands on the beach, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1137
01:48:49,00 --> 01:48:54,50
a knit black cap on his head. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1138
01:48:51,00 --> 01:48:57,50
He stares at the surf with his hands in his pockets. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1139
01:48:56,00 --> 01:49:00,50
He lifts his hand to the back of his neck 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1140
01:48:58,00 --> 01:49:01,50
and gives it a squeeze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1141
01:49:00,00 --> 01:49:06,50
He turns to see SOMEONE looking up at him with pain in her eyes. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1142
01:49:03,00 --> 01:49:07,50
Her lips part. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1143
01:49:05,00 --> 01:49:09,50
He blinks pensively. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1146
01:49:13,00 --> 01:49:18,50
Words appear. Seven years after his historic ride, SOMEONE drowned while free diving in the Maldives. He was 22 years old. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1149
01:49:20,00 --> 01:49:27,50
Now, SOMEONE sits on a surfboard, a white lei around his neck. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1150
01:49:24,00 --> 01:49:30,50
He scoops his hands through the water and throws it in the air. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1151
01:49:29,00 --> 01:49:33,50
Beside him, SOMEONE watches with a pained expression. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1153
01:49:32,00 --> 01:49:37,50
SOMEONE looks on with a mournful gaze. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1154
01:49:34,00 --> 01:49:40,50
Dozens of surfers around them toss up water. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1155
01:49:39,00 --> 01:49:43,50
SOMEONE joins in. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1156
01:49:44,00 --> 01:49:50,50
Everyone, floating on surfboards and wearing leis, 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1157
01:49:47,00 --> 01:49:52,50
splashes water into the air. 

CHASING_MAVERICKS_DVS1158
01:49:49,00 --> 01:49:55,50
An aerial view shows their multi-colored surfboards in a circle.
