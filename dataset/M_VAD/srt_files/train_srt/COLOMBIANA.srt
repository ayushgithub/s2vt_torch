COLOMBIANA_DVS48
00:02:45,00 --> 00:02:54,50
Our view crests an overcrowded hillside slum with narrow stairways leading upwards between the dilapidated buildings. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS50
00:02:53,00 --> 00:02:56,50
To black. Words appear. Colombia, 1992. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS53
00:03:00,00 --> 00:03:06,50
Armed guards patrol the courtyard of a tropical mansion. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS54
00:03:03,00 --> 00:03:12,50
On a covered patio, a man with thick dark hair and a beard sits across a small table from a younger stubble faced man. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS55
00:03:21,00 --> 00:03:27,50
SOMEONE clutches SOMEONE's hand between his. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS56
00:03:28,00 --> 00:03:33,50
He places his free hand on his mentor. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS57
00:03:39,00 --> 00:03:43,50
He hands SOMEONE a glass. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS58
00:03:42,00 --> 00:03:46,50
The younger man lifts his drink. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS59
00:03:47,00 --> 00:03:51,50
They tap glasses. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS60
00:03:48,00 --> 00:03:54,50
With their weary eyes fixed on each other, they both take a sip. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS61
00:03:57,00 --> 00:04:01,50
He reaches into his pocket. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS62
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:06,50
He hands over a small stack of floppy disks. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS63
00:04:09,00 --> 00:04:15,50
SOMEONE rises and spreads his arms. SOMEONE embraces him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS64
00:04:17,00 --> 00:04:21,50
He returns to his seat. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS65
00:04:22,00 --> 00:04:28,50
A bearded man with shoulder length hair pats SOMEONE on the back. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS66
00:04:26,00 --> 00:04:31,50
SOMEONE sips his drink as he watches his friend leave. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS67
00:04:32,00 --> 00:04:38,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE hurries to a car guarded by armed men. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS68
00:04:35,00 --> 00:04:42,50
One opens a door for him. Inside, he bangs his hand on the dashboard. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS69
00:04:59,00 --> 00:05:03,50
The car speeds off. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS70
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:06,50
Two of SOMEONE's men sit in the back seat with rifles ready. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS71
00:05:04,00 --> 00:05:13,50
Bobbing down a narrow street with a ridged surface, the vehicle halts beside a multi-story home at the top of a hill. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS72
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:15,50
SOMEONE and his guards get out. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS73
00:05:12,00 --> 00:05:17,50
The stubble faced man looks out on the city, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS74
00:05:15,00 --> 00:05:21,50
his thoughtful gaze sweeping over the clustered buildings before him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS75
00:05:18,00 --> 00:05:23,50
Turning away, he heads toward the home. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS76
00:05:21,00 --> 00:05:26,50
The armed bodyguards follow him closely. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS78
00:05:29,00 --> 00:05:35,50
a woman serves milk to a young girl sucking a lollipop. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS79
00:05:38,00 --> 00:05:43,50
SOMEONE's mother leaves her at the kitchen table. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS80
00:05:41,00 --> 00:05:50,50
SOMEONE turns over a framed family photo, removes a computer chip from under a piece of tape, then opens a drawer and rifles through it. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS81
00:05:48,00 --> 00:05:52,50
He pulls out a business card. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS82
00:05:51,00 --> 00:05:55,50
He kneels in front of her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS83
00:05:58,00 --> 00:06:01,50
He shows the chip. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS84
00:06:07,00 --> 00:06:11,50
He tucks it into her pocket. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS85
00:06:23,00 --> 00:06:30,50
He scribbles a Chicago address on a piece of paper, folds it, and tucks it into her jumper. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS86
00:06:31,00 --> 00:06:36,50
He takes off a necklace with a flower pendant. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS87
00:06:43,00 --> 00:06:47,50
He puts it on his daughter. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS88
00:06:51,00 --> 00:06:57,50
Releasing her hand, he draws her in and kisses her brow. They hug. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS89
00:06:57,00 --> 00:07:04,50
He closes his eyes as he clutches his daughter, then opens them with a fearful look. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS90
00:07:01,00 --> 00:07:07,50
Outside, a beat up sedan stops in front of the building. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS91
00:07:07,00 --> 00:07:11,50
One of SOMEONE's men peers in. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS92
00:07:12,00 --> 00:07:16,50
SOMEONE watches from a window. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS93
00:07:20,00 --> 00:07:26,50
Toting a suitcase, his wife ushers SOMEONE into the next room. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS94
00:07:24,00 --> 00:07:32,50
Moving past them, SOMEONE opens a back door. He stops as he sees another car approaching. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS95
00:07:29,00 --> 00:07:39,50
The family hurries back into the kitchen. SOMEONE looks out a window at the sedan below. The beefy man in the passenger seat uses a radio. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS97
00:07:44,00 --> 00:07:52,50
as his wife rushes into the next room, SOMEONE takes his daughter's hands and drops to one knee. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS98
00:07:59,00 --> 00:08:04,50
He kisses her hands then pats her cheek. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS99
00:08:08,00 --> 00:08:13,50
The beefy thug shoots at the bodyguards. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS100
00:08:10,00 --> 00:08:16,50
Their bodies convulse as bullets tear into them. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS101
00:08:13,00 --> 00:08:21,50
Inside, SOMEONE removes a hand gun from a magnetic strip on the underside of the kitchen table. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS102
00:08:18,00 --> 00:08:24,50
A knife rests on another strip beside it. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS103
00:08:21,00 --> 00:08:28,50
As he guides his daughter to sit back down at the table, his wife returns with two more guns. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS104
00:08:28,00 --> 00:08:35,50
She kneels in front of her daughter. Outside, SOMEONE's men exit the sedan. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS105
00:08:35,00 --> 00:08:42,50
SOMEONE pulls his wife away, leaving SOMEONE alone at the table. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS106
00:08:41,00 --> 00:08:46,50
The gunmen charge into the building. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS107
00:08:43,00 --> 00:08:49,50
SOMEONE leads Alicia to the staircase, firing a shotgun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS108
00:08:48,00 --> 00:08:58,50
SOMEONE sees her mother racing back up the stairs. Just as Alicia reaches the doorway, two bullets tear through her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS109
00:08:55,00 --> 00:09:00,50
Her eyes squeeze shut in agony. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS110
00:08:58,00 --> 00:09:02,50
More shots riddle her body. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS111
00:09:04,00 --> 00:09:10,50
With her anguished gaze fixed on her daughter, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS112
00:09:07,00 --> 00:09:11,50
she slumps to the floor. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS113
00:09:09,00 --> 00:09:20,50
SOMEONE watches with a creased brow, a hint of tears glistening in her wide eyes. SOMEONE retreats up the stairs, still firing his shotgun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS114
00:09:17,00 --> 00:09:25,50
Bullets hit his chest sending bursts of blood from his back as they tear through him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS115
00:09:22,00 --> 00:09:28,50
SOMEONE flinches slightly at the gun shots. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS116
00:09:25,00 --> 00:09:32,50
Tears continue to well up in her eyes as she watches her father in the doorway. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS117
00:09:30,00 --> 00:09:36,50
He turns away from the stairs and drops to his knees. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS118
00:09:33,00 --> 00:09:38,50
Raising his helpless gaze to his daughter, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS119
00:09:36,00 --> 00:09:44,50
he lifts a trembling hand toward his face, then drops to the floor beside his dying wife. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS120
00:09:42,00 --> 00:09:49,50
As Alicia falls still, SOMEONE rolls onto his back and shuts his eyes. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS121
00:09:46,00 --> 00:09:54,50
From the kitchen table, SOMEONE stares at her dead parents, her body trembling slightly. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS122
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:06,50
Through the open door, she sees the beefy thug ascend the staircase. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS123
00:10:04,00 --> 00:10:09,50
He steps into the kitchen with his gun raised. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS124
00:10:06,00 --> 00:10:12,50
Another thug enters with SOMEONE behind him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS125
00:10:09,00 --> 00:10:19,50
As the gunmen search the place tearing up couch cushions, the bearded gangster removes his sunglasses and crouches over his dead enemy. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS126
00:10:30,00 --> 00:10:38,50
He shifts his gaze to SOMEONE who continues to stare straight ahead with a stoic expression. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS127
00:10:35,00 --> 00:10:43,50
As SOMEONE inspects the framed family photo, the beefy thug points his gun at the girl's head. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS128
00:10:53,00 --> 00:11:01,50
SOMEONE sits across from SOMEONE and folds his arms on the table, then eyes the beefy gunman. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS129
00:11:02,00 --> 00:11:09,50
Under the bearded gangster's haughty gaze, the thug lowers his gun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS130
00:11:09,00 --> 00:11:12,50
He strides off. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS131
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:17,50
She shakes her head. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS132
00:11:21,00 --> 00:11:25,50
He spots her necklace. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS134
00:11:54,00 --> 00:11:58,50
She nods. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS135
00:12:05,00 --> 00:12:09,50
He pinches his fingers. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS136
00:12:08,00 --> 00:12:13,50
SOMEONE glances down then nods. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS137
00:12:24,00 --> 00:12:29,50
SOMEONE extends his hand. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS138
00:12:44,00 --> 00:12:50,50
SOMEONE grabs the hidden knife and stabs his hand to the table. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS139
00:12:49,00 --> 00:12:56,50
Racing into a bathroom, she slides open a window, pulls herself out and drops onto a ledge. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS140
00:12:54,00 --> 00:12:59,50
SOMEONE yanks the knife out of his hand. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS141
00:12:58,00 --> 00:13:06,50
Lowering herself to another ledge, she uses the top one for cover as a bald gunman shoots down at her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS142
00:13:03,00 --> 00:13:09,50
She swallows the computer chip. SOMEONE grabs the gunman. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS143
00:13:08,00 --> 00:13:15,50
As SOMEONE swings down to a corner ledge, a brawny gunman climbs out a window after her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS144
00:13:13,00 --> 00:13:18,50
She drops onto the roof of a parked car. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS145
00:13:15,00 --> 00:13:22,50
The gunman follows her as she races across the street and enters a building. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS146
00:13:19,00 --> 00:13:25,50
A guy on a Honda motorcycle halts in front of SOMEONE's home. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS147
00:13:25,00 --> 00:13:30,50
The motorcyclist takes off down the hill. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS148
00:13:28,00 --> 00:13:34,50
SOMEONE sprints through an apartment then exits onto a balcony. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS149
00:13:31,00 --> 00:13:39,50
As she acrobatically makes her way down to a terrace, the brawny gunman spots her from the rooftop. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS150
00:13:36,00 --> 00:13:41,50
He leaps down after her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS151
00:13:38,00 --> 00:13:42,50
Two others join him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS152
00:13:39,00 --> 00:13:45,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE and some men take off in an SUV 

COLOMBIANA_DVS153
00:13:43,00 --> 00:13:48,50
while another group gives chase in the sedan. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS154
00:13:45,00 --> 00:13:55,50
Scrambling over a low wall, SOMEONE smashes through a wood plank roof and lands on a table. She races past an elderly man in a garden. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS155
00:13:55,00 --> 00:14:01,50
Behind her, a gunman smashes through a different part of the roof. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS156
00:13:58,00 --> 00:14:05,50
In a courtyard, SOMEONE weaves around sheets hanging on clotheslines 

COLOMBIANA_DVS157
00:14:02,00 --> 00:14:08,50
then passes a row of women doing laundry in plastic tubs. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS158
00:14:05,00 --> 00:14:12,50
As SOMEONE's men burst in after her, she races down a balcony. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS159
00:14:10,00 --> 00:14:16,50
She climbs through an open window into a man's apartment. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS160
00:14:17,00 --> 00:14:20,50
She runs off. Following her, a gunman rushes past the angry resident. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS161
00:14:21,00 --> 00:14:27,50
Outside, SOMEONE glances over her shoulder. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS162
00:14:24,00 --> 00:14:30,50
SOMEONE hurries down a flight of stairs into an alley. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS163
00:14:27,00 --> 00:14:32,50
The gunman follows. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS164
00:14:30,00 --> 00:14:41,50
As SOMEONE emerges on a sidewalk, she spots the motorcyclist approaching and takes off down a stone staircase. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS165
00:14:38,00 --> 00:14:44,50
The biker gives chase with two gunmen running behind him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS166
00:14:44,00 --> 00:14:56,50
Turning a corner into a covered marketplace, SOMEONE sprints past an arcade and various vendors. She leaps over a man crouching on the ground and he glances after her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS167
00:14:53,00 --> 00:14:58,50
The motorcyclist closes in. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS168
00:14:55,00 --> 00:15:04,50
SOMEONE turns a sharp corner around a display of bowls holding chili peppers. The biker crashes into it. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS169
00:15:02,00 --> 00:15:07,50
The colorful chili peppers fly into the air. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS170
00:15:04,00 --> 00:15:09,50
Now our view soars over the city. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS171
00:15:07,00 --> 00:15:14,50
SOMEONE runs down a long staircase between the crowded tiers of rundown homes. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS172
00:15:11,00 --> 00:15:18,50
As some of his gunmen give chase, SOMEONE talks into his radio. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS173
00:15:16,00 --> 00:15:23,50
SOMEONE dashes down the stairs with the three gunmen close behind. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS174
00:15:20,00 --> 00:15:31,50
Rounding a corner, she navigates a labyrinth of alleyways. As she nears the end of one alley, her gaze falls on a metal fire escape ladder against the side of an apartment building. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS175
00:15:29,00 --> 00:15:35,50
Stepping onto a stack of wooden crates, she grabs the first rung. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS176
00:15:32,00 --> 00:15:38,50
She climbs up as the beefy thug arrives in the alley. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS177
00:15:35,00 --> 00:15:41,50
He spots her feet disappearing over the rooftop's edge. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS178
00:15:38,00 --> 00:15:45,50
Meanwhile, the acrobatic brawny gunman leaps from a stack of crates onto another roof. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS179
00:15:42,00 --> 00:15:47,50
He and two others search the vacant area. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS180
00:15:45,00 --> 00:15:53,50
Returning to the ground, he looks down a staircase and sees the beefy thug peering around the corner of a building. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS181
00:15:50,00 --> 00:15:56,50
The thug gestures and his acrobatic cohort climbs back onto the roof. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS182
00:15:54,00 --> 00:16:05,50
The gunmen leap from building to building, searching the surrounding area. The acrobatic man peers down into an alley where the beefy thug barks an order into his radio. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS183
00:16:05,00 --> 00:16:09,50
The gunmen return to the alley. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS185
00:16:11,00 --> 00:16:19,50
A view down a chimney shows SOMEONE huddled at the bottom, rocking slightly with her hand clapped over her mouth. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS186
00:16:17,00 --> 00:16:22,50
Now she emerges from an alley onto a quiet road. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS187
00:16:25,00 --> 00:16:33,50
As she casually strolls along, the sedan full of gunmen turns a corner and rolls up behind her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS188
00:16:30,00 --> 00:16:35,50
Noticing it, she breaks into a run. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS189
00:16:32,00 --> 00:16:39,50
The SUV with SOMEONE inside approaches from the opposite end of the road. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS190
00:16:36,00 --> 00:16:41,50
He aims a gun out his window. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS191
00:16:40,00 --> 00:16:44,50
They cut her off. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS192
00:16:42,00 --> 00:16:48,50
Finding herself boxed in, she slides down a storm drain opening and disappears. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS193
00:16:46,00 --> 00:16:50,50
The thugs peer after her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS194
00:16:48,00 --> 00:16:54,50
SOMEONE shoots his handgun into the storm drain opening. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS195
00:16:51,00 --> 00:16:56,50
The others follow suit with their automatics. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS196
00:16:53,00 --> 00:17:03,50
Dust billows into the air from their flying bullets. The motorcyclist and the three guys on foot join the group and peer at the storm drain. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS197
00:17:01,00 --> 00:17:07,50
Meanwhile, a manhole cover rises from the middle of a street. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS198
00:17:04,00 --> 00:17:11,50
Sliding it aside, SOMEONE lifts her face to the bright sunlight and squints. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS199
00:17:10,00 --> 00:17:17,50
She rubs her eyes then glances around and climbs out of the hole. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS200
00:17:14,00 --> 00:17:23,50
Cars and pedestrians take little notice as they bustle past the dirty faced girl in her sullied school uniform. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS201
00:17:21,00 --> 00:17:28,50
Later, she reaches a building surrounded by a tall wrought iron fence. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS202
00:17:25,00 --> 00:17:30,50
Armed soldiers stand posted at its gate. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS203
00:17:29,00 --> 00:17:34,50
Consulting the business card from her father, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS204
00:17:31,00 --> 00:17:37,50
the dazed girl walks toward one of the security guards. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS205
00:17:41,00 --> 00:17:46,50
She offers the card. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS207
00:17:49,00 --> 00:17:55,50
Now inside, a man reads a name on it - John C. Davies, Embassy of the United States of America. He gazes at SOMEONE who sits in front of his desk. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS208
00:17:57,00 --> 00:18:03,50
As SOMEONE averts her gaze, the American leans closer. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS209
00:18:01,00 --> 00:18:08,50
She lifts her eyes to his then glances at an older man at a desk nearby. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS210
00:18:06,00 --> 00:18:12,50
Taking a deep breath, she sticks a finger down her throat. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS211
00:18:12,00 --> 00:18:17,50
He recoils as she barfs on his desk. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS212
00:18:14,00 --> 00:18:22,50
Wiping her mouth, she settles back into her seat and uses one finger to poke around the vomit. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS213
00:18:21,00 --> 00:18:26,50
She finds the computer chip and holds it out. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS214
00:18:26,00 --> 00:18:30,50
He grabs a tissue. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS215
00:18:27,00 --> 00:18:32,50
Grimacing, he uses it to take the chip. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS216
00:18:30,00 --> 00:18:39,50
His older colleague watches in disbelief as he cleans it off and places it in a disk which he then inserts into his computer. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS217
00:18:37,00 --> 00:18:43,50
He types a command and information scrolls up the screen. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS218
00:18:40,00 --> 00:18:47,50
His mouth hanging agape, he shifts his astonished gaze to SOMEONE. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS219
00:18:48,00 --> 00:18:52,50
Two subordinates leave. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS220
00:18:52,00 --> 00:18:58,50
His older colleague hits a button on his desk which activates a camera. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS221
00:19:03,00 --> 00:19:07,50
He glances at his computer. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS222
00:19:09,00 --> 00:19:13,50
She eyes him steadily. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS223
00:19:11,00 --> 00:19:16,50
Now we flight toward Acosta City's jutting skyscraper. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS224
00:19:14,00 --> 00:19:19,50
On a government jet, a woman sits with SOMEONE. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS225
00:19:23,00 --> 00:19:29,50
On the ground, the jet slows as it taxis on a tarmac. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS226
00:19:26,00 --> 00:19:32,50
Later, SOMEONE and her escort stride down a jet way. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS228
00:19:32,00 --> 00:19:35,50
Now a man's hand stamps a passport. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS229
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:37,50
SOMEONE and her escort sit in front of his desk. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS230
00:19:34,00 --> 00:19:41,50
The bureaucrat sets a short stack of cash in front of the girl. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS231
00:19:40,00 --> 00:19:45,50
With a frown, she grabs the passport and money. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS232
00:19:43,00 --> 00:19:49,50
Now a security guard leads her and her escort down a corridor. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS233
00:19:46,00 --> 00:19:52,50
As they pass a restroom, SOMEONE tugs on the woman's wrist. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS234
00:19:51,00 --> 00:19:57,50
Entering the bathroom, SOMEONE strides to the last stall 

COLOMBIANA_DVS235
00:19:54,00 --> 00:20:00,50
which sits beside a row of windows at her eye level. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS236
00:19:57,00 --> 00:20:02,50
She steps inside and pulls the door shut. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS237
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:07,50
In the corridor, her escort checks her watch then peers inside the restroom. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS238
00:20:04,00 --> 00:20:10,50
Finding the door to the last stall closed, she walks over. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS239
00:20:13,00 --> 00:20:17,50
She opens it and finds it empty. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS240
00:20:15,00 --> 00:20:19,50
A window lies ajar. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS241
00:20:16,00 --> 00:20:22,50
The woman hurries off past the security guard. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS242
00:20:19,00 --> 00:20:25,50
Now SOMEONE stands at a ticket kiosk in a bus station. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS243
00:20:25,00 --> 00:20:30,50
She hands him the address written out by her father. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS244
00:20:34,00 --> 00:20:38,50
She holds up her wad of cash. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS245
00:20:36,00 --> 00:20:45,50
Now hazy sunlight glimmers off the mirrored panels of Chicago's skyscrapers as we move over the downtown area. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS246
00:20:42,00 --> 00:20:49,50
A Trailways bus crosses a bridge and a bird's eye view follows it up a street. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS247
00:20:47,00 --> 00:20:54,50
Inside, SOMEONE rests her arm against a window and stares out at the passing city. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS248
00:20:52,00 --> 00:21:00,50
Later, she enters Union Station's great hall and sweeps her gaze around the high ceilinged atrium. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS249
00:20:58,00 --> 00:21:06,50
She timidly strides between two columns of benches shooting furtive glances at the other commuter. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS251
00:21:09,00 --> 00:21:16,50
SOMEONE reads a comic book as she waits on a platform for an approaching L train. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS252
00:21:13,00 --> 00:21:17,50
Its doors open. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS253
00:21:15,00 --> 00:21:20,50
SOMEONE climbs on and takes a seat. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS254
00:21:17,00 --> 00:21:25,50
She peers out her window then lowers her gaze to her Zena Warrior Princess comic. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS255
00:21:22,00 --> 00:21:27,50
Later, SOMEONE walks a dimly lit alleyway 

COLOMBIANA_DVS256
00:21:25,00 --> 00:21:30,50
where shady looking men talk along its edges. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS257
00:21:32,00 --> 00:21:37,50
She hands the man her scrap of paper with the address. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS258
00:21:34,00 --> 00:21:40,50
He reads it then meets her gaze. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS259
00:21:38,00 --> 00:21:44,50
Now he slams his hand against a shabby building's door. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS260
00:21:42,00 --> 00:21:47,50
It opens and he steps inside. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS261
00:21:44,00 --> 00:21:50,50
SOMEONE sits waiting at a low window sill. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS262
00:21:47,00 --> 00:21:55,50
The man steps into a dingy room where a tall dark haired figure punches a guy sitting in a chair. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS263
00:21:57,00 --> 00:22:02,50
SOMEONE pats his victim's bald head. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS264
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:05,50
Another punch sends thick streams of his blood flying. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS265
00:22:07,00 --> 00:22:12,50
SOMEONE wipes sweat from his face. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS266
00:22:14,00 --> 00:22:19,50
SOMEONE winds up for another blow. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS267
00:22:17,00 --> 00:22:23,50
His fist stops mid punch and his brow furrows. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS268
00:22:20,00 --> 00:22:25,50
He shoots his lackey a stunned look. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS269
00:22:26,00 --> 00:22:35,50
Now SOMEONE's associate leads SOMEONE into a small waiting area within a network of offices. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS270
00:22:32,00 --> 00:22:39,50
As two women leave one of them, she watches them go with a solemn curious gaze. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS271
00:22:37,00 --> 00:22:43,50
A tall shadowy figure arrives on the other side of her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS272
00:22:40,00 --> 00:22:46,50
Turning, she finds SOMEONE staring at her through a set of windows. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS273
00:22:48,00 --> 00:22:54,50
As he strides around a corner, she watches him through the windows. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS274
00:22:52,00 --> 00:22:57,50
SOMEONE arrives before her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS275
00:22:55,00 --> 00:23:02,50
As he drops to his knees and embraces her, she allows herself to cry. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS276
00:23:02,00 --> 00:23:08,50
Large tears stream down the little girl's cheeks. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS277
00:23:08,00 --> 00:23:16,50
Holding her close, SOMEONE cradles her head in his hand as she sobs into his shoulder. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS278
00:23:13,00 --> 00:23:18,50
He eases her back to look her in the eye. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS279
00:23:23,00 --> 00:23:29,50
Cupping her face in his hands, he wipes away her tears with his thumb. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS280
00:23:29,00 --> 00:23:35,50
He kisses her forehead three times then hugs her again. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS281
00:23:38,00 --> 00:23:44,50
Now a sunbeam shines on SOMEONE's face as she sleeps. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS282
00:23:41,00 --> 00:23:47,50
Waking, she takes in her surroundings. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS283
00:23:44,00 --> 00:23:50,50
As she sits up, we notice guns hanging on the wall behind her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS284
00:23:48,00 --> 00:23:54,50
She gets out of bed, crosses to a window, and peers outside. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS285
00:23:52,00 --> 00:23:57,50
A rising sun crests the Chicago skyline. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS286
00:23:55,00 --> 00:24:01,50
An elevated train travels along a track below. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS287
00:23:58,00 --> 00:24:05,50
Now SOMEONE shuffles to a stairway where family photos decorate the wall. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS288
00:24:03,00 --> 00:24:08,50
She touches one of her mother as she passes. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS289
00:24:06,00 --> 00:24:13,50
Later, she arrives at a kitchen and pauses, her fingers lightly drumming her thigh. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS290
00:24:11,00 --> 00:24:18,50
As SOMEONE drinks coffee at a table, an older woman spots SOMEONE. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS291
00:24:16,00 --> 00:24:22,50
She crosses to the girl and kneels before her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS292
00:24:25,00 --> 00:24:30,50
She caresses SOMEONE's face. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS293
00:24:31,00 --> 00:24:37,50
Mama leads her to the kitchen table then returns to the stove. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS294
00:24:35,00 --> 00:24:41,50
Holding a newspaper, SOMEONE gives the girl a sidelong look. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS295
00:24:57,00 --> 00:25:03,50
As he flips pages in his newspaper, Mama serves SOMEONE food. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS296
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:09,50
Mama pauses and faces the table gravely. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS297
00:25:13,00 --> 00:25:19,50
SOMEONE shifts his gaze and turns over his paper. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS298
00:25:32,00 --> 00:25:37,50
He turns over SOMEONE's slip of paper. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS299
00:25:34,00 --> 00:25:39,50
It bears a drawing of Zena on the back. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS300
00:25:48,00 --> 00:25:53,50
Eating her breakfast, the little girl shakes her head. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS301
00:25:53,00 --> 00:25:58,50
She looks up at her uncle with a resolute gaze. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS302
00:25:57,00 --> 00:26:04,50
SOMEONE leans back in his chair and takes a deep breath through parted lips. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS303
00:26:03,00 --> 00:26:08,50
He stares at her then affects a casual gaze. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS304
00:26:07,00 --> 00:26:12,50
His brow furrowed, he plants his hands on the table 

COLOMBIANA_DVS305
00:26:10,00 --> 00:26:15,50
and shares a brief uneasy look with his mother. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS306
00:26:13,00 --> 00:26:19,50
Now SOMEONE leads SOMEONE up the steps to a school's entrance. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS307
00:26:17,00 --> 00:26:25,50
Later in a principal's office, an elegant woman with blonde curls opens a stuffed yellow envelope. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS308
00:26:22,00 --> 00:26:27,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit facing her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS309
00:26:35,00 --> 00:26:40,50
She presents a folded paper to the girl. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS310
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:51,50
The principal stands. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS311
00:26:50,00 --> 00:26:55,50
She smiles down at the girl who coldly gets to her feet. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS312
00:26:53,00 --> 00:27:02,50
As SOMEONE leads her out, the principal sinks back down in her chair and lets out a nervous sigh. Outside. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS313
00:27:07,00 --> 00:27:12,50
Turning, he finds SOMEONE standing motionless. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS314
00:27:25,00 --> 00:27:29,50
He nods and glances around. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS315
00:27:27,00 --> 00:27:35,50
He thrusts SOMEONE's backpack at her, draws a huge handgun and opens fire on a passing car. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS316
00:27:33,00 --> 00:27:39,50
It swerves off the road and hits a fire hydrant, knocking it from it base. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS317
00:27:37,00 --> 00:27:43,50
As fearful bystanders scatter, SOMEONE angrily faces his niece. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS318
00:27:49,00 --> 00:27:56,50
He swipes off his fedora and glances coolly at his handiwork. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS319
00:27:57,00 --> 00:28:01,50
He crouches before the girl. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS320
00:28:11,00 --> 00:28:15,50
He snatches her backpack. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS321
00:28:16,00 --> 00:28:21,50
He holds out the gun and the backpack. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS322
00:28:23,00 --> 00:28:29,50
SOMEONE snatches the backpack from his grasp and slings it over her shoulder. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS323
00:28:27,00 --> 00:28:31,50
SOMEONE holsters his gun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS324
00:28:31,00 --> 00:28:37,50
A police cruiser pulls up by the wrecked car. He straightens, takes out his fedora and beats it back into shape. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS325
00:28:37,00 --> 00:28:43,50
As he puts it back on.  

COLOMBIANA_DVS326
00:28:41,00 --> 00:28:47,50
SOMEONE turns his niece away by the shoulder. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS327
00:28:44,00 --> 00:28:50,50
Keeping his arm around her, he saunters off casually down the sidewalk. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS328
00:28:48,00 --> 00:28:54,50
Now as we peer across a sprawling suburb, words appear. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS329
00:28:51,00 --> 00:28:56,50
California, 15 years later. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS330
00:28:57,00 --> 00:29:02,50
In a parking lot, a cop brings lunch to his partner. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS331
00:29:23,00 --> 00:29:30,50
A red muscle car plows into their cruiser. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS332
00:29:29,00 --> 00:29:35,50
Its door opens and an empty vodka bottle tumbles to the pavement. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS333
00:29:32,00 --> 00:29:38,50
A slender woman in a slinky mini dress staggers out. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS334
00:29:37,00 --> 00:29:41,50
The cops accost her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS335
00:29:46,00 --> 00:29:51,50
They bend her over her car's hood and cuff her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS336
00:29:57,00 --> 00:30:02,50
She wears the orchid pendant. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS337
00:30:05,00 --> 00:30:11,50
Now the cops drag SOMEONE through a police station booking room. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS338
00:30:09,00 --> 00:30:14,50
She stumbles and one of her shoes slips off. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS339
00:30:11,00 --> 00:30:17,50
A portly desk sergeant looks up at her approach. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS340
00:30:16,00 --> 00:30:21,50
The cops sit her down in front of him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS341
00:30:18,00 --> 00:30:24,50
She slumps over, her long black bangs covering her face. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS342
00:30:21,00 --> 00:30:28,50
One of the cops retrieves her shoe and hands it to the sergeant then nudges her up. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS343
00:30:29,00 --> 00:30:34,50
The sergeant looks through her purse. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS344
00:30:52,00 --> 00:30:56,50
She rests her head on the desk. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS345
00:30:58,00 --> 00:31:04,50
She tries to take some candy but he snatches it away. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS346
00:31:12,00 --> 00:31:17,50
She dry heaves. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS347
00:31:19,00 --> 00:31:25,50
As the cops haul her off, the sergeant sets her abandoned shoes on his desk. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS348
00:31:23,00 --> 00:31:27,50
Now a bus pulls up in an alley. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS349
00:31:25,00 --> 00:31:30,50
Men in US Marshall vests march into view. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS350
00:31:34,00 --> 00:31:40,50
A bald mustached SOMEONE leads a team escorting a hooded prisoner. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS351
00:32:04,00 --> 00:32:09,50
He grabs a thermos. Now at a cell. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS352
00:32:07,00 --> 00:32:13,50
A SOMEONE unhoods a hatchet faced man with wild black hair. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS353
00:32:13,00 --> 00:32:18,50
The prisoner starts to enter the cell then pauses. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS354
00:32:16,00 --> 00:32:22,50
He takes gum from his mouth and sticks it on Warren's badge. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS355
00:32:19,00 --> 00:32:23,50
The SOMEONE smiles. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS356
00:32:28,00 --> 00:32:33,50
He leaves the gum on a crossbar then shuts the door. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS357
00:32:36,00 --> 00:32:41,50
He leaves the coffee thermos with the young SOMEONE. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS358
00:32:38,00 --> 00:32:47,50
Now a heavyset female guard brings a mug with a spoon in it to a cell where SOMEONE snores on a cot. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS359
00:32:44,00 --> 00:32:49,50
The guard leaves the mug on a crossbar. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS360
00:32:47,00 --> 00:32:52,50
As she leaves, the cell block lights blink out. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS361
00:32:51,00 --> 00:32:56,50
SOMEONE promptly sits up. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS362
00:32:54,00 --> 00:33:01,50
Reaching into her shaggy black locks, she pulls out a small hairpin. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS363
00:32:58,00 --> 00:33:03,50
Next she removes her wig, gathers her real hair at the back of her head and ties it in a bun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS365
00:33:04,00 --> 00:33:10,50
From beneath her skirt, she rolls down a pair of black leggings. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS366
00:33:07,00 --> 00:33:12,50
She stands up, peels off the dress, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS367
00:33:09,00 --> 00:33:15,50
removes her bra, and pulls up a stretchy top attached to the leggings. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS368
00:33:16,00 --> 00:33:24,50
Kneeling to the cell door, she picks the lock with her hairpin then tucks it back into her bun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS369
00:33:23,00 --> 00:33:31,50
She stands up, slides the cell door open and eyes a surveillance camera posted in a corner. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS370
00:33:28,00 --> 00:33:36,50
In a security room, a guard reads a newspaper, ignorning several monitors set up before him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS371
00:33:33,00 --> 00:33:39,50
Back in the cell block, SOMEONE pivots the camera. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS372
00:33:36,00 --> 00:33:42,50
At his station, the guard turns on a portable radio. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS373
00:33:41,00 --> 00:33:49,50
He sets it by a monitor showing a view of a shadowy wall, then obliviously picks up his newspaper again. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS374
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:52,50
In the female cell block, SOMEONE takes the spoon from the mug. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS375
00:33:50,00 --> 00:33:55,50
She presses a red button on the wall. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS376
00:33:53,00 --> 00:33:59,50
She slowly opens a door, slips out and shuts it behind her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS377
00:33:56,00 --> 00:34:02,50
Creeping stealthily down a hallway, she reaches a break area. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS378
00:34:04,00 --> 00:34:11,50
She pads across the floor to a water cooler and fills a clear plastic cup. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS379
00:34:12,00 --> 00:34:17,50
Bubbles gurgle up into the water tank. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS380
00:34:15,00 --> 00:34:24,50
SOMEONE cautiously scans her surroundings as she backs away, then faces a door labeled Electrical Room. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS381
00:34:21,00 --> 00:34:27,50
She slips in and opens a cabinet revealing circuit breakers. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS382
00:34:26,00 --> 00:34:33,50
She sets the water on top then climbs a table and opens an air duct on the ceiling. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS383
00:34:32,00 --> 00:34:39,50
Next, she returns to the cabinet and balances the spoon in the circuit breaker. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS384
00:34:36,00 --> 00:34:41,50
She bites a tiny hole in the water cup 

COLOMBIANA_DVS385
00:34:38,00 --> 00:34:43,50
then sets it above the spoon. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS386
00:34:40,00 --> 00:34:45,50
Eyeing her wristwatch, she pushes a button. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS387
00:34:49,00 --> 00:34:53,50
She shuts the cabinet, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS388
00:34:50,00 --> 00:34:56,50
climbs into the air duct, and pulls up the vent cover. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS389
00:34:53,00 --> 00:34:59,50
From a hole in the cup, a drop of water escapes. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS390
00:34:56,00 --> 00:35:01,50
It lands in the spoon which dips slightly. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS391
00:34:58,00 --> 00:35:05,50
SOMEONE crawls through the air duct as more water weighs down the spoon. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS392
00:35:03,00 --> 00:35:09,50
Reaching a grated cover, she peers down at a male prisoner asleep in his cell. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS393
00:35:07,00 --> 00:35:12,50
As she crawls on by, he wakes. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS394
00:35:09,00 --> 00:35:15,50
SOMEONE reaches a large ventilation fan and checks her watch. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS395
00:35:18,00 --> 00:35:23,50
The spoon falls and the water shorts out the fan. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS396
00:35:21,00 --> 00:35:25,50
At his desk, the sergeant looks up. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS397
00:35:31,00 --> 00:35:36,50
In the air duct, the fan slows to a stop. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS398
00:35:34,00 --> 00:35:40,50
SOMEONE lies on her back and slithers her feet between the blades. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS399
00:35:38,00 --> 00:35:44,50
Below, Doyle shuffles into the electrical room and eyes the circuit cabinet. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS400
00:35:43,00 --> 00:35:48,50
A red light glows on its door. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS401
00:35:46,00 --> 00:35:53,50
In the duct, SOMEONE slides her chest between the blades then squeezes her arms down her to side. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS402
00:35:51,00 --> 00:35:57,50
Doyle opens the cabinet as she works her shoulders through the fan. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS403
00:35:55,00 --> 00:35:59,50
He flips a reset switch. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS404
00:35:56,00 --> 00:36:04,50
SOMEONE emerges safely on the other side just as the fan whirs back to life. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS405
00:36:01,00 --> 00:36:07,50
The policeman finds the plastic cup and shakes his head at it. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS406
00:36:05,00 --> 00:36:11,50
As SOMEONE crawls onward, Doyle chucks the cup in the trash. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS407
00:36:08,00 --> 00:36:15,50
Now the intruder lowers a ceiling vent hatch and stealthily climbs out. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS408
00:36:14,00 --> 00:36:20,50
In the secure cell block, SOMEONE finds his coffee thermos empty. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS409
00:36:18,00 --> 00:36:22,50
He checks on SOMEONE. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS410
00:36:23,00 --> 00:36:30,50
Finding the prisoner asleep, he shuffles to the cell block door and pushes a button. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS411
00:36:27,00 --> 00:36:32,50
He wakes the guard in the security room. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS412
00:36:31,00 --> 00:36:35,50
He buzzes SOMEONE through. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS413
00:36:32,00 --> 00:36:39,50
Later in a men's room, the young SOMEONE sets the thermos on a sink and crosses to a urinal. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS414
00:36:37,00 --> 00:36:44,50
As he relieves himself, SOMEONE slips out of the stall and creeps up behind him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS415
00:36:44,00 --> 00:36:49,50
She kicks him as he turns, knocking him out cold. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS416
00:36:47,00 --> 00:36:51,50
Now in the security room. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS417
00:36:49,00 --> 00:36:57,50
A monitor shows SOMEONE standing at the door to the secure cell block with his face hidden by his arshal's cap. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS418
00:36:54,00 --> 00:36:59,50
The guard buzzes him through. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS419
00:36:56,00 --> 00:37:03,50
As the door opens, the unconscious SOMEONE sinks to his knees then falls face down. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS420
00:37:01,00 --> 00:37:08,50
Crouched in the hallway, SOMEONE creeps in after him and gently pushes the door shut. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS421
00:37:07,00 --> 00:37:11,50
She takes SOMEONE's gun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS422
00:37:08,00 --> 00:37:13,50
Checking the clip, she finds it fully loaded. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS423
00:37:13,00 --> 00:37:20,50
She stands, holding the weapon pointed at the floor, and moves to SOMEONE's cell. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS424
00:37:17,00 --> 00:37:22,50
The prisoner sleeps sprawled on the cot. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS425
00:37:20,00 --> 00:37:25,50
SOMEONE slides the door open and saunters in. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS426
00:37:24,00 --> 00:37:30,50
She leans over SOMEONE, pointing the gun at his chest. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS427
00:37:27,00 --> 00:37:33,50
Tilting her head, she nudges the barrel against his brow. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS428
00:37:30,00 --> 00:37:35,50
SOMEONE wakes with a start and sits up. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS429
00:37:41,00 --> 00:37:47,50
The hatchet faced criminal hastily opens his gaudy shirt. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS430
00:37:49,00 --> 00:37:59,50
In a corridor, SOMEONE and the desk sergeant halt in their tracks. Blood splatters the wall behind SOMEONE as he collapses. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS431
00:38:00,00 --> 00:38:07,50
SOMEONE leads the charge as cops converge on the cell block from all over the station. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS432
00:38:08,00 --> 00:38:14,50
As they enter the cell block, SOMEONE wakes with a gun in his hand. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS433
00:38:11,00 --> 00:38:18,50
He notices the weapon and stares. SOMEONE takes aim at him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS434
00:38:21,00 --> 00:38:27,50
SOMEONE surrenders the gun and his fellow marshals restrain him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS435
00:38:24,00 --> 00:38:32,50
SOMEONE's dead body bears an orchid design drawn on his chest underneath the word traitor. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS436
00:38:34,00 --> 00:38:40,50
SOMEONE leads his men through a sweep of the station. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS437
00:38:38,00 --> 00:38:45,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE kicks open a grated vent cover leading her outside. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS438
00:38:42,00 --> 00:39:00,50
In the alley, officers run past the prison bus. Several stories above, SOMEONE climbs out of the duct and clings to the wall. The officers hurry up a set of emergency access stairs. SOMEONE stretches her leg up to a shoulder high ledge. As she climbs, the officers arrive on the rooftop. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS439
00:38:59,00 --> 00:39:03,50
She reaches the top ledge. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS440
00:39:01,00 --> 00:39:06,50
Her feet scramble up the brick wall, propelling her over. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS441
00:39:04,00 --> 00:39:08,50
Landing in a crouch, she spots the police across the rooftop. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS443
00:39:08,00 --> 00:39:12,50
She breaks into a sprint. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS444
00:39:15,00 --> 00:39:22,50
Crossing to the roof's edge, she leaps over and grabs onto a pipe just beneath the other side. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS445
00:39:20,00 --> 00:39:25,50
Her toes touch down on a slim ledge. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS446
00:39:23,00 --> 00:39:30,50
She starts to reach up but withdraws her hand as an officer arrives above her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS447
00:39:31,00 --> 00:39:36,50
He sweeps his flashlight over the edge. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS448
00:39:33,00 --> 00:39:40,50
Flattening herself against the wall, SOMEONE evades his detection. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS449
00:39:37,00 --> 00:39:42,50
The cop leaves and she pulls herself up. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS450
00:39:39,00 --> 00:39:46,50
Her legs accidentally sweep tiny bits of mortar off the ledge. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS451
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:50,50
The SOMEONE lands behind two cops in an alley who turn and look up. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS452
00:39:50,00 --> 00:39:56,50
SOMEONE pulls herself into an air duct as an officer comes over. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS453
00:39:55,00 --> 00:40:03,50
Back in the women's cell block, she kicks open a ceiling vent cover and lowers herself to the floor. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS454
00:40:01,00 --> 00:40:06,50
She hurries to her cell and shuts herself in. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS455
00:40:03,00 --> 00:40:10,50
The heavyset female officer arrives with SOMEONE Warren and his men. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS456
00:40:08,00 --> 00:40:12,50
He stops at SOMEONE's cell. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS457
00:40:10,00 --> 00:40:16,50
Back in her party girl disguise, she lies curled up on her cot. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS458
00:40:15,00 --> 00:40:21,50
SOMEONE Warren turns away and faces the desk sergeant. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS459
00:40:21,00 --> 00:40:26,50
He leads the local police out of the cell block. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS461
00:40:25,00 --> 00:40:29,50
SOMEONE's eyes open and she rolls over. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS462
00:40:31,00 --> 00:40:38,50
Now a middle aged man in a dark suit squints in the sunlight as he steps off a private jet. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS463
00:40:36,00 --> 00:40:43,50
Accompanied by a small team of associates, he meets SOMEONE Warren and his men. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS464
00:40:46,00 --> 00:40:53,50
We glimpse an FBI jacket as the two teams approach a pair of waiting SUVs. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS465
00:40:50,00 --> 00:40:56,50
Now in a morgue, a body bag lies on a slab. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS466
00:40:54,00 --> 00:41:00,50
Agent SOMEONE opens it, revealing SOMEONE's chest. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS467
00:40:59,00 --> 00:41:05,50
He eyes the markings then faces a tall powerfully built colleague. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS468
00:41:07,00 --> 00:41:12,50
He glances at SOMEONE Warren who nods. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS469
00:41:13,00 --> 00:41:19,50
At the station, Doyle takes SOMEONE's fingerprints. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS470
00:41:25,00 --> 00:41:30,50
The sergeant glances past her and she turns. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS472
00:41:39,00 --> 00:41:46,50
From the security camera's point of view, SOMEONE's wig hides her face. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS473
00:41:43,00 --> 00:41:49,50
Outside, Agent SOMEONE and SOMEONE Warren exit a car. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS474
00:41:48,00 --> 00:41:55,50
Reporters and photographers swarm them as they walk upstairs to the open front door. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS475
00:42:09,00 --> 00:42:14,50
SOMEONE slips out unnoticed. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS476
00:42:12,00 --> 00:42:20,50
The station doors shut as she reaches the sidewalk and peels a rubbery substance off her right hand. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS477
00:42:18,00 --> 00:42:23,50
Passing between two parked press vans, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS478
00:42:20,00 --> 00:42:25,50
she drops it on the pavement. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS479
00:42:22,00 --> 00:42:29,50
Now SOMEONE Warren watches, arms folded, as SOMEONE stands in SOMEONE's cell. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS480
00:42:27,00 --> 00:42:35,50
Facing the cop, the FBI agent aims an imaginary gun and visualizes the murdered criminal. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS481
00:42:32,00 --> 00:42:38,50
He looks up with a furrowed brow at the sizable vent cover 

COLOMBIANA_DVS482
00:42:35,00 --> 00:42:42,50
then peers down at the cot again and backs up toward the cell door. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS483
00:42:48,00 --> 00:42:54,50
He steps out of the cell and notices the surveillance camera. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS484
00:42:58,00 --> 00:43:04,50
Now a video camera captures SOMEONE entering a lobby. She discreetly brushes her hair over her face as she crosses the polished floor. Glass doors behind her show a bus parked at a curb. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS485
00:43:02,00 --> 00:43:09,50
She enters an employee locker room. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS488
00:43:11,00 --> 00:43:17,50
She opens a locker, and pulls out a purse and a travel bag. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS489
00:43:15,00 --> 00:43:19,50
Now she enters a bathroom stall. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS490
00:43:17,00 --> 00:43:22,50
She removes her wig and lets down her hair, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS491
00:43:19,00 --> 00:43:27,50
then kicks off her high heeled party girl shoes and wriggles out of the tight mini dress. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS492
00:43:24,00 --> 00:43:29,50
Later, the stall door swings open. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS493
00:43:26,00 --> 00:43:33,50
A blonde woman turns from a mirror as a now casually dressed SOMEONE emerges. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS494
00:43:31,00 --> 00:43:37,50
The assassin steps out into the hall and looks both ways. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS495
00:43:35,00 --> 00:43:40,50
She puts on a floppy knit hat then strides off. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS496
00:43:39,00 --> 00:43:47,50
At home, SOMEONE answers a cordless phone. On the other end, SOMEONE stands at a payphone. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS497
00:44:01,00 --> 00:44:07,50
She hangs up, runs to the bus, and turns in her ticket. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS498
00:44:05,00 --> 00:44:09,50
In an FBI office. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS499
00:44:34,00 --> 00:44:41,50
Now a black luxury car approaches a mansion nestled among palm trees. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS500
00:44:38,00 --> 00:44:45,50
A cigarette smolders between a bodyguard's fingers as he turns and lifts his chin. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS501
00:44:43,00 --> 00:44:47,50
The car comes to a stop. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS502
00:44:44,00 --> 00:44:51,50
A Caucasian man with chestnut hair gets out. A figure stalks toward him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS503
00:45:06,00 --> 00:45:13,50
SOMEONE goes to SOMEONE and shows a newspaper covering SOMEONE's death. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS504
00:45:28,00 --> 00:45:33,50
SOMEONE swirls a snifter of brandy. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS505
00:45:35,00 --> 00:45:40,50
SOMEONE gestures and SOMEONE sits facing him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS506
00:45:56,00 --> 00:46:01,50
He throws down the newspaper. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS507
00:46:02,00 --> 00:46:06,50
He stands. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS508
00:46:03,00 --> 00:46:10,50
From around a corner, SOMEONE watches him swagger out, then approaches SOMEONE. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS509
00:46:07,00 --> 00:46:15,50
His boss exhales a plume of smoke as he crosses to a railing and gazes out over his grounds. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS510
00:46:13,00 --> 00:46:18,50
SOMEONE arrives at his side and leans against a pillar. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS511
00:46:34,00 --> 00:46:39,50
In Chicago, our view soars over skyscrapers. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS512
00:46:37,00 --> 00:46:44,50
Inside Union Station, SOMEONE walks down stairs into the sunlit great hall. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS513
00:46:42,00 --> 00:46:50,50
She pauses, most of her hair tucked under a hat and her features disguised by large sunglasses pushing them up on her nose, she crosses the sunny atrium. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS514
00:46:48,00 --> 00:46:54,50
Now she enters an apartment. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS515
00:46:51,00 --> 00:46:55,50
Two walls of frosted glass make a small foyer. SOMEONE pauses cautiously. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS516
00:46:53,00 --> 00:46:58,50
then shuts the door. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS518
00:46:58,00 --> 00:47:04,50
SOMEONE goes to a table, and puts down her things. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS519
00:47:02,00 --> 00:47:07,50
She pulls off her hat then removes her flannel shirt, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS520
00:47:05,00 --> 00:47:09,50
revealing a loose fitting tank top. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS521
00:47:07,00 --> 00:47:14,50
Brushing back her long hair, she opens a brown paper bag. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS522
00:47:12,00 --> 00:47:19,50
She takes out a cup of noodles. She eats some with her hands as she crosses to a complex media console 

COLOMBIANA_DVS523
00:47:16,00 --> 00:47:21,50
where she turns on a set of security monitors. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS524
00:47:23,00 --> 00:47:31,50
Scanning the feeds, she plucks out some more noodles, tilts her head back, then drops some into her mouth. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS525
00:47:33,00 --> 00:47:40,50
She sets the cup down then claps her hands and raises her arms above her head. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS526
00:47:37,00 --> 00:47:46,50
The live young assassin swivels her hips with sensual grace as she dances her way into a living area. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS527
00:47:43,00 --> 00:47:53,50
To her right, a large square painting depicting a pink SOMEONE orchid at the center of a gold rimmed medallion stands propped against the wall. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS528
00:47:51,00 --> 00:47:56,50
She looks at it for a moment then dances away. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS529
00:47:54,00 --> 00:48:01,50
In a cage, a finch on a perch ruffles its feathers as its owner sashays across the room. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS530
00:47:59,00 --> 00:48:04,50
SOMEONE sets down a handgun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS531
00:48:01,00 --> 00:48:07,50
Now we watch from overhead as she gets into the shower. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS532
00:48:04,00 --> 00:48:10,50
She plants her hands on the wall and bows her head. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS533
00:48:08,00 --> 00:48:14,50
Water drips from her pendant then streams down her nose, lips, and chin. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS534
00:48:12,00 --> 00:48:19,50
She briskly soaps up her flawless skin and shifts her weary gaze. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS535
00:48:17,00 --> 00:48:21,50
Later, she sucks on a lollipop 

COLOMBIANA_DVS536
00:48:18,00 --> 00:48:22,50
as she cleans her handgun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS537
00:48:20,00 --> 00:48:27,50
She sets the weapon down and turns away, twirling the candy in her mouth. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS538
00:48:25,00 --> 00:48:30,50
At the FBI, Agent SOMEONE gives a briefing. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS539
00:48:44,00 --> 00:48:49,50
A blonde woman gets strangled in a restroom. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS540
00:48:55,00 --> 00:49:00,50
The killer electrocutes a man taking a bath. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS541
00:49:02,00 --> 00:49:06,50
The killer shoots them. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS542
00:49:05,00 --> 00:49:11,50
Agent SOMEONE sits down at his desk and plays the prison security footage. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS543
00:49:24,00 --> 00:49:29,50
A female agent distributes clipboards. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS544
00:49:57,00 --> 00:50:04,50
At night, a man with broodingly handsome features gets out of a parked car. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS545
00:50:01,00 --> 00:50:09,50
Now an elevator opens and he steps out, toting a portfolio and a sack full of canvases. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS546
00:50:07,00 --> 00:50:14,50
Arriving at a door, he takes out his keys before noticing that it's ajar. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS547
00:50:11,00 --> 00:50:17,50
He cautiously looks down the hall then steps into a dark apartment. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS548
00:50:15,00 --> 00:50:21,50
A single lamp shines on sketches taped all over the walls 

COLOMBIANA_DVS549
00:50:18,00 --> 00:50:23,50
and candles burn throughout the cluttered space. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS550
00:50:21,00 --> 00:50:28,50
The man steps further in, passing an electric fan and a jar of paintbrushes. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS551
00:50:28,00 --> 00:50:35,50
He halts and turns around to find SOMEONE watching him from a leather sofa. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS552
00:50:34,00 --> 00:50:38,50
She switches on the lights. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS553
00:50:37,00 --> 00:50:43,50
She smiles, springs up, and greets him with a hungry kiss. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS554
00:50:41,00 --> 00:50:47,50
His arms envelope her and his hands travel down her back. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS555
00:50:44,00 --> 00:50:51,50
SOMEONE abruptly ends the kiss and faces a stylized portrait of an old man. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS556
00:50:57,00 --> 00:51:05,50
SOMEONE peels off his jacket then removes her own as she resumes their embrace. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS557
00:51:02,00 --> 00:51:07,50
SOMEONE gently takes hold of her wrists. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS558
00:51:17,00 --> 00:51:25,50
Grinning, she pulls her dress off over her head to reveal her black bra and matching panties. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS559
00:51:22,00 --> 00:51:28,50
She plants a kiss on SOMEONE's lips then removes his t-shirt. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS560
00:51:26,00 --> 00:51:31,50
His tattooed arms wrap around her 

COLOMBIANA_DVS561
00:51:28,00 --> 00:51:32,50
and he lifts her up. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS562
00:51:29,00 --> 00:51:35,50
SOMEONE's legs grip his waist as he carries her to the sofa. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS563
00:51:33,00 --> 00:51:38,50
He sits with her straddling his lap. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS564
00:51:35,00 --> 00:51:44,50
She lifts her head ecstatically and tilts it side to side as the handsome artist nibbles her neck and kisses her chest. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS565
00:51:42,00 --> 00:51:49,50
Now he sleeps curled up in bed while SOMEONE lies awake at his side. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS566
00:51:46,00 --> 00:51:51,50
She gingerly sits up. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS568
00:51:54,00 --> 00:51:58,50
She puts on her bra. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS569
00:51:55,00 --> 00:52:01,50
Padding into the living area, she picks her dress up off the floor and pulls it on. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS570
00:51:58,00 --> 00:52:04,50
In bed, sunlight shines softly on SOMEONE's sleeping form. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS571
00:52:04,00 --> 00:52:09,50
He reaches an arm behind him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS572
00:52:06,00 --> 00:52:12,50
His hand hits SOMEONE's side of the bed and finds it unoccupied. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS573
00:52:10,00 --> 00:52:18,50
Now in a humble Chicago neighborhood, SOMEONE rides a red motorcycle with chrome trim. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS574
00:52:15,00 --> 00:52:23,50
Turning, he pulls up onto a sidewalk and parks beneath an overhanging roof at a building's entrance. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS575
00:52:21,00 --> 00:52:28,50
He steps inside a laundromat through a pair of glass doors covered in newspaper. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS576
00:52:25,00 --> 00:52:33,50
He glances at a blonde woman who sits reading near a similarly blanketed window. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS577
00:52:30,00 --> 00:52:37,50
Looking around, he moves to a coin operated washing machine and starts a load. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS578
00:52:34,00 --> 00:52:38,50
He sits down. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS579
00:52:36,00 --> 00:52:40,50
SOMEONE sits beside him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS580
00:52:55,00 --> 00:53:02,50
SOMEONE shows a magazine cover featuring a portly bald man. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS581
00:53:20,00 --> 00:53:25,50
She accepts an envelope stuffed with large bills. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS582
00:53:25,00 --> 00:53:32,50
Gathering up her bags, she pauses and turns. SOMEONE holds up a newspaper clipping. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS583
00:53:32,00 --> 00:53:40,50
An article on SOMEONE Rizzo's death shows a photo of the orchid design on his chest. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS584
00:55:02,00 --> 00:55:10,50
SOMEONE gives a weary shrug then leans forward and rests his elbows on his legs. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS585
00:55:09,00 --> 00:55:14,50
Our focus shifts to his niece as she leans forward as well. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS586
00:55:17,00 --> 00:55:21,50
SOMEONE avoids her gaze. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS587
00:55:19,00 --> 00:55:26,50
She reaches out a dainty hand and affectionately wraps it around one of his fingers. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS588
00:55:24,00 --> 00:55:31,50
Now in the FBI office, Agent SOMEONE studies a transparency of SOMEONE's drawing. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS589
00:55:29,00 --> 00:55:33,50
The office mail man notices it. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS590
00:55:47,00 --> 00:55:54,50
Agent SOMEONE sets down the transparency and types at his computer. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS591
00:55:51,00 --> 00:55:56,50
An image of the orchid appears. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS592
00:55:53,00 --> 00:55:59,50
The agent holds up the drawing and finds that it matches perfectly. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS593
00:55:57,00 --> 00:56:02,50
He types some more and turns up a map of Amazonia. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS594
00:56:03,00 --> 00:56:08,50
A message appears, "Access denied." 

COLOMBIANA_DVS595
00:56:09,00 --> 00:56:13,50
He sits back in his chair. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS596
00:56:11,00 --> 00:56:16,50
Now SOMEONE approaches two caged mastiffs. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS597
00:56:20,00 --> 00:56:25,50
She enters their fenced in area. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS598
00:56:30,00 --> 00:56:34,50
She shows a steak. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS599
00:56:39,00 --> 00:56:44,50
She places a steak in each of their bowls. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS600
00:56:41,00 --> 00:56:48,50
Stepping out from the cage, she closes the door and gives them a firm look. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS601
00:56:48,00 --> 00:56:52,50
The mastiffs rush to their bowls. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS602
00:56:50,00 --> 00:56:59,50
Nearby, a long haired mechanic works on a car. SOMEONE touches a wind chime made from tire rims as she enters the garage. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS603
00:57:00,00 --> 00:57:05,50
She kisses Pepe's cheek. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS604
00:57:05,00 --> 00:57:11,50
She opens a tall safe standing against a wall. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS605
00:57:08,00 --> 00:57:13,50
Taking out a stack of money, she fans through it 

COLOMBIANA_DVS606
00:57:11,00 --> 00:57:17,50
then examines four different passports and settles on a Mexican one. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS607
00:57:15,00 --> 00:57:21,50
Now our view glides over a mansion with a Paris styled courtyard at its center. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS608
00:57:19,00 --> 00:57:25,50
A bodyguard patrols the estate with an automatic rifle. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS609
00:57:22,00 --> 00:57:30,50
A woman in sexy lingerie reclines on top of a pool enclosed in glass panels. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS610
00:57:27,00 --> 00:57:32,50
Sharks swim in the water beneath her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS611
00:57:36,00 --> 00:57:41,50
Lounging with two women, the SOMEONE laughs. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS612
00:57:52,00 --> 00:57:59,50
That night, four women in their underwear accompany him to a bedroom. He turns to a bodyguard. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS613
00:58:06,00 --> 00:58:14,50
SOMEONE winks and pats the guard's face, then turns to the women who pillow fight on his canopy bed. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS614
00:58:14,00 --> 00:58:21,50
He frames his crotch with his hands then hurries over and belly flops onto the bed. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS615
00:58:19,00 --> 00:58:25,50
Outside, a van pulls into the estate and stops in front of the mansion. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS616
00:58:23,00 --> 00:58:29,50
Several bodyguards get out and SOMEONE approaches them. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS617
00:58:34,00 --> 00:58:39,50
The bodyguards file into the mansion. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS618
00:58:37,00 --> 00:58:41,50
As SOMEONE supervises the men, SOMEONE rolls out from the under the van just before it pulls away. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS620
00:58:43,00 --> 00:58:50,50
The head security guard steps into the mansion and closes the door. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS621
00:58:47,00 --> 00:58:54,50
SOMEONE scurries to another entrance and creeps into a dark foyer. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS622
00:58:51,00 --> 00:58:57,50
An oblivious bodyguard stands at a window holding a handgun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS623
00:58:55,00 --> 00:59:01,50
In the courtyard, a guard puffs on a cigarette then heads inside. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS624
00:58:58,00 --> 00:59:05,50
A view through the pool's glass panels shows a shark gliding through the pale blue water. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS625
00:59:03,00 --> 00:59:09,50
As it swims away, a hand appears under the glass. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS626
00:59:06,00 --> 00:59:15,50
Wearing a black short sleeved leotard and a utility belt, SOMEONE pulls herself along the panels. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS627
00:59:12,00 --> 00:59:19,50
Two sharks swim nearby paying little attention to the graceful intruder. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS628
00:59:17,00 --> 00:59:24,50
SOMEONE nears the opposite end of the pool and pushes up one of the thick glass panels. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS629
00:59:22,00 --> 00:59:27,50
Gripping its edge, she slides it away. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS630
00:59:24,00 --> 00:59:30,50
Her head breaks the water's surface and she peers into the courtyard. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS631
00:59:31,00 --> 00:59:37,50
Pushing herself out of the pool, she draws a gun at her hip. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS632
00:59:35,00 --> 00:59:41,50
She glances around as she screws a silencer onto its barrel. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS633
00:59:41,00 --> 00:59:48,50
With her fingers curled around the gun's handle, she hurries into the mansion. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS634
00:59:45,00 --> 00:59:53,50
In his bedroom, the portly scam artist sleeps amid his scantily clad companions. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS635
00:59:50,00 --> 00:59:58,50
SOMEONE marches quietly toward the bed, water still glistening on her slender neck. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS636
00:59:55,00 --> 01:00:01,50
She carries the gun at her side, her finger crooked around the trigger. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS637
00:59:59,00 --> 01:00:07,50
Halting a few yards from the foot of the bed, she regards the Ponzi schemer with a cold determined gaze. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS638
01:00:05,00 --> 01:00:12,50
As she aims her weapon, a blonde snuggles up to the portly man in her sleep 

COLOMBIANA_DVS639
01:00:09,00 --> 01:00:14,50
draping herself across his chest. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS640
01:00:11,00 --> 01:00:19,50
Our view arcs around SOMEONE's gun until the silencer muzzle aims right at us. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS641
01:00:16,00 --> 01:00:21,50
A bright golden flash clouds our view. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS642
01:00:20,00 --> 01:00:26,50
SOMEONE bolts upright then looks down at his bare chest. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS643
01:00:25,00 --> 01:00:32,50
He finds the words thief written in black lipstick above a drawing of the SOMEONE orchid. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS644
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:35,50
With his brow creased worriedly, he tries to rub it off 

COLOMBIANA_DVS645
01:00:32,00 --> 01:00:38,50
then glances around and scoots off the bed. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS646
01:00:39,00 --> 01:00:46,50
In the hall, he finds a bodyguard lying on the floor with a pool of blood by his head. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS647
01:00:44,00 --> 01:00:49,50
Another guard lies dead beside him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS648
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:53,50
Staring cautiously, SOMEONE grabs a gun resting in one of men's hands. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS649
01:00:53,00 --> 01:01:01,50
His bare legs tremble slightly as he moves down a dark corridor past another dead bodyguard. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS650
01:00:58,00 --> 01:01:06,50
He creeps down a flight of stairs, then presses his back to a wall as he reaches the bottom. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS651
01:01:03,00 --> 01:01:09,50
Bending over another dead bodyguard, he takes his gun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS652
01:01:07,00 --> 01:01:13,50
Armed with a pistol in each hand, he steps into the courtyard. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS653
01:01:13,00 --> 01:01:19,50
He notices a flower resting three panels away on the pool's glass. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS654
01:01:21,00 --> 01:01:27,50
His nervous eyes scan the area as he walks across the pool. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS655
01:01:28,00 --> 01:01:36,50
Stopping in front of the SOMEONE orchid, he picks it up and squints as he examines it. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS656
01:01:34,00 --> 01:01:41,50
He lifts the flower to his nose, closes his eyes, and takes a sniff. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS657
01:01:45,00 --> 01:01:51,50
Opening his eyes, he smirks as he lifts his face from the flower. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS658
01:01:48,00 --> 01:01:54,50
SOMEONE rises from a chair in the portico behind him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS659
01:01:52,00 --> 01:01:57,50
SOMEONE shakes his head as he turns to face her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS660
01:01:58,00 --> 01:02:04,50
He fires one gun then the other but finds them both empty. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS661
01:02:07,00 --> 01:02:13,50
She shoots him in his leg and he sinks to one knee. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS662
01:02:10,00 --> 01:02:16,50
A shot to his other leg sends him down on all fours. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS663
01:02:21,00 --> 01:02:26,50
He glances at the sharks below him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS664
01:02:27,00 --> 01:02:34,50
SOMEONE shoots him in the shoulder and he tumbles into the uncovered gap in the panel. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS665
01:02:31,00 --> 01:02:38,50
As the sharks attack, he flails and grabs futily at the glass. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS666
01:02:35,00 --> 01:02:40,50
His blood billows in the water. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS667
01:02:38,00 --> 01:02:45,50
Walking onto the glass, SOMEONE picks up the orchid and drops it into the pool. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS669
01:02:43,00 --> 01:02:49,50
In his office, SOMEONE reads a newspaper's front page. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS670
01:02:46,00 --> 01:02:54,50
A photo displays the bloody swimming pool and a caption reads, "Sharks eat shark." 

COLOMBIANA_DVS671
01:02:54,00 --> 01:02:59,50
With a scowl, SOMEONE answers his phone. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS672
01:03:37,00 --> 01:03:41,50
He slams down the receiver. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS673
01:03:41,00 --> 01:03:47,50
Agent SOMEONE hangs up. Now a plane soars overhead. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS674
01:03:45,00 --> 01:03:52,50
Later at an airport, a woman and a goateed man follow SOMEONE past a baggage claim area. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS675
01:04:03,00 --> 01:04:08,50
SOMEONE pockets his cellphone. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS676
01:04:05,00 --> 01:04:12,50
He and his two bodyguards stride outside to a pick up area where a car awaits. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS677
01:04:19,00 --> 01:04:24,50
He climbs into the front passenger seat. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS678
01:04:21,00 --> 01:04:27,50
Now SOMEONE descends a staircase from a train platform. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS679
01:04:25,00 --> 01:04:31,50
As a man passes, she bows her head, letting her hair shield her face. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS680
01:04:29,00 --> 01:04:33,50
Later, she enters SOMEONE's apartment. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS681
01:04:31,00 --> 01:04:36,50
Walking past easels and paint supplies, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS682
01:04:33,00 --> 01:04:40,50
she spots the painting of the elderly man resting off to the side. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS683
01:04:37,00 --> 01:04:43,50
A drop cloth covers half of the canvas. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS684
01:04:40,00 --> 01:04:45,50
SOMEONE reads a note written in a sketchbook. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS685
01:04:55,00 --> 01:05:01,50
She slides off her jacket and falls back on his bed. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS686
01:04:59,00 --> 01:05:03,50
Her fingers fidgets with the orchid pendant around her neck. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS687
01:05:00,00 --> 01:05:06,50
as she stares up at the ceiling. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS688
01:05:06,00 --> 01:05:12,50
She turns on to her side, adjusting the pillow under her head 

COLOMBIANA_DVS689
01:05:10,00 --> 01:05:16,50
and notices one of SOMEONE's shirts lying on top of the covers. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS690
01:05:13,00 --> 01:05:18,50
Lifting it to her face, she smells it 

COLOMBIANA_DVS691
01:05:15,00 --> 01:05:22,50
then draws it into her arms and clutches it against her chest. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS692
01:05:20,00 --> 01:05:24,50
At the FBI office. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS694
01:05:26,00 --> 01:05:32,50
Two clips show SOMEONE at the police station, her face obscured. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS695
01:05:36,00 --> 01:05:43,50
Agent SOMEONE hits a command on his computer then sips from a travel mug. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS696
01:05:41,00 --> 01:05:51,50
As a laser like line scans down the image of SOMEONE, a message on the monitor blinks, "Morphological analysis." 

COLOMBIANA_DVS697
01:05:48,00 --> 01:05:54,50
A data match calculator runs above 13%. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS698
01:05:54,00 --> 01:06:00,50
At night, lights from Chicago's skyscrapers glimmer on the horizon. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS700
01:05:59,00 --> 01:06:05,50
In SOMEONE's apartment, SOMEONE pours red wine into a glass. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS701
01:06:02,00 --> 01:06:07,50
Lit candles around the room give it a warm glow. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS702
01:06:06,00 --> 01:06:13,50
SOMEONE glances over as her artist boyfriend comes home. She breaks into a smile. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS703
01:06:13,00 --> 01:06:17,50
She offers a glass. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS704
01:06:17,00 --> 01:06:22,50
She gives him a kiss then takes his hand. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS705
01:06:22,00 --> 01:06:28,50
He gazes at food on a nearby table then sits facing her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS706
01:06:30,00 --> 01:06:36,50
From a bag, she produces a plush alligator and hands it to him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS707
01:06:38,00 --> 01:06:43,50
Smiling, she steps closer. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS708
01:06:40,00 --> 01:06:46,50
She kisses SOMEONE lustfully, running her fingers through his hair. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS710
01:06:47,00 --> 01:06:52,50
He gently pushes her away and she takes a seat in front of him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS711
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:45,50
SOMEONE looks away. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS712
01:07:46,00 --> 01:07:51,50
She stares off, her eyes shining with tears. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS713
01:07:48,00 --> 01:07:53,50
then gives a small shake of her head. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS714
01:08:10,00 --> 01:08:16,50
Blinking her woeful eyes, she opens her mouth to speak 

COLOMBIANA_DVS715
01:08:13,00 --> 01:08:18,50
then turns away and rests her elbow on the table. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS716
01:08:17,00 --> 01:08:21,50
She leans her head on her hands. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS717
01:08:29,00 --> 01:08:36,50
Tilting her head, she rumples her lips then grazes them with her fingers as her eyes fill with tears. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS718
01:08:34,00 --> 01:08:39,50
She glances back at SOMEONE 

COLOMBIANA_DVS719
01:08:36,00 --> 01:08:40,50
who flashes a tight smile. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS720
01:08:40,00 --> 01:08:45,50
SOMEONE breaks into a grin. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS721
01:08:43,00 --> 01:08:48,50
She leans closer and presses her lips to SOMEONE's. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS722
01:08:46,00 --> 01:08:51,50
As her kisses grow more passionate, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS723
01:08:48,00 --> 01:08:53,50
SOMEONE grabs her arms and holds her at bay. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS724
01:08:53,00 --> 01:08:58,50
Under his steady gaze, she gives a yielding look. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS727
01:09:01,00 --> 01:09:11,50
She raises her arms letting him lift off her shirt. He sets it aside. With both hands, he brushes SOMEONE's hair away from her face, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS728
01:09:08,00 --> 01:09:13,50
then leans forward and places a gentle peck on her cheek. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS729
01:09:10,00 --> 01:09:15,50
As he sprinkles her with more kisses, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS730
01:09:14,00 --> 01:09:21,50
she nuzzles her head against his. The next morning, the stuffed alligator sits on a table in front of a tray holding glasses of orange juice, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS731
01:09:19,00 --> 01:09:24,50
coffee mugs, and two plates of food. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS732
01:09:21,00 --> 01:09:26,50
Spotting the plush gift, SOMEONE picks it up. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS733
01:09:26,00 --> 01:09:33,50
He glances toward the bedroom where SOMEONE lies asleep under rumpled covers. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS734
01:09:30,00 --> 01:09:37,50
Grabbing his phone, he heads over and gazes down at the slumbering beauty. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS735
01:09:35,00 --> 01:09:39,50
He snaps a photo. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS736
01:09:38,00 --> 01:09:44,50
He dances the alligator in front of SOMEONE. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS737
01:09:45,00 --> 01:09:49,50
She jumps up. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS738
01:09:53,00 --> 01:09:57,50
She dresses. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS739
01:10:10,00 --> 01:10:16,50
SOMEONE looks out a window with a frustrated look. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS740
01:10:13,00 --> 01:10:19,50
Now SOMEONE strides down an aisle in a used book store. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS741
01:10:16,00 --> 01:10:20,50
Turning a corner, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS742
01:10:17,00 --> 01:10:21,50
she finds SOMEONE reading a newspaper. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS743
01:10:20,00 --> 01:10:24,50
He hurls the newspaper at her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS744
01:10:23,00 --> 01:10:27,50
She lowers her gaze to a headline. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS745
01:10:39,00 --> 01:10:43,50
He presses her against a shelf. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS746
01:11:04,00 --> 01:11:08,50
He starts to leave. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS747
01:11:07,00 --> 01:11:11,50
He pauses. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS748
01:11:11,00 --> 01:11:16,50
He turns and glares at her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS749
01:11:47,00 --> 01:11:53,50
She wipes away tears as he steps over to her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS750
01:12:11,00 --> 01:12:18,50
He slaps a folded paper into her palm, wraps her fingers around it, and presses it to her chest. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS751
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:23,50
As he leaves, she opens the paper and sees it's an old photo of herself with her parents. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS752
01:12:23,00 --> 01:12:30,50
Cupping a hand over her mouth, she sits on a bench then kicks the shelf in front of her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS753
01:12:30,00 --> 01:12:34,50
She hangs her head. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS754
01:12:34,00 --> 01:12:38,50
Her shoulders tremble. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS755
01:12:36,00 --> 01:12:42,50
Now rain pours on a small cafe across the street from us. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS756
01:13:10,00 --> 01:13:14,50
His friend's eyes light up. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS757
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:22,50
He shows the photo on his cell. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS758
01:13:24,00 --> 01:13:29,50
He spots a meter maid by his car. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS759
01:13:28,00 --> 01:13:32,50
He hurries outside. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS760
01:13:32,00 --> 01:13:39,50
His friend grabs his left behind phone off the table and makes a call with it. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS762
01:13:44,00 --> 01:13:49,50
In a police station, SOMEONE pulls it up on her computer. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS763
01:14:17,00 --> 01:14:24,50
She types. Her computer runs the photo through a database. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS764
01:14:27,00 --> 01:14:32,50
SOMEONE hangs up then glances outside at his friend. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS765
01:14:30,00 --> 01:14:35,50
He sets the cellphone back on the table. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS767
01:14:39,00 --> 01:14:46,50
In the FBI office, a message appears on Agent SOMEONE's computer, "Alert, database, new element." 

COLOMBIANA_DVS768
01:14:44,00 --> 01:14:48,50
He makes a phone call. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS769
01:14:49,00 --> 01:14:55,50
He hangs up and types a command into his computer. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS770
01:14:53,00 --> 01:15:00,50
A satellite map of Chicago appears then zooms in several times. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS771
01:14:57,00 --> 01:15:04,50
The trace hones in on a building and a label reads, "Third Precinct, Chicago, Illinois." 

COLOMBIANA_DVS772
01:15:01,00 --> 01:15:06,50
Agent SOMEONE makes another phone call. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS773
01:15:08,00 --> 01:15:15,50
In Chicago, we soar through the tall buildings, skimming a white steeple set with a gold cross. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS774
01:15:13,00 --> 01:15:19,50
In the spacious cathedral, congregants fill the pews. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS775
01:15:16,00 --> 01:15:23,50
Among them sit SOMEONE and Mama who murmurs a prayer under her breath. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS776
01:15:20,00 --> 01:15:24,50
SOMEONE arrives 

COLOMBIANA_DVS777
01:15:21,00 --> 01:15:26,50
wearing her large sunglasses. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS778
01:15:24,00 --> 01:15:29,50
Sitting beside her great-aunt, she stares ahead coldly. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS779
01:15:28,00 --> 01:15:33,50
Mama watches her remove her sunglasses. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS780
01:15:33,00 --> 01:15:40,50
The older woman turns to face SOMEONE who keeps his gaze fixed forward. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS781
01:15:37,00 --> 01:15:44,50
A tear streams down Mama's cheek and she shakily suppresses a sob. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS782
01:15:42,00 --> 01:15:46,50
SOMEONE's gaze softens. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS783
01:15:44,00 --> 01:15:51,50
As she lays her head on the old woman's shoulder, Mama nuzzles against her and closes her eyes. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS784
01:15:49,00 --> 01:15:53,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS785
01:15:51,00 --> 01:15:55,50
Later, he drives Mama. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS786
01:16:00,00 --> 01:16:04,50
Pepe rides with them. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS787
01:16:04,00 --> 01:16:09,50
SOMEONE parks at a curb and gets out. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS788
01:16:07,00 --> 01:16:15,50
Nearby, a car's side mirror reflects a man smoking a cigar as he watches SOMEONE's uncle through sunglasses. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS789
01:16:13,00 --> 01:16:19,50
Sitting in another parked car, SOMEONE chews gum. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS790
01:16:17,00 --> 01:16:25,50
At the Third Precinct, Shari approaches her desk and finds a female FBI agent working at her computer. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS792
01:16:37,00 --> 01:16:42,50
At the FBI office, he compares SOMEONE's hands in two photos. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS793
01:16:41,00 --> 01:16:47,50
He gets a 100% match on her nose. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS794
01:16:57,00 --> 01:17:03,50
Agent SOMEONE and his powerfully built colleague briskly march away. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS795
01:17:01,00 --> 01:17:07,50
Now a low sun casts a golden glow in the sky over Chicago. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS796
01:17:05,00 --> 01:17:10,50
In her apartment, SOMEONE soaks forlornly in a tub. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS797
01:17:08,00 --> 01:17:14,50
One arm dangles over the side holding a lit cigarette. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS798
01:17:13,00 --> 01:17:17,50
She drops it in a glass of water. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS799
01:17:15,00 --> 01:17:21,50
At his apartment, SOMEONE brings up his photo of SOMEONE on his phone. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS800
01:17:19,00 --> 01:17:23,50
He smiles fondly. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS801
01:17:23,00 --> 01:17:28,50
His display reads, "Unknown number." 

COLOMBIANA_DVS802
01:17:30,00 --> 01:17:34,50
The FBI listens in. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS803
01:17:56,00 --> 01:18:00,50
He knocks on a wall. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS804
01:17:59,00 --> 01:18:04,50
They're in a van followed by a police car. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS807
01:18:23,00 --> 01:18:28,50
One of her monitors reads, "Third party on line." 

COLOMBIANA_DVS808
01:18:28,00 --> 01:18:35,50
A surveillance feed shows the SWAT truck arriving outside. The team storms the building. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS809
01:18:39,00 --> 01:18:44,50
She drops her cell and rummages through a drawer. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS810
01:18:42,00 --> 01:18:47,50
Outside, SOMEONE puts on a bulletproof vest. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS811
01:18:44,00 --> 01:18:51,50
SOMEONE finds a key then takes a handgun from a table's underside. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS812
01:18:48,00 --> 01:18:53,50
Rushing through the apartment, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS813
01:18:50,00 --> 01:18:55,50
she turns on the shower then opens the birdcage. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS814
01:18:53,00 --> 01:18:58,50
She peeks out her apartment door into the hall. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS816
01:19:00,00 --> 01:19:06,50
In the lobby, SOMEONE takes an elevator. SWAT officers climb a stairwell. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS817
01:19:07,00 --> 01:19:12,50
SOMEONE runs barefoot down the hall, gun in hand. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS818
01:19:10,00 --> 01:19:17,50
As the elevator approaches the 11th floor, Agent SOMEONE draws his gun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS819
01:19:14,00 --> 01:19:21,50
SOMEONE reaches a stairwell and descends just as the elevator arrives. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS820
01:19:18,00 --> 01:19:24,50
Two SWAT officers cautiously scope out the area. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS821
01:19:21,00 --> 01:19:27,50
In the stairwell, SOMEONE pauses briefly, looking down. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS822
01:19:25,00 --> 01:19:31,50
Meanwhile, the SWAT team accompanying SOMEONE reaches her apartment door. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS823
01:19:31,00 --> 01:19:37,50
Agent SOMEONE arrives in another corridor with more gunmen. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS824
01:19:34,00 --> 01:19:42,50
From the stairwell, SOMEONE evades the ascending SWAT team by ducking into a hallway. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS825
01:19:39,00 --> 01:19:47,50
She races to a door, unlocks it, and slips into a living room where a long haired man watches TV. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS826
01:19:45,00 --> 01:19:49,50
He bolts up as she enters. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS827
01:19:47,00 --> 01:19:53,50
She slams his head against a coffee table, knocking him out. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS828
01:19:50,00 --> 01:19:55,50
Her gun ready, she proceeds to a bathroom, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS829
01:19:53,00 --> 01:19:58,50
climbs up on the rim of the tub and lifts a ceiling tile. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS830
01:19:57,00 --> 01:20:01,50
In a hallway. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS831
01:20:03,00 --> 01:20:10,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE takes a huge assault rifle down from the crawl space. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS832
01:20:07,00 --> 01:20:16,50
On the 11th floor, a SWAT officer slips a snake camera under a door while Agent SOMEONE watches its video monitor. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS833
01:20:13,00 --> 01:20:18,50
He finds SOMEONE's living room empty. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS834
01:20:18,00 --> 01:20:24,50
A SWAT officer fixes explosives to the door. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS835
01:20:21,00 --> 01:20:27,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE collects a hidden arsenal of weapons, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS836
01:20:24,00 --> 01:20:30,50
attaching the smaller ones to a belt around her waist. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS837
01:20:27,00 --> 01:20:33,50
She sets a charge on the tiled wall and pushes a button. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS838
01:20:31,00 --> 01:20:37,50
Taking up her enormous rifle, she marches down her neighbor's hallway. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS839
01:20:35,00 --> 01:20:40,50
She pauses by the door and raises a detonator. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS840
01:20:40,00 --> 01:20:50,50
At Agent SOMEONE's command, the apartment door explodes. A fire ball blossoms out from the unit and rolls down the hall. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS841
01:20:47,00 --> 01:20:52,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE punches her detonator. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS842
01:20:50,00 --> 01:20:55,50
A fiery blast rips a hole in the bathroom wall. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS843
01:20:53,00 --> 01:21:00,50
Agent SOMEONE stands calmly in an elevator that jostles with the force of the explosion. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS844
01:20:57,00 --> 01:21:03,50
In the neighbor's apartment, the flames quickly fill the bathroom 

COLOMBIANA_DVS845
01:21:00,00 --> 01:21:06,50
then lap into the hall where SOMEONE takes cover. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS846
01:21:03,00 --> 01:21:08,50
Both fires die down. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS847
01:21:05,00 --> 01:21:12,50
The SWAT team enters her apartment while she approaches the fresh hole in the wall. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS848
01:21:09,00 --> 01:21:14,50
Agent SOMEONE waves smoke out of his face. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS849
01:21:18,00 --> 01:21:26,50
In the bathroom, SOMEONE uses a cable to lower her rifle down a now exposed shaft. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS850
01:21:23,00 --> 01:21:27,50
In her apartment, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS851
01:21:24,00 --> 01:21:30,50
Agent SOMEONE notices the empty birdcage then the orchid painting. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS852
01:21:28,00 --> 01:21:35,50
SOMEONE slides down a cluster of pipes in the shaft, passing several stories. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS853
01:21:32,00 --> 01:21:37,50
She lands gracefully at ground level. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS854
01:21:35,00 --> 01:21:41,50
In her apartment, Agent SOMEONE peers at her surveillance monitor. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS855
01:21:38,00 --> 01:21:44,50
Now a vent cover flies loose and a bare foot steps out. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS856
01:21:42,00 --> 01:21:46,50
SOMEONE crawls out from the shaft. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS857
01:21:44,00 --> 01:21:49,50
In an elevator, Agent SOMEONE speaks into his radio. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS858
01:21:49,00 --> 01:21:54,50
SOMEONE eyes monitors in the lobby. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS859
01:21:51,00 --> 01:21:56,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE shoots out a camera. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS861
01:22:02,00 --> 01:22:09,50
Now sweat glistens on SOMEONE's skin as she pads briskly through the garage. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS862
01:22:07,00 --> 01:22:15,50
Arriving at another vent cover, she sets her rifle aside and unscrews the grating with her finger. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS863
01:22:12,00 --> 01:22:18,50
She turns as the authorities march into the garage, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS864
01:22:15,00 --> 01:22:21,50
then lifts the grate and feeds her rifle inside. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS865
01:22:18,00 --> 01:22:27,50
SWAT officers sweep the space with rifle lights. SOMEONE climbs backward through the narrow vent hole. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS866
01:22:24,00 --> 01:22:30,50
She contorts, struggling to fit her long limbs inside. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS867
01:22:29,00 --> 01:22:36,50
Her foot retracts from view just as the SWAT team rounds the corner. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS868
01:22:33,00 --> 01:22:40,50
Agents Ross and SOMEONE arrive and march through the damp garage. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS869
01:22:40,00 --> 01:22:45,50
SOMEONE tiptoes through a vent system. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS870
01:22:50,00 --> 01:22:56,50
As they search, SOMEONE pads through a shadowy tunnel. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS871
01:22:57,00 --> 01:23:04,50
A SWAT Humvee arrives in the garage with its lights flashing, trailed by two police cruisers. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS872
01:23:02,00 --> 01:23:07,50
Agent SOMEONE turns to face them. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS873
01:23:04,00 --> 01:23:11,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE arrives in a changing room and checks a set of lockers. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS874
01:23:08,00 --> 01:23:13,50
She finds one unlocked and opens it. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS875
01:23:11,00 --> 01:23:19,50
Now as a subway train moves through the tunnel, a uniform clad SOMEONE slips out onto a catwalk above it. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS876
01:23:17,00 --> 01:23:22,50
A worker mends a track below as she creeps along, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS877
01:23:19,00 --> 01:23:24,50
her rifle bundled in a large sack. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS878
01:23:22,00 --> 01:23:27,50
She strides up a walkway toward daylight. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS879
01:23:24,00 --> 01:23:29,50
Later, she arrives at SOMEONE's house. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS880
01:23:31,00 --> 01:23:37,50
She halts at the sight of an unfinished cigar on a side table. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS881
01:23:34,00 --> 01:23:40,50
Drawing a handgun, she proceeds through the foyer. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS882
01:23:37,00 --> 01:23:41,50
She heads upstairs. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS883
01:23:39,00 --> 01:23:47,50
Nearing the top, she finds Pepe's shattered sunglasses lying on the second floor, inches from his limp hand. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS884
01:23:47,00 --> 01:23:52,50
She aims her gun upward then ventures on. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS885
01:23:50,00 --> 01:23:55,50
Reaching the kitchen, she bursts into tears. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS886
01:23:57,00 --> 01:24:04,50
She kneels down to the old woman's crumpled body beside the overturned table and chair. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS887
01:24:09,00 --> 01:24:13,50
SOMEONE scrambles to her feet, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS888
01:24:10,00 --> 01:24:15,50
raises her gun and rushes through the house. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS889
01:24:13,00 --> 01:24:19,50
Reaching a doorway, she stops and slumps against the frame. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS890
01:24:16,00 --> 01:24:22,50
Her arms sink to her sides as she stares ahead. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS891
01:24:20,00 --> 01:24:25,50
She shuffles through a living room to a sitting room. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS893
01:24:23,00 --> 01:24:30,50
In front of her, a bloody SOMEONE sits tied to a chair, his head drooped forward. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS894
01:24:28,00 --> 01:24:32,50
The gun drops from her hand. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS896
01:24:33,00 --> 01:24:39,50
She moves closer, She sinks down before her murdered uncle, and sobs against his shoulder. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS897
01:24:50,00 --> 01:24:54,50
She buries her face in his lap. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS898
01:24:52,00 --> 01:24:59,50
In the FBI office, Agent SOMEONE thoughtfully stares at a SOMEONE orchid 

COLOMBIANA_DVS899
01:24:56,00 --> 01:25:00,50
as he turns it in his fingers. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS900
01:24:58,00 --> 01:25:01,50
Now he leaves. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS901
01:24:59,00 --> 01:25:03,50
At a store, he buys a frozen dinner. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS902
01:25:03,00 --> 01:25:08,50
Later, he passes a neighbor walking his dog. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS903
01:25:06,00 --> 01:25:13,50
The agent heads through an iron security gate and approaches the entrance of a brownstone building. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS904
01:25:11,00 --> 01:25:16,50
Now he arrives in a modest apartment. He sets his gun and badge in a drawer. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS905
01:25:13,00 --> 01:25:22,50
He wearily takes his frozen dinner to the kitchen and puts it tray in the microwave. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS906
01:25:23,00 --> 01:25:31,50
Turning, he finds SOMEONE standing nearby in the shadows with her handgun pointed at him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS907
01:25:44,00 --> 01:25:49,50
He sits as she shows the disconnected cameras. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS908
01:25:57,00 --> 01:26:02,50
With a sad smile, she lowers her gun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS909
01:26:00,00 --> 01:26:06,50
Agent SOMEONE looks down. A wired timer blinks under his seat. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS910
01:26:23,00 --> 01:26:26,50
SOMEONE nods. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS911
01:26:25,00 --> 01:26:31,50
She pulls out a newspaper clipping and tearfully holds it out. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS912
01:26:28,00 --> 01:26:33,50
It includes a photo of SOMEONE. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS913
01:27:00,00 --> 01:27:05,50
She shakes her head with a sorrowful childlike pout 

COLOMBIANA_DVS914
01:27:03,00 --> 01:27:07,50
then shows a photo on a cellphone. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS915
01:27:31,00 --> 01:27:37,50
She takes a framed photo from a shelf and stares down at it. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS916
01:27:42,00 --> 01:27:46,50
She puts the photo back. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS917
01:27:43,00 --> 01:27:49,50
It shows Agent SOMEONE with his wife and two young children. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS918
01:28:04,00 --> 01:28:08,50
She turns away. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS919
01:28:07,00 --> 01:28:12,50
She halts in the kitchen, her weary gaze cast downward. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS920
01:28:19,00 --> 01:28:24,50
She starts the microwave then leaves. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS921
01:28:22,00 --> 01:28:27,50
Agent SOMEONE glances at his chair. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS922
01:28:24,00 --> 01:28:29,50
The microwave timer ticks down to zero. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS923
01:28:27,00 --> 01:28:32,50
Agent SOMEONE stands up quickly, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS924
01:28:29,00 --> 01:28:34,50
spins around, and leans his hands on the seat. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS925
01:28:34,00 --> 01:28:38,50
He springs back safely. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS927
01:28:50,00 --> 01:28:54,50
At the CIA, he throws down a file. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS928
01:29:25,00 --> 01:29:31,50
He gives the FBI agent a cold smirk. SOMEONE turns away. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS929
01:29:29,00 --> 01:29:35,50
SOMEONE smiles behind his back as he answers his cell. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS930
01:29:33,00 --> 01:29:41,50
Listening to the caller, he looks out the windows as he makes his way back to SOMEONE's desk. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS931
01:29:48,00 --> 01:29:55,50
A red laser point appears on SOMEONE's chest. He responds with a sneer. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS932
01:29:58,00 --> 01:30:04,50
SOMEONE backs away and ducks close to a wall by the window. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS933
01:30:02,00 --> 01:30:08,50
He peeks out and finds SOMEONE crouched behind a rifle on a neighboring balcony. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS934
01:30:06,00 --> 01:30:13,50
A bullet pierces the glass and hits a photo of SOMEONE with President SOMEONE W. Bush. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS935
01:30:32,00 --> 01:30:37,50
SOMEONE stares at his phone. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS936
01:30:34,00 --> 01:30:42,50
He peers cautiously out the window then returns to the desk, takes his file, and goes. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS937
01:30:39,00 --> 01:30:44,50
SOMEONE sits stiffly, his mouth agape. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS938
01:30:43,00 --> 01:30:50,50
Now beneath a hazy sky, we soar over Chicago's skyscrapers. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS939
01:30:47,00 --> 01:30:54,50
SOMEONE arrives in Pepe's garage and slides a pair of chain link doors open. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS940
01:30:52,00 --> 01:30:57,50
She removes a locker's padlock, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS941
01:30:54,00 --> 01:31:00,50
takes out a selection of rifles, and sets them on a worktable. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS942
01:30:57,00 --> 01:31:03,50
The assassin loads a clip into an assault rifle 

COLOMBIANA_DVS943
01:31:00,00 --> 01:31:05,50
then shuts a weapons case. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS944
01:31:02,00 --> 01:31:08,50
As she loads an armored truck, she notices the dogs watching her. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS945
01:31:08,00 --> 01:31:14,50
SOMEONE shifts her gaze then looks back at the dogs. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS946
01:31:12,00 --> 01:31:18,50
Now the truck's headlights switch on and the vehicle pulls out of its spot. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS947
01:31:15,00 --> 01:31:22,50
With SOMEONE at the wheel, it smashes through a gate and out onto the street. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS948
01:31:19,00 --> 01:31:27,50
At twilight, the truck splashes through puddles as it progresses down a narrow uneven alley. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS949
01:31:25,00 --> 01:31:34,50
Now as we peer down a hallway's polished floor, we find a portly bespectacled man marching toward us, a briefcase in hand. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS950
01:31:32,00 --> 01:31:37,50
He arrives at a door and passes through. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS951
01:31:34,00 --> 01:31:41,50
Its stenciled lettering reads, "Stanley J. SOMEONE, Chief Land Surveyor." 

COLOMBIANA_DVS952
01:31:40,00 --> 01:31:45,50
SOMEONE sits in his chair. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS953
01:31:57,00 --> 01:32:01,50
She aims a gun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS954
01:31:59,00 --> 01:32:03,50
Now at the mansion. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS955
01:32:21,00 --> 01:32:28,50
SOMEONE shifts his gaze to an open door straight away and sees a rocket flying right at him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS956
01:32:27,00 --> 01:32:34,50
He lunges sideways avoiding the projectile which explodes as it hits a wall. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS957
01:32:32,00 --> 01:32:37,50
A burst of roiling flames fills the room 

COLOMBIANA_DVS958
01:32:34,00 --> 01:32:39,50
then blasts out doors and windows. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS959
01:32:36,00 --> 01:32:42,50
A crystal chandelier crashes to the ground. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS960
01:32:39,00 --> 01:32:44,50
As the flames give way to a haze of smoke, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS961
01:32:41,00 --> 01:32:46,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE's gunmen writhe. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS962
01:32:46,00 --> 01:32:53,50
Looking into the adjacent room, SOMEONE finds his boss unconscious on the floor. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS963
01:32:50,00 --> 01:32:55,50
He hurries over and starts to lift him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS964
01:32:55,00 --> 01:32:59,50
The man stirs. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS965
01:32:59,00 --> 01:33:02,50
He stands. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS966
01:33:05,00 --> 01:33:12,50
With their weapons raised, four gunmen rush into a spacious garage. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS967
01:33:10,00 --> 01:33:16,50
Scurrying to a row of luxury cars, they climb into a Mercedes. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS968
01:33:14,00 --> 01:33:24,50
As it speeds toward the garage's exit, the armored truck backs through a wall beside it and smashes into the vehicle's nose. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS969
01:33:23,00 --> 01:33:30,50
It continues to reverse, driving over the Mercedes's hood and crushing it. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS970
01:33:27,00 --> 01:33:33,50
SOMEONE climbs out with a sub machine gun raised. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS971
01:33:31,00 --> 01:33:35,50
She fires at the car. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS973
01:33:34,00 --> 01:33:42,50
As the barrage of bullets kills the men inside, smoking casings pop out of her gun and shower the ground. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS974
01:33:41,00 --> 01:33:46,50
SOMEONE leads his boss away. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS975
01:33:47,00 --> 01:33:52,50
They turn down a corridor. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS976
01:33:49,00 --> 01:33:54,50
He pushes a statue on the wall. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS977
01:33:54,00 --> 01:34:00,50
A panel behind the statue pushes inward to reveal a hidden compartment. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS978
01:33:58,00 --> 01:34:03,50
SOMEONE closes himself inside. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS979
01:34:00,00 --> 01:34:06,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE creeps through a crawl space under the mansion. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS980
01:34:04,00 --> 01:34:09,50
Dust sprinkles down through the floorboards above. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS981
01:34:11,00 --> 01:34:17,50
Pressing her back to a wall, she fires up through the floorboards. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS982
01:34:16,00 --> 01:34:21,50
As her shots hit a gunman, others take cover. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS983
01:34:18,00 --> 01:34:24,50
The shooting ceases and the bullet riddled man falls. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS984
01:34:21,00 --> 01:34:26,50
SOMEONE peers out from another room. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS985
01:34:24,00 --> 01:34:30,50
A beefy gunman shows him a grenade and the bearded gangster nods. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS986
01:34:28,00 --> 01:34:34,50
The gunman tosses it over and SOMEONE pulls its pin. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS987
01:34:32,00 --> 01:34:38,50
He lobs it into the other room where it lands beside the murdered gunman. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS989
01:34:37,00 --> 01:34:44,50
The explosion tears into the floor and churning fire surges through the crawl space. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS990
01:34:41,00 --> 01:34:48,50
SOMEONE watches from a safe distance as smoldering SOMEONE rains down. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS991
01:34:46,00 --> 01:34:52,50
In the hidden compartment, SOMEONE presses his ear to the panel 

COLOMBIANA_DVS992
01:34:49,00 --> 01:34:54,50
then takes out his cell and dials. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS993
01:34:51,00 --> 01:34:55,50
SOMEONE answers. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS994
01:34:57,00 --> 01:35:04,50
Stepping into the destroyed room, the beefy gunman fires down the hole in the floor 

COLOMBIANA_DVS995
01:35:02,00 --> 01:35:07,50
then jumps into the crawl space, his weapon still blasting. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS996
01:35:05,00 --> 01:35:09,50
More gunmen follow. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS997
01:35:06,00 --> 01:35:14,50
With the phone still to his ear, SOMEONE aims a handgun as he cautiously steps toward the hole. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS998
01:35:15,00 --> 01:35:20,50
SOMEONE gives a relieved look. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS999
01:35:17,00 --> 01:35:23,50
A burst of bullets hits the gunmen in the crawl space. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1000
01:35:23,00 --> 01:35:29,50
Hiding behind a pillar, SOMEONE lowers his phone. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1001
01:35:26,00 --> 01:35:34,50
On the opposite side of the room, SOMEONE stands on a mezzanine with a sub machine gun in each hand. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1002
01:35:31,00 --> 01:35:38,50
SOMEONE squeezes his eyes closed as her bullets hit the floor near his feet. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1003
01:35:35,00 --> 01:35:45,50
Her shots rip side by side paths of holes in the wood then lift to three gunmen in the adjacent room, killing one after another. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1004
01:35:45,00 --> 01:35:52,50
SOMEONE turns to the mezzanine and fires. SOMEONE races away. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1005
01:35:50,00 --> 01:35:57,50
As a thin gunman and a bald one shoot up at the mezzanine, SOMEONE rushes out of the room. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1006
01:35:54,00 --> 01:36:01,50
The bald gunman follows and the thin one takes cover behind a pillar. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1007
01:35:58,00 --> 01:36:05,50
Now alone, the thin gunman peers around his pillar at the mezzanine. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1008
01:36:05,00 --> 01:36:11,50
SOMEONE stands beside him holding a gun to his cheek. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1009
01:36:08,00 --> 01:36:14,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE listens on his phone. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1010
01:36:12,00 --> 01:36:19,50
Now SOMEONE steps over the thin gunman's dead body and strides off. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1011
01:36:16,00 --> 01:36:23,50
Elsewhere in the mansion, SOMEONE and the bald gunman hurry into a bedroom. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1012
01:36:20,00 --> 01:36:25,50
As the gunman shuts the door and waits, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1013
01:36:22,00 --> 01:36:26,50
his weapon raised, SOMEONE closes himself into a bathroom. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1015
01:36:25,00 --> 01:36:30,50
SOMEONE talks into his cell. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1016
01:36:32,00 --> 01:36:37,50
The bearded gangster hangs up. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1017
01:36:34,00 --> 01:36:42,50
In the bedroom, the gunman grits his teeth as he stares at the door paned with textured glass. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1019
01:36:40,00 --> 01:36:47,50
SOMEONE sets his phone on a shelf by a tub and glances at the closed door. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1020
01:36:45,00 --> 01:36:51,50
He checks the chamber in his pistol then tosses the weapon on the floor. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1021
01:36:48,00 --> 01:36:54,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE slumps against a wall in the compartment. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1022
01:36:52,00 --> 01:36:59,50
Setting his tinted glasses on the shelf, SOMEONE watches the bathroom door open. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1023
01:36:56,00 --> 01:37:01,50
SOMEONE enters with her gun raised. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1024
01:37:06,00 --> 01:37:13,50
As she kicks his pistol away, he grabs her wrist and redirects her aim. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1025
01:37:10,00 --> 01:37:17,50
She releases the weapon, catches it in her other hand, and points at him again. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1026
01:37:14,00 --> 01:37:21,50
He grabs its barrel and strikes her in the head, snatching it away as she stumbles. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1027
01:37:18,00 --> 01:37:25,50
He raises it and she grabs a glass off a shelf and hurls it at him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1028
01:37:22,00 --> 01:37:32,50
She wraps a towel around his gun wielding wrist and pulls down as if operating a lever, using her own shoulder as a fulcrum to break his arm. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1029
01:37:30,00 --> 01:37:36,50
Yanking her ponytail back, SOMEONE wiggles out of her hold. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1030
01:37:33,00 --> 01:37:39,50
She whips the towel at his hand and knocks the gun into the tub. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1031
01:37:36,00 --> 01:37:41,50
As she whips at him, he dodges 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1032
01:37:38,00 --> 01:37:43,50
then grabs the towel's other end. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1033
01:37:40,00 --> 01:37:46,50
She spins toward him, punches him in the throat, then kicks him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1034
01:37:43,00 --> 01:37:47,50
Holding him against a wall, she strikes him over and over. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1036
01:37:46,00 --> 01:37:54,50
He shoves her away but she wraps the towel around his neck and starts to choke him from behind. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1037
01:37:51,00 --> 01:37:58,50
He backs her into a wall, breaks the hold, and hurls her aside. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1038
01:37:55,00 --> 01:38:02,50
As he grabs the gun from the tub, she knocks it to the floor. She kicks him in the groin. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1039
01:38:00,00 --> 01:38:12,50
Standing behind her, he wraps the towel around her neck and starts to choke her. Removing her belt, she flips it over her head, wraps it around the back of his neck, and faces him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1040
01:38:09,00 --> 01:38:15,50
She swings him into a fireplace and they both tumble to the ground. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1041
01:38:14,00 --> 01:38:24,50
Pushing himself to his feet, SOMEONE moves to SOMEONE and pulls her hair. She grabs a toothbrush on the ground and stabs him with it. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1042
01:38:21,00 --> 01:38:27,50
As she picks up another, he yanks her to her feet. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1043
01:38:24,00 --> 01:38:29,50
She swipes at him with a brush in each hand. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1044
01:38:27,00 --> 01:38:34,50
He grabs her wrists, holding her back, but she twists free and slashes at him. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1045
01:38:31,00 --> 01:38:36,50
Spinning, she backhands him with one of the brushes. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1046
01:38:34,00 --> 01:38:37,50
He charges, grabbing her around the waist. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1048
01:38:36,00 --> 01:38:43,50
As she gets thrown against the wall, the brushes fall from her grasp. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1049
01:38:40,00 --> 01:38:48,50
She lands a punch, sending SOMEONE crumpling to the floor where he grabs the abandoned gun. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1050
01:38:45,00 --> 01:38:56,50
As he points it at SOMEONE, she quickly releases the weapon's magazine from its hand grip then yanks the slide from the barrel and stabs him in the neck with it. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1051
01:38:53,00 --> 01:38:57,50
His head droops. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1052
01:38:55,00 --> 01:39:01,50
SOMEONE withdraws her hand, trembling as she falls back in exhaustion. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1053
01:38:59,00 --> 01:39:03,50
She stares at the dead gangster. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1054
01:39:01,00 --> 01:39:05,50
The clip juts grotesquely from his neck. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1056
01:39:03,00 --> 01:39:09,50
A bloody nosed SOMEONE scoots back from him, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1057
01:39:06,00 --> 01:39:11,50
her body quivering with emotional sobs. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1058
01:39:09,00 --> 01:39:16,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE shifts his panicked eyes, then opens the compartment's panel. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1059
01:39:16,00 --> 01:39:22,50
Back in the bathroom, SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE's phone. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1060
01:39:19,00 --> 01:39:25,50
SOMEONE races to the garage and gets into a van. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1061
01:39:26,00 --> 01:39:32,50
Spinning its wheel, he steers past the destroyed Mercedes 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1062
01:39:29,00 --> 01:39:36,50
and squeezes between the armored truck and a wall, side swiping both on his way through. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1063
01:39:34,00 --> 01:39:39,50
He speeds out a door and onto a narrow road. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1064
01:39:37,00 --> 01:39:46,50
With a frantic look, he pulls onto the main road leading out of his estate, passes through the front gate and swerves onto a street. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1065
01:39:44,00 --> 01:39:50,50
The van fishtails, its spinning tires leaving a wake of churning dust. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1066
01:39:48,00 --> 01:39:53,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE exits the mansion. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1067
01:39:50,00 --> 01:39:57,50
Turning a corner, SOMEONE finds the road blocked by a garbage truck. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1068
01:40:03,00 --> 01:40:07,50
He answers a phone on the van's dash. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1069
01:40:42,00 --> 01:40:48,50
Turning, SOMEONE sees her dogs in the back seat. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1070
01:40:49,00 --> 01:40:55,50
The dogs attack and blood splatters the phone. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1071
01:40:52,00 --> 01:40:57,50
A view from outside shows the van shaking. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1072
01:40:55,00 --> 01:41:03,50
Blinking her weary eyes, SOMEONE lowers her cell from her ear and sucks in an anguished breath. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1073
01:41:00,00 --> 01:41:05,50
A thin trickle of blood leads from one nostril 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1074
01:41:03,00 --> 01:41:07,50
to the tip of her chin. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1075
01:41:04,00 --> 01:41:12,50
Warm sunlight washes over her face as she drops to her knees in the grass under a towering tree. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1076
01:41:10,00 --> 01:41:14,50
She bows her head. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1077
01:41:12,00 --> 01:41:19,50
Back in Chicago, SOMEONE sits with Agent SOMEONE in an office at the FBI. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1078
01:41:42,00 --> 01:41:47,50
Agent SOMEONE heads to the door. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1079
01:41:46,00 --> 01:41:52,50
As he leaves, SOMEONE gives a perturbed look. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1080
01:41:50,00 --> 01:41:56,50
Checking his phone's display, he glances around then answers. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1082
01:42:45,00 --> 01:42:49,50
The agent hurries off. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1083
01:42:50,00 --> 01:42:56,50
SOMEONE tears up. Agent SOMEONE enters the office. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1084
01:42:55,00 --> 01:42:59,50
He grabs the phone. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1085
01:42:59,00 --> 01:43:04,50
Depressing the payphone's hook, SOMEONE hangs up. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1086
01:43:01,00 --> 01:43:06,50
She allows a tiny smile. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1087
01:43:04,00 --> 01:43:10,50
At the FBI, Agent SOMEONE shoots his partner a frustrated look. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1088
01:43:08,00 --> 01:43:13,50
With the phone's receiver cradled against her neck, 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1089
01:43:10,00 --> 01:43:15,50
SOMEONE lets out a whisper. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1090
01:43:13,00 --> 01:43:18,50
She wipes away a tear then replaces the receiver. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1091
01:43:16,00 --> 01:43:21,50
At the FBI, Agent SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1092
01:43:20,00 --> 01:43:26,50
SOMEONE takes his cell back and heads out of the room. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1093
01:43:23,00 --> 01:43:28,50
As he leaves, Agent SOMEONE bows his head. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1094
01:43:26,00 --> 01:43:33,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE brushes a tear from her eye then slides on a pair of sunglasses. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1095
01:43:31,00 --> 01:43:39,50
Golden sunlight glows down on her as she turns away from the phone and dons a hat. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1096
01:43:36,00 --> 01:43:42,50
She strides toward a bus parked at the side of the road. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1097
01:43:49,00 --> 01:43:57,50
A woman sitting on a bench stares off with disinterested eyes as SOMEONE passes by then boards the bus. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1099
01:43:56,00 --> 01:44:02,50
Its door closes after her and the vehicle pulls into the road. 

COLOMBIANA_DVS1100
01:44:05,00 --> 01:44:11,50
The bus trails billows of exhaust as it trundles into the distance.
