GREEN_ZONE_DVS17
00:06:14,00 --> 00:06:19,50
SOMEONE leads four men down the alley 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS18
00:06:19,00 --> 00:06:26,50
The outside group charges past a donkey cart. In the warehouse, the others run away and take cover beside an exit. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS20
00:06:26,00 --> 00:06:34,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE peers up through an awning and sees a figure dash past an open-air window in the tower. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS21
00:06:37,00 --> 00:06:43,50
A solider peeks out from the warehouse. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS22
00:06:44,00 --> 00:06:50,50
SOMEONE fires a few bursts at the fifth floor of the tower then sees the sniper's head. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS24
00:06:59,00 --> 00:07:03,50
SOMEONE looks on. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS25
00:07:10,00 --> 00:07:14,50
The warehouse and cross over to the alley. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS26
00:07:14,00 --> 00:07:20,50
They race past looters dismantling light fixtures. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS27
00:07:21,00 --> 00:07:28,50
A soldier stands guard at a corner as his teammates enter an unlit building. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS29
00:07:29,00 --> 00:07:34,50
Another soldier uses a mirror on the top of a closed thick metal door. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS30
00:07:40,00 --> 00:07:46,50
The soldiers put on protective gloves and masks. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS32
00:07:53,00 --> 00:08:02,50
Beams of light lead the way into a pitch black chamber. We catch glimpses of a dusty floor and machinery. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS33
00:08:02,00 --> 00:08:09,50
The soldiers' flashlights glow from underneath the muzzles of their rifles. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS34
00:08:13,00 --> 00:08:18,50
And holds out a device pointed toward the floor. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS35
00:08:16,00 --> 00:08:23,50
Another soldier's light beam travels up the camouflage of a teammate's uniform. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS36
00:08:29,00 --> 00:08:43,50
SOMEONE removes his mask as two men open a pair of tall doors, letting sunlight flood into the room. The chief scans a rusted metal girder and other SOMEONE littering the floor. His men inspect the room. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS37
00:08:44,00 --> 00:08:49,50
SOMEONE eyes stains on the girder. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS38
00:08:52,00 --> 00:08:57,50
One guy checks out a stack of crates. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS39
00:09:06,00 --> 00:09:13,50
Now outside, a soldier smokes a cigarette as he lounges near a Humvee. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS40
00:09:13,00 --> 00:09:17,50
At the other side of the vehicle. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS41
00:09:15,00 --> 00:09:21,50
Mobile computer. SOMEONE returns. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS42
00:09:38,00 --> 00:09:43,50
He squints down at his intel report, 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS43
00:09:42,00 --> 00:09:47,50
folds it up, and heads off. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS44
00:09:52,00 --> 00:09:56,50
The soldiers load their equipment. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS45
00:09:58,00 --> 00:10:02,50
Choppers swoop down toward 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS46
00:10:02,00 --> 00:10:06,50
the International Airport. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS47
00:10:04,00 --> 00:10:08,50
In a white suit and sunglasses. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS48
00:10:28,00 --> 00:10:32,50
A petite blonde woman watches two cars approach. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS49
00:10:39,00 --> 00:10:43,50
He gets off the car. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS51
00:10:45,00 --> 00:10:49,50
An Arabic man exits a plane. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS52
00:11:45,00 --> 00:11:49,50
Mr. SOMEONE shakes hands. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS53
00:12:01,00 --> 00:12:05,50
Now the convoy arrives. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS54
00:12:22,00 --> 00:12:26,50
Techs work at computer stations on a 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS55
00:12:26,00 --> 00:12:30,50
screen filled with multiple satellites. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS56
00:12:37,00 --> 00:12:43,50
SOMEONE walks with a balding mustached officer. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS57
00:13:09,00 --> 00:13:14,50
Bethel leaves SOMEONE behind in a briefing room. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS58
00:13:15,00 --> 00:13:22,50
Into detention as an officer with salt and pepper hair enters. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS59
00:13:21,00 --> 00:13:25,50
As the personnel sit, SOMEONE scans the file. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS60
00:13:35,00 --> 00:13:40,50
A stout captain steps up. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS61
00:13:45,00 --> 00:13:49,50
A site named SOMEONE Monsieur. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS62
00:14:05,00 --> 00:14:11,50
SOMEONE frowns and raises his hand. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS63
00:14:30,00 --> 00:14:35,50
Bethel glowers disapprovingly. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS64
00:16:07,00 --> 00:16:11,50
He glances away. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS65
00:16:21,00 --> 00:16:26,50
SOMEONE stares earnestly at the soldier. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS67
00:16:52,00 --> 00:16:56,50
Sign reading Baghdad 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS68
00:16:55,00 --> 00:17:00,50
In big text. Now pedestrians in traffic crowd as 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS70
00:17:08,00 --> 00:17:12,50
Pots drops a bottle drop on him. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS72
00:17:16,00 --> 00:17:19,50
There's a parked car sitting blocking the road. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS74
00:18:34,00 --> 00:18:47,50
Now we soar over the city's crowded buildings to an area lush with vegetation. As we reach a palatial building, words appear - Coalition Provisional Authority 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS75
00:18:45,00 --> 00:18:55,50
Dom's Republican Palace. Inside, Clark addresses high ranking soldiers and officials in a video conference. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS76
00:19:27,00 --> 00:19:33,50
A staffer shifts her uncomfortable gaze from SOMEONE to Clark. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS77
00:20:59,00 --> 00:21:04,50
Clark coldly shuffles his paperwork. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS78
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:10,50
Now in a quiet residential neighborhood, an Iraqi man in a taupe suit patrols the sidewalk with an assault rifle. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS79
00:21:10,00 --> 00:21:51,50
Guard at an intersection. A fourth keeps lookout from a building's rooftop. A white SUV charges up the street then breaks by the man in the taupe suit. Nearby, a thin balding Iraqi with a mustache beneath his aquiline nose limps to a dusty grey car. Glancing across the street, he spots the guards escorting a cluster of well-dressed men away from the white SUV. The bystander gets in his dusty car, keeping an eye on the group as General SOMEONE leads them through a gate. Staring with parted lips, the bystander discreetly drives away. Inside a crowded living room, a middle-aged man lights a cigarette. SOMEONE enters the home and his host extends a hand. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS80
00:21:53,00 --> 00:21:59,50
They kiss cheeks and SOMEONE joins the other men in the living room. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS81
00:21:59,00 --> 00:22:08,50
They get to their feet. An older bald gentleman respectfully kisses SOMEONE's cheeks. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS82
00:22:08,00 --> 00:22:22,50
Another older man offers him the same greeting. SOMEONE accepts it then holds his hands up in a polite refusal to others as they edge toward him. The general sits and the others follow suit. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS91
00:23:08,00 --> 00:23:11,50
SOMEONE notices a crowd. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS92
00:23:20,00 --> 00:23:24,50
Villagers hold off the predominately male army. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS93
00:23:33,00 --> 00:23:38,50
A soldier pins the mustached man. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS94
00:23:40,00 --> 00:23:44,50
He attempts to help him stand. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS95
00:23:43,00 --> 00:23:47,50
He bats SOMEONE away. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS96
00:23:57,00 --> 00:24:03,50
As SOMEONE stares at him, he glances aside. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS97
00:24:50,00 --> 00:24:56,50
The chief maintains eye contact with the mustached local. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS98
00:24:57,00 --> 00:25:03,50
As SOMEONE stalks off, Wilkins catches up with him. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS99
00:25:03,00 --> 00:25:08,50
SOMEONE looks back at Conway. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS100
00:25:29,00 --> 00:25:34,50
SOMEONE faces him. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS102
00:26:12,00 --> 00:26:17,50
The boyish soldier nods. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS103
00:26:20,00 --> 00:26:26,50
Two assigned soldiers get into the dusty sedan. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS105
00:26:33,00 --> 00:26:36,50
Now at a safe house 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS107
00:27:01,00 --> 00:27:08,50
SOMEONE raises his hand, capturing the group's attention. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS115
00:27:49,00 --> 00:28:09,50
Sitting beside the general, SOMEONE lowers his gaze. The official glances to a comrade then nods. Now SOMEONE stands, prompting the others. He nods to the official's opponent who leaves. A man with a briefcase shakes the general's hand. Outside, the departing Baptists get into a sedan and drive off. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS116
00:28:09,00 --> 00:28:14,50
A car cruises down a street followed by the white truck. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS117
00:28:12,00 --> 00:28:23,50
The official shakes hands with SOMEONE, then outside, he chats with a comrade as they get into a car. SOMEONE's attachment approaches. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS118
00:28:27,00 --> 00:28:31,50
left. The pickup crosses to a dirty 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS119
00:28:34,00 --> 00:28:39,50
SOMEONE's sedan stops. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS120
00:28:40,00 --> 00:28:46,50
They peer across the now empty street. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS121
00:28:46,00 --> 00:28:52,50
They watch two men in suits head down the sidewalk. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS122
00:28:54,00 --> 00:28:58,50
The truck parks. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS123
00:28:57,00 --> 00:29:02,50
SOMEONE watches the men get in their car. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS125
00:29:30,00 --> 00:29:36,50
Three soldiers run to the outer wall.  

GREEN_ZONE_DVS127
00:29:51,00 --> 00:29:55,50
Soldiers signal and another kicks open door. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS128
00:29:55,00 --> 00:29:59,50
They storms indoors. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS130
00:30:10,00 --> 00:30:17,50
SOMEONE looks up a staircase. At the patio door, an aide gestures. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS131
00:30:19,00 --> 00:30:25,50
SOMEONE follows SOMEONE down a staircase.  

GREEN_ZONE_DVS132
00:30:23,00 --> 00:30:28,50
The chief peers across the lower window and sees SOMEONE's bald head. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS133
00:30:39,00 --> 00:30:47,50
They cross into a kitchen where the dead gunman lies on his back. They approach the open patio door. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS134
00:30:50,00 --> 00:30:58,50
Outside, they ascend a staircase to see an SUV drive away down the street. SOMEONE lowers his weapon. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS135
00:31:08,00 --> 00:31:18,50
The fallen Iraqi bleeds out on the floor.  

GREEN_ZONE_DVS136
00:31:42,00 --> 00:31:47,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE go upstairs to find SOMEONE with the women and children. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS138
00:31:55,00 --> 00:31:59,50
SOMEONE finds the little black notebook. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS139
00:32:06,00 --> 00:32:11,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS140
00:32:12,00 --> 00:32:16,50
SOMEONE grabs the notebook. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS141
00:33:30,00 --> 00:33:35,50
Now SOMEONE's car and the white pickup truck return. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS142
00:33:52,00 --> 00:33:56,50
SOMEONE to the wall. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS143
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:23,50
SOMEONE fidgets then looks at SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS144
00:34:57,00 --> 00:35:02,50
He takes out the black notebook. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS146
00:37:07,00 --> 00:37:11,50
SOMEONE hurries off at a limp. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS148
00:38:53,00 --> 00:38:57,50
He scans the pages. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS149
00:39:02,00 --> 00:39:06,50
He hops on one leg. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS150
00:39:09,00 --> 00:39:13,50
SOMEONE starts off. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS151
00:39:28,00 --> 00:39:39,50
He hops in place, turning away from them. SOMEONE glances at Pots, then walks over to the prosthetic leg, picks it up and hands it to SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS152
00:40:24,00 --> 00:40:33,50
SOMEONE holds his earnest gaze. Now our view orbits a massive bust of Saddam Hussein wearing a helmet. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS154
00:40:35,00 --> 00:40:43,50
Republican Palace. Inside, SOMEONE answers his phone while passing through a metal detector. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS155
00:41:02,00 --> 00:41:06,50
SOMEONE hangs up. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS156
00:41:28,00 --> 00:41:34,50
His stubble faced peer frowns. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS157
00:41:44,00 --> 00:41:48,50
They part company. SOMEONE gets in a Humvee. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS159
00:42:04,00 --> 00:42:12,50
skimming a file. SOMEONE approaches and walks with him down a staircase. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS161
00:42:46,00 --> 00:42:50,50
It shows a road leading to an archway. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS164
00:43:26,00 --> 00:43:30,50
He undoes his chinstrap and takes off his helmet and eyes the palace. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS165
00:43:34,00 --> 00:43:49,50
Now SOMEONE dons his sunglasses as he leads his men onto a patio surrounds a luxurious pool. Sunbathers lounge in deck chairs and waiters bustle. The soldier stare as two bikini clad women saunter by. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS166
00:43:52,00 --> 00:43:57,50
SOMEONE spots SOMEONE and a colleague at a table. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS167
00:44:02,00 --> 00:44:15,50
As SOMEONE makes his way around the pool, two guys in board shorts amble past, both casually toting semi-automatics. The soldier heads to SOMEONE's small patio table and takes a seat. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS168
00:44:33,00 --> 00:44:41,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE strolls around the patio. Back at the table, SOMEONE hands SOMEONE the little black book. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS169
00:44:48,00 --> 00:44:53,50
SOMEONE examines its contents. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS170
00:44:56,00 --> 00:45:02,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE then returns his attention to the book. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS171
00:45:03,00 --> 00:45:08,50
He lifts his gaze to the soldier's face. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS172
00:45:08,00 --> 00:45:14,50
SOMEONE tucks the book into his jacket pocket. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS173
00:45:20,00 --> 00:45:25,50
SOMEONE rises from the table and trods off. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS174
00:45:23,00 --> 00:45:28,50
As SOMEONE stands, SOMEONE weaves toward him. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS175
00:45:31,00 --> 00:45:36,50
She comes up behind him as he heads around the pool. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS176
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:05,50
SOMEONE gives a bashful smile. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS177
00:46:09,00 --> 00:46:14,50
He glances over his shoulder. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS178
00:46:18,00 --> 00:46:23,50
SOMEONE's smile fades. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS179
00:46:26,00 --> 00:46:32,50
She holds SOMEONE's gaze then reaches into her bag. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS180
00:46:34,00 --> 00:46:40,50
She hands him her contact info and he nods. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS181
00:46:38,00 --> 00:46:53,50
He strides off. Later, the chief faces a laptop and types, SOMEONE Dayne Wall Street Journal WMD into a Google search field. On a results page, the top link reads, Iraqi WMD program still active. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS182
00:46:51,00 --> 00:47:10,50
Scanning down the page, SOMEONE finds links to more of SOMEONE's articles. Sulochana Security Review, Iraqi chemical weapons programs, evidence of toxins at WMD sites, and IO agents and gas at an Iraqi university. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS183
00:47:10,00 --> 00:47:42,50
Focusing intently on the screen, SOMEONE reads an article entitled, News Source Confirms Iraq WMD Program. As his eyes scan the text, he takes note of specific phrases. A high ranking Iraqi official code named Magellan gave compelling information about Iraq's WMD program. Magellan identified specific site locations. The soldier blinks thoughtfully at the article's mention of botulin toxin at a facility at Diwaniya, an underground storage network at SOMEONE Monsieur. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS187
00:47:56,00 --> 00:48:03,50
while driving onto a compound, passes a departing military convoy. SOMEONE rides in the passenger seat. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS188
00:48:06,00 --> 00:48:12,50
SOMEONE rides in the passenger seat. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS190
00:49:09,00 --> 00:49:16,50
Now the white Jeep splashes through a puddle as it drives down a desolate road. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS191
00:49:14,00 --> 00:49:28,50
It pulls up in front of an abandoned mansion surrounded by rubble and SOMEONE climbs out of the passenger seat. In the mansion's debris-strewn foyer, he finds a dolphin statue and two soldiers. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS192
00:49:29,00 --> 00:49:41,50
SOMEONE jogs upstairs. In a neglected, once luxurious bedroom, SOMEONE slings a backpack over his shoulder, closes the laptop, and grabs his gun from the bed. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS193
00:50:37,00 --> 00:50:44,50
Standing beside a Humvee, they lock eyes. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS194
00:50:46,00 --> 00:50:51,50
SOMEONE studies him skeptically then glances away. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS195
00:50:51,00 --> 00:50:56,50
SOMEONE strolls off. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS196
00:50:55,00 --> 00:51:01,50
Later, SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk into a CIA compound. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS197
00:51:51,00 --> 00:51:56,50
SOMEONE sits in a cubicle. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS198
00:52:18,00 --> 00:52:22,50
SOMEONE blinks thoughtfully. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS199
00:52:21,00 --> 00:52:27,50
He shifts his gaze to SOMEONE and offers a firm nod. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS200
00:52:35,00 --> 00:52:39,50
SOMEONE hands him a folder. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS201
00:52:43,00 --> 00:52:46,50
He opens a safe. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS202
00:53:08,00 --> 00:53:13,50
SOMEONE gawks disbelievingly. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS203
00:53:15,00 --> 00:53:26,50
SOMEONE steadily holds his gaze. SOMEONE slings the money filled backpack over his shoulder and leaves. Outside, SOMEONE waits by his sedan. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS204
00:53:29,00 --> 00:53:34,50
As SOMEONE exits the building, the white Jeep 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS205
00:53:32,00 --> 00:53:36,50
and the SUV speed into 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS207
00:53:46,00 --> 00:53:52,50
He strides past SOMEONE then glances back at him. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS208
00:53:50,00 --> 00:54:01,50
SOMEONE shifts his confused gaze and heads to his Humvee. SOMEONE loiters nearby, his car now tagged with the letters US on its door. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS210
00:54:12,00 --> 00:54:16,50
A colleague makes a call. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS211
00:54:17,00 --> 00:54:27,50
As SOMEONE unfolds it and skims its contents, more pentagon agents filter into the control room. He lifts his eyes to SOMEONE's. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS212
00:54:30,00 --> 00:54:34,50
SOMEONE glares angrily. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS213
00:54:34,00 --> 00:54:39,50
SOMEONE smugly tilts his head. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS214
00:54:38,00 --> 00:54:45,50
A pentagon agent hurries over with the black book in hand and passes it to SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS215
00:54:45,00 --> 00:54:53,50
As SOMEONE and his agents leave, SOMEONE watches with narrowed eyes. SOMEONE heads into a lobby. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS216
00:54:55,00 --> 00:55:02,50
the special forces leader and hands him the black book. The soldier pockets it. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS223
00:55:56,00 --> 00:56:01,50
SOMEONE eyes them expressionlessly. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS224
00:56:02,00 --> 00:56:11,50
SOMEONE follows SOMEONE through a gate. A sign reads, Camp Cropper, Theater Internment Facility. In a front office, 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS225
00:56:11,00 --> 00:56:16,50
SOMEONE presents some paperwork. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS226
00:56:22,00 --> 00:56:27,50
opens his backpack and a guard approaches SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS227
00:56:27,00 --> 00:56:42,50
He pats the civilian down. Beside them, a guard seated at a desk watches a basketball game on TV. The soldier inspecting SOMEONE's backpack finds plastic wrapped stacks of bills inside. He shows the sergeant. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS228
00:56:44,00 --> 00:56:49,50
The guard inspects SOMEONE's belongings. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS229
00:56:50,00 --> 00:57:05,50
They head into a narrow hallway where doors with padlocked bolts line the walls every five feet. A man hangs his hands into the hall through a slot at the bottom of his door. He reaches out as SOMEONE passes. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS230
00:57:04,00 --> 00:57:08,50
The guide stops a few doors down. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS232
00:57:24,00 --> 00:57:30,50
He secures his leg irons to a ring in the floor. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS233
00:57:33,00 --> 00:57:42,50
The guard removes the man's hood and tosses it on the table then posts himself in the corner of the room. SOMEONE stares at him. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS234
00:57:46,00 --> 00:57:51,50
He exits. Facing the detainee, 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS235
00:57:49,00 --> 00:57:57,50
SOMEONE checks his watch. The prisoner's chest heaves, streaks of blood staining his cheek. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS236
00:57:59,00 --> 00:58:10,50
He glances uneasily at SOMEONE who waits with his hands on his hips. As the civilian averts his gaze and fidgets, the detainee eyes them nervously. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS237
00:58:11,00 --> 00:58:17,50
SOMEONE stoically checks his watch again. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS244
00:58:59,00 --> 00:59:03,50
They head down a corridor. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS245
00:59:02,00 --> 00:59:16,50
A guard opens a chain-linked gate for them and they turn a corner. As the strapping guard unlocks a cell, SOMEONE eyes two guards in a comfy caged in office.  

GREEN_ZONE_DVS246
00:59:20,00 --> 00:59:27,50
In the cell, SOMEONE lies prostrate on the floor, his back to the door. SOMEONE nudges him with his foot and SOMEONE's chest heaves. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS247
00:59:29,00 --> 00:59:35,50
The strapping guard hesitates. SOMEONE props up SOMEONE's head. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS248
00:59:37,00 --> 00:59:42,50
The battered SOMEONE murmurs. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS249
00:59:41,00 --> 00:59:47,50
Blood and bruises mar his face. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS250
00:59:53,00 --> 00:59:56,50
SOMEONE's body. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS251
00:59:56,00 --> 01:00:01,50
SOMEONE leans close and the prisoner winces. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS252
01:00:03,00 --> 01:00:07,50
SOMEONE enters. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS253
01:00:08,00 --> 01:00:12,50
SOMEONE stands and backs off. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS256
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:56,50
The mustached man and a cohort pull on ski masks and grab guns. Now in a safe house, three aides in business suits 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS257
01:00:53,00 --> 01:01:01,50
sit on a couch playing cards at a coffee table. A burly man with a trim goatee trudges in. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS258
01:01:03,00 --> 01:01:14,50
The burly man nods and ambles off. In a back room, a dignified man assembles a bomb at a well-lit desk. He twists two wires together. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS265
01:02:15,00 --> 01:02:31,50
shadowy corridor, he uses a flashlight. SOMEONE passes a room with an open door. Peeking inside, he finds a group of journalists working at computers. The soldier strides onward, brushing past two men in bulletproof vests. SOMEONE faces a door and knocks. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS266
01:02:30,00 --> 01:02:37,50
It swings open revealing a stunned SOMEONE on her cellphone. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS267
01:02:36,00 --> 01:02:42,50
She angles the receiver toward her mouth. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS268
01:02:40,00 --> 01:02:45,50
She hangs up and leads him in. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS269
01:02:43,00 --> 01:02:48,50
SOMEONE closes the door behind them. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS270
01:03:08,00 --> 01:03:15,50
SOMEONE nervously sweeps a wisp of hair out of her face. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS271
01:03:16,00 --> 01:03:21,50
She paces and rifles through some papers. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS272
01:03:24,00 --> 01:03:30,50
She summons a breath and drops her gaze. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS273
01:03:32,00 --> 01:03:38,50
The journalist shifts uneasily from foot to foot. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS274
01:03:42,00 --> 01:03:52,50
SOMEONE turns away and wanders to a wall papered with photos and notes then fearfully locks eyes with the soldier. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS275
01:03:58,00 --> 01:04:03,50
She wearily touches her forehead. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS276
01:04:01,00 --> 01:04:10,50
SOMEONE freezes. Facing SOMEONE earnestly, she starts to bite her lip then stifles the action. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS277
01:04:31,00 --> 01:04:38,50
The chief stares incredulously. SOMEONE whirls away. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS278
01:04:56,00 --> 01:05:03,50
SOMEONE paces again to the wall serving as her makeshift bulletin board and faces him. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS279
01:05:02,00 --> 01:05:14,50
SOMEONE stares with an arched brow then strides out. The journalist's sheepish gaze drifts after him. Now, SOMEONE storms through CIA offices. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS280
01:05:12,00 --> 01:05:18,50
He finds SOMEONE in a computer analysis room. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS281
01:05:20,00 --> 01:05:24,50
He slings down his backpack. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS282
01:05:27,00 --> 01:05:33,50
SOMEONE gapes then glances at a technician as he heads out. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS283
01:05:32,00 --> 01:05:37,50
SOMEONE follows. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS284
01:05:52,00 --> 01:05:59,50
The two men lock eyes. SOMEONE's gaze drifts and he marches into the control room. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS285
01:06:03,00 --> 01:06:07,50
He types at his computer. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS286
01:06:13,00 --> 01:06:18,50
SOMEONE stalks around a central desk. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS287
01:06:17,00 --> 01:06:22,50
He halts, facing the young soldier. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS288
01:06:29,00 --> 01:06:34,50
SOMEONE's lips stutter thoughtfully. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS289
01:06:34,00 --> 01:06:41,50
Another tech works at a computer. SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS290
01:06:57,00 --> 01:07:01,50
Now, SOMEONE's car speeds. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS291
01:07:21,00 --> 01:07:30,50
Two of SOMEONE's men descend a stairwell. At the bottom, the lean man opens a door and peeks outside into a motionless alley. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS292
01:07:29,00 --> 01:07:38,50
He and his stocky companion stride out. Nearby, the masked assassins prowl after them through the shadows. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS293
01:07:37,00 --> 01:07:45,50
SOMEONE's men near their car, the lean man toting a gun. The assassins hurry closer. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS294
01:07:58,00 --> 01:08:04,50
Where is he? He bashes the man against a wall. Tell me! 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS295
01:08:04,00 --> 01:08:08,50
knew, I would not tell you. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS296
01:08:11,00 --> 01:08:18,50
He gets shot. A Met-D soldier stalks into the alley behind him, his gun smoking. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS297
01:08:17,00 --> 01:08:20,50
He kicks the assassin's 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS298
01:08:18,00 --> 01:08:22,50
gun away. SOMEONE arrives. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS299
01:08:22,00 --> 01:08:30,50
SOMEONE faces the stocky man as the other soldier unmasks the dead assassin. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS300
01:08:39,00 --> 01:08:47,50
Now, agents and techs bustle around the CIA control room. A spiky haired tech speaks up. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS301
01:09:14,00 --> 01:09:19,50
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS302
01:09:29,00 --> 01:09:34,50
SOMEONE faces his team. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS303
01:09:39,00 --> 01:09:44,50
members disperse. SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS304
01:09:45,00 --> 01:09:54,50
The civilian stares imploringly. Seated in the Humvee, SOMEONE glances away and licks his lips. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS305
01:09:54,00 --> 01:10:02,50
SOMEONE shakes his head and backs away, summoning a quavering breath. He storms to his car. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS306
01:10:00,00 --> 01:10:05,50
The Humvee pulls out, followed by SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS308
01:10:14,00 --> 01:10:19,50
up and down the street, then jogs across it. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS309
01:10:19,00 --> 01:10:25,50
Now, in a safe house, he runs upstairs and knocks at a door. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS310
01:10:26,00 --> 01:10:34,50
An aide opens up and al-Malik enters. SOMEONE stares out a window inside. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS311
01:10:32,00 --> 01:10:37,50
He faces his commander. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS313
01:10:38,00 --> 01:10:42,50
The general blinks. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS317
01:10:59,00 --> 01:11:04,50
The bald general stares inscrutably. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS318
01:11:02,00 --> 01:11:14,50
Green zone, street lights glow around the domed palace. In a ballroom mess hall, a 20 foot American flag drapes a wall above hundreds of soldiers and civilians. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS319
01:11:19,00 --> 01:11:25,50
SOMEONE eyes a large screen showing President Bush. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS320
01:11:54,00 --> 01:11:58,50
He answers his satellite phone. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS321
01:12:08,00 --> 01:12:13,50
SOMEONE enters a control room. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS322
01:12:15,00 --> 01:12:20,50
In the mess hall, SOMEONE rises from the table. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS323
01:12:25,00 --> 01:12:38,50
SOMEONE whirls toward a screen. A bar highlights the words, Met-Delta on a list and a satellite map shows a moving icon. SOMEONE sneers and lifts his phone. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS324
01:12:40,00 --> 01:12:45,50
SOMEONE exits the palace. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS327
01:14:10,00 --> 01:14:15,50
In a control room, a grey haired tech answers a phone. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS328
01:14:15,00 --> 01:14:20,50
He hangs up and strides into SOMEONE's cubicle. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS330
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:45,50
Headlights flicker then turn off. Behind him, the Humvee cuts its headlights as well. The vehicles drive onward through the shadows then slow to a stop. SOMEONE and his squad climb out. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS331
01:14:49,00 --> 01:14:57,50
As an armed soldier mounts the roof of the Humvee, SOMEONE leads SOMEONE on foot to the mouth of the alley. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS332
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:12,50
He falls back behind the chief. Creeping along a wall, SOMEONE peeks out at compound across the street where several busses sit parked. The soldier studies them carefully then faces his men. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS333
01:15:15,00 --> 01:15:27,50
Leaving his men behind, SOMEONE strides out into the street and heads for the bus station. Scanning his desolate surroundings, he passes an abandoned hatchback. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS334
01:15:26,00 --> 01:15:46,50
Back at the alley, SOMEONE peeks around the corner and watches the chief pass a tall boxy bus. SOMEONE glances at it then arrives at the two-story cement ticketing kiosk. Graffiti covers its walls and bars protect its windows. The chief slows then wearily circles to the back of the building and halts. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS335
01:15:45,00 --> 01:15:52,50
A dog trots across a street and takes cover under a parked bus. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS336
01:15:52,00 --> 01:16:06,50
SOMEONE looks over his shoulder and spots one of his men stalking out the alley and across the street following his path. Clutching his weapon, the soldier ducks into a shadow and vanishes. SOMEONE strolls forward uneasily. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS337
01:16:09,00 --> 01:16:14,50
A man stands behind a bus. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS338
01:16:11,00 --> 01:16:17,50
The chief studies him quizzically then uses his radio. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS339
01:16:19,00 --> 01:16:27,50
Now, journalists crowd a press conference. As a camera flashes, a pentagon official struts in and takes his place. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS340
01:16:29,00 --> 01:17:03,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE hurries down a stairwell. At the bus station, SOMEONE prowls behind a row of parked buses. Halting, he gazes down a narrow passage between two of the hulking vehicles then treads through it. Nearby, three of his men take positions around other buses, all hold their weapons at the ready. SOMEONE reaches the end of a bus and peeks around it. Up ahead of it, SOMEONE 's envoy paces down a street then expectantly glances over his shoulder at SOMEONE. As the chief heads after him, the envoy turns a corner. SOMEONE radios in. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS341
01:17:06,00 --> 01:17:15,50
SOMEONE's men skulk onward and he pads down the alley, glances up at the bleak apartments looming above him. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS342
01:17:17,00 --> 01:17:23,50
SOMEONE sits among the assembled journalists. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS343
01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:43,50
SOMEONE watches smugly. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS344
01:17:53,00 --> 01:17:57,50
Now, SOMEONE watches on TV. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS346
01:18:28,00 --> 01:18:39,50
Now, SOMEONE emerges from an alley and spies SOMEONE's envoy yard ahead, maintaining a steady pace. SOMEONE follows, matching his gait. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS347
01:18:38,00 --> 01:18:45,50
He glances at an Iraqi woman in an upper window, then radios in. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS348
01:18:48,00 --> 01:19:14,50
Now, his four team members emerge from the alley and take up positions. Scant light and shadows crisscrossing the street play across SOMEONE's face as he advances. Ahead, SOMEONE's envoy breaks into a run and disappears around a corner. SOMEONE crosses another intersection, his gaze searching for a visual on the stranger. A block or so behind, one of his men scopes the street with a night vision lens. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS349
01:19:16,00 --> 01:19:21,50
SOMEONE radios his team. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS351
01:19:28,00 --> 01:19:32,50
and barricade him in. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS353
01:20:12,00 --> 01:20:19,50
SOMEONE grabs a pistol from under his sedan's backseat and hustles off. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS357
01:22:11,00 --> 01:22:19,50
Outside, the helicopters pass overhead. On the ground, SOMEONE peeks around a corner then hustles. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS358
01:22:30,00 --> 01:22:35,50
He jabs a pistol into SOMEONE's shoulder. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS359
01:22:55,00 --> 01:23:02,50
away from the landing zone. Back in the sitting room, SOMEONE leans close to SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS361
01:23:05,00 --> 01:23:12,50
SOMEONE enters the room as SOMEONE winces away from his tormentor. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS362
01:23:12,00 --> 01:23:25,50
Under the general's solemn care-worn gaze, the young militant straightens. As he stares at his imposing superior, SOMEONE nods him toward the door. SOMEONE shuffles out. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS363
01:23:25,00 --> 01:23:33,50
A gunman's rifle hovers at a relaxed angle by SOMEONE's face. The American looks to SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS364
01:23:47,00 --> 01:23:56,50
Outside, SOMEONE and his men advance down an alley. Elsewhere, the Iraqi in street clothes keeps running. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS365
01:23:55,00 --> 01:24:01,50
The night sky camouflages his shadowy form. Back with SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS366
01:24:32,00 --> 01:24:38,50
The two officers stare intently at each other. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS367
01:24:36,00 --> 01:24:42,50
SOMEONE steps closer, studying his captive. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS368
01:25:06,00 --> 01:25:17,50
Outside, in the Adaiah district, two of SOMEONE's armed followers guard the gated garage door. A green night vision view shows them clearly. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS369
01:25:17,00 --> 01:25:30,50
As a crouched sniper keeps a bead on the Iraqi men from 100 yards off, fellow soldiers creep across the street. The sniper is SOMEONE. He relaxes his aim and radios the Humvee convoy. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS370
01:26:23,00 --> 01:26:29,50
SOMEONE seizes SOMEONE by the collar. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS371
01:26:49,00 --> 01:27:02,50
SOMEONE's calm harsh gaze glares at SOMEONE who searches the general's eyes. The high ranking Iraqi lets go and nods to his gunman who rifle butts SOMEONE in the face. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS372
01:27:01,00 --> 01:27:07,50
Now, theIraqi in street clothes pounds on a metal door. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS373
01:27:09,00 --> 01:27:15,50
As the Special Forces infiltrate an alley, an SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS375
01:27:19,00 --> 01:27:27,50
kept positions near the rooftop water tower. On the ground, SOMEONE and his men stick to the shadows and post themselves. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS377
01:27:32,00 --> 01:27:37,50
The American reels on the floor holding his head. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS379
01:27:53,00 --> 01:27:57,50
They park, lights out. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS380
01:27:57,00 --> 01:28:04,50
SOMEONE keeps an eye on the garage door guards. The Humvee commander watches the water tower. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS381
01:28:05,00 --> 01:28:11,50
The Humvee lies in wait. Now, on the hideout's roof. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS383
01:28:47,00 --> 01:28:52,50
throws down a grenade. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS384
01:28:56,00 --> 01:29:01,50
The blast erupts outside, dust. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS387
01:29:11,00 --> 01:29:17,50
out of reach. Outside, SOMEONE and his team shoot at a side door. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS388
01:29:20,00 --> 01:29:23,50
then a grenade. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS390
01:29:26,00 --> 01:29:30,50
his foe, both grab the gun. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS391
01:29:32,00 --> 01:29:39,50
he's hit a wall and they drop it again. Now, the special forces encounter armed Iraqi. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS392
01:29:39,00 --> 01:29:43,50
SOMEONE pins his attacker 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS393
01:29:43,00 --> 01:29:47,50
and duck and hurls him 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS394
01:29:49,00 --> 01:29:53,50
spraying the wall with bullets and blood. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS396
01:30:01,00 --> 01:30:05,50
commandeered rifle and moves. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS400
01:30:25,00 --> 01:30:33,50
He and his aide head upstairs. Now, SOMEONE reaches the same junction and starts for the hall. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS402
01:30:37,00 --> 01:30:42,50
Now, SOMEONE and his attachment reach the sitting room. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS403
01:30:43,00 --> 01:30:49,50
The leader eyes the fallen Iraqi bleeding out on the floor. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS404
01:30:50,00 --> 01:30:56,50
Upstairs, SOMEONE rounds a corner, gets a glimpse of them, and sprints faster. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS405
01:31:00,00 --> 01:31:05,50
As SOMEONE takes the stairs, SOMEONE and his aide exit. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS406
01:31:04,00 --> 01:31:08,50
fire peppers the alley. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS407
01:31:19,00 --> 01:31:23,50
SOMEONE veers right after 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS408
01:31:25,00 --> 01:31:29,50
his man near the building exit. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS412
01:31:51,00 --> 01:31:57,50
SOMEONE heads off. Now, SOMEONE runs under a clothesline. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS415
01:32:06,00 --> 01:32:12,50
the apartment, shuts the door, but SOMEONE immediately bursts through it. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS416
01:32:14,00 --> 01:32:23,50
The general and his aide cross a dim alcove and disappear through a bead curtain doorway. SOMEONE follows, only steps behind. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS417
01:32:33,00 --> 01:32:38,50
Now, as SOMEONE and his aide move on, fiery blasts. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS418
01:32:50,00 --> 01:32:55,50
He kicks in a door, upsetting three Iraqi women and one young kid. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS419
01:33:03,00 --> 01:33:09,50
in a doorway and peers up at the passing surveillance chopper. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS420
01:33:25,00 --> 01:33:29,50
SOMEONE's aide points out a window. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS421
01:33:29,00 --> 01:33:34,50
in a room, the aide uses a radio. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS423
01:33:43,00 --> 01:33:47,50
SOMEONE's aide confers with the general. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS425
01:33:52,00 --> 01:33:58,50
Across a courtyard, they show up on the chopper's monitor. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS426
01:34:01,00 --> 01:34:10,50
He ducks aside with his rifle and covers SOMEONE's advance. The general runs, gripping a pistol. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS428
01:34:40,00 --> 01:34:46,50
SOMEONE stares, his features awash in a fiery glow. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS430
01:35:26,00 --> 01:35:29,50
Return fire kills. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS434
01:35:58,00 --> 01:36:05,50
in a clearing at the market's end, separated by a row of ruined stalls. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS435
01:36:04,00 --> 01:36:07,50
the general. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS437
01:36:18,00 --> 01:36:22,50
SOMEONE runs. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS438
01:36:33,00 --> 01:36:40,50
SOMEONE aims at his fellow American then at the fleeing general. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS439
01:36:43,00 --> 01:36:47,50
fire as SOMEONE's aide shoots him. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS440
01:36:48,00 --> 01:37:08,50
gets to his feet and shoots the bodyguard. Turning, he trains his weapon on SOMEONE. Still holding a pistol, the general raises his hands. He gently tosses his weapon away. Edging closer, SOMEONE glances back at SOMEONE and finds him staring lifelessly. He faces SOMEONE and extends a pointing finger. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS441
01:37:07,00 --> 01:37:19,50
His sweat-soaked chest heaving, the general obeys. As an explosion yards away rains sparks, SOMEONE sidesteps on a path parallel to SOMEONE's. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS442
01:37:17,00 --> 01:37:26,50
Stepping out from behind a low pile of rubble, SOMEONE plants his feet and gazes steadily at SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS443
01:37:26,00 --> 01:37:35,50
SOMEONE's brow knits. A flash of light briefly illuminates SOMEONE's steady undaunted stare the other side. The general falls and SOMEONE aims at the civilian. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS445
01:37:41,00 --> 01:37:46,50
SOMEONE stands motionless. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS446
01:37:45,00 --> 01:37:54,50
Turning, he briefly meets SOMEONE's gaze. He looks back down at the fallen general then tosses his weapon aside. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS447
01:37:54,00 --> 01:38:02,50
His features mostly hidden in shadow, SOMEONE stares at the American with a knitted brow. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS448
01:38:03,00 --> 01:38:15,50
His chest heaves. SOMEONE's glare softens into a stunned gape and he lowers his weapon. The battle scarred local presses his lips closed. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS449
01:38:17,00 --> 01:38:28,50
SOMEONE turns, peering into the shadows at the other end of the market. He faces SOMEONE who firmly stands his ground, hands at his sides. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS450
01:38:37,00 --> 01:38:43,50
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a parting look then lumbers away. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS451
01:38:46,00 --> 01:39:07,50
SOMEONE grimly regards the fallen general, lowers his rifle, and heads back through the marketplace. Small fires burn here and there amid the tattered stalls. As our view drifts above the surrounding buildings, a passing Humvee's headlights sweep over a nearby wall. We peer out over the nighttime city as explosions flash. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS452
01:39:15,00 --> 01:39:45,50
gilded bed in his neglected room, SOMEONE works at a laptop. Key phrases show as he types - under the auspices of the office of, capricious at best and at worst, intentional distortions and false assertions of high ranking officials, spanning all four mobile exploitations, total mission failure, unavoidable suspicion, manufactured intelligence, evidence that a senior civilian, knowingly promoted. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS453
01:39:47,00 --> 01:39:51,50
palace, reports swarm SOMEONE as he arrives. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS454
01:39:52,00 --> 01:39:57,50
Near the entrance, he gravely takes in the crowd of journalists. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS455
01:39:57,00 --> 01:40:11,50
They haul out a load of hard framed trunks and cases. By the bed, the chief adjusts his battle vest and shoulders his backpack. Later, he leaves with his helmet in hand. Now, inside the palace. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS456
01:40:26,00 --> 01:40:34,50
As he and others reach a meeting room, SOMEONE welcomes them. SOMEONE grins at the pentagon official. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS458
01:40:39,00 --> 01:40:51,50
In the sunlit room, local officials stand waiting, some in long Arabic scarves, others in business suits. SOMEONE addresses his new associates. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS459
01:40:50,00 --> 01:40:57,50
In the hall with the press, SOMEONE's smile fades as she spies SOMEONE. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS460
01:40:56,00 --> 01:41:01,50
He sees her staring. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS461
01:41:00,00 --> 01:41:12,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE climbs a stairway. He reaches a landing where a giant American flag covers one of the walls. Through a doorway, he finds SOMEONE giving an interview. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS462
01:41:13,00 --> 01:41:19,50
The Washington official notices the approaching soldier. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS463
01:41:19,00 --> 01:41:25,50
He steps away, intercepting SOMEONE in the adjoining room. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS464
01:41:26,00 --> 01:41:32,50
SOMEONE stares then musters a nod. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS465
01:41:32,00 --> 01:41:45,50
As he peruses the report, SOMEONE watches him coldly. SOMEONE's jaw tightens in a repressed scowl. Looking up from the file, he glances around then lifts his brow. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS466
01:41:52,00 --> 01:41:57,50
SOMEONE bridles then draws himself up. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS467
01:42:03,00 --> 01:42:08,50
He allows a brief smirk. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS468
01:42:22,00 --> 01:42:28,50
SOMEONE backs off, seething at the corrupt official. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS469
01:42:35,00 --> 01:42:39,50
He rejoins his staff. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS470
01:42:38,00 --> 01:42:51,50
SOMEONE notices SOMEONE watching him from a doorway. They share a grim knowing look. Turning away, the soldier lumbers out. SOMEONE bites her lower lip as she stares after him. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS471
01:43:24,00 --> 01:43:33,50
an oscillating fan swivels behind her as other journalists bustle. SOMEONE sets a notepad beside her computer. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS472
01:43:41,00 --> 01:43:48,50
She finds an untitled message from SOMEONE in her email inbox. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS473
01:43:47,00 --> 01:44:30,50
She opens the email which reads, Let's get this story right this time. See attached. SOMEONE glances down, working her laptop touchpad and leans toward her screen. It displays a document titled, Falsification of WMD intel, the truth about Magellan. SOMEONE scans the text. A signature reads, Respectfully, Roy R. SOMEONE, Chief Warrant Officer, US Army. Underneath, a distribution list includes email addresses for virtually every prominent American newspaper, news magazine, and broadcaster. SOMEONE's jaw drops. The list of addresses goes on and on. Summoning a breath, SOMEONE smiles. Now, SOMEONE strides outside through a doorway framed by stained glass panels. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS474
01:44:34,00 --> 01:44:40,50
rolls down a highway. SOMEONE rides shotgun aboard one vehicle. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS475
01:44:46,00 --> 01:44:49,50
and a headset microphone. 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS476
01:44:47,00 --> 01:44:54,50
An aerial view of the parched landscape shows the convoy churning up dust on the 

GREEN_ZONE_DVS477
01:44:54,00 --> 01:45:02,50
forward to the horizon past two enormous oil tanks and other structures in the distance.
