In a mansion

00:05:19,00 --> 00:05:24,50
Outside a car rolls across the lawn. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS15
00:05:26,00 --> 00:05:32,50
The family runs outside. A young girl exits the car. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS20
00:06:13,00 --> 00:06:23,50
At another house a photo shows the five boys with their coach, Outside, a husky guy plays with two kids in an above ground pool. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS21
00:06:23,00 --> 00:06:30,50
As his busty wife brings the phone, he tries to climb out. The pool breaks and 

GROWN_UPS_DVS22
00:06:43,00 --> 00:06:46,50
takes the phone. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS24
00:06:48,00 --> 00:06:52,50
a man ends a call. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS26
00:07:28,00 --> 00:07:34,50
As he storms off, his mother-in-law speaks up. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS27
00:07:33,00 --> 00:07:37,50
In a studio apartment

With a poufy-haired man 

GROWN_UPS_DVS32
00:08:08,00 --> 00:08:15,50
A heavy-set blond on a massage table looks up, her hair hiding her face. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS34
00:08:24,00 --> 00:08:29,50
She's an old woman! 

GROWN_UPS_DVS38
00:08:44,00 --> 00:08:56,50
Words appear. New England. A luxury SUV parks in front of a white-steepled church. Inside, the lanky SOMEONE sits behind the wheel. Beside him, his exotic wife wears

00:09:46,00 --> 00:09:51,50

SOMEONE leans close to SOMEONE. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS50
00:15:36,00 --> 00:15:43,50
Nearby, Mama Ronzoni sits on her grandson's handheld video game. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS54
00:16:13,00 --> 00:16:25,50
SOMEONE stands nervously. He makes his way down the aisle of packed pews, then steps up in front of the flower-adorned casket. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS57
00:17:41,00 --> 00:17:46,50
Later, SOMEONE sings. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS61
00:18:22,00 --> 00:18:29,50
The pastor stares, aghast. In the pews, SOMEONE and SOMEONE crack 

GROWN_UPS_DVS62

SOMEONE pinches SOMEONE. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS76
00:22:15,00 --> 00:22:21,50
She crosses the porch. SOMEONE opens the door. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS79
00:23:49,00 --> 00:24:00,50
SOMEONE smiles tightly. Exploring the room, SOMEONE and SOMEONE find an old TV set and knock on its bulky casing. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS83
00:25:02,00 --> 00:25:06,50
He stands. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS84
00:25:06,00 --> 00:25:13,50

00:32:13,00 --> 00:32:18,50
Everyone looks over. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS100
00:33:33,00 --> 00:33:38,50
His wife gives him a look.

She throws down her napkin and storms off. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS102
00:34:06,00 --> 00:34:11,50
Outside a restroom, 

GROWN_UPS_DVS107
00:34:43,00 --> 00:34:47,50
SOMEONE carries a shoebox. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS109
00:35:37,00 --> 00:35:40,50

00:36:06,00 --> 00:36:11,50
SOMEONE leaves confusedly. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS113
00:36:40,00 --> 00:36:46,50
From the porch, Mama Ronzoni looks in at the dog. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS114
00:37:09,00 --> 00:37:17,50
Now sitting outside on the porch, SOMEONE places a strip of bacon on the bug zapper. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS115
00:37:15,00 --> 00:37:22,50
He sets down another strip. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS116
00:37:21,00 --> 00:37:29,50
He spots SOMEONE picking up a rock near the lake. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS117
00:37:30,00 --> 00:37:34,50
He just stares at it. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS118
00:37:43,00 --> 00:37:49,50
SOMEONE drops the rock back on the ground. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS119
00:37:48,00 --> 00:37:52,50
SOMEONE wears pantaloons. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS120
00:38:08,00 --> 00:38:12,50
He sulks off. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS122
00:38:37,00 --> 00:38:42,50
SOMEONE stops chewing. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS123
00:38:40,00 --> 00:38:44,50
He pulls a moth from his mouth. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS125
00:39:01,00 --> 00:39:06,50
and SOMEONE rows alone. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS127
00:40:04,00 --> 00:40:12,50
SOMEONE stands facing the water and wrinkles his brow. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS129
00:40:44,00 --> 00:40:51,50
the island, SOMEONE carries a bucket of KFC and SOMEONE totes a boom box. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS133
00:41:48,00 --> 00:41:55,50
Holding the basketball net around the urn, SOMEONE removes its lid. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS134
00:41:55,00 --> 00:42:00,50
He takes a handful of ashes and tosses them. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS135
00:41:59,00 --> 00:42:06,50
He retrieves more and scatters it into the air with an underhand throw. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS136
00:42:07,00 --> 00:42:16,50
Stifling a grin, SOMEONE exchanges a glance with SOMEONE. SOMEONE closes the urn and bows his head. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS139
00:43:18,00 --> 00:43:23,50
in denim short-shorts and a midriff 

GROWN_UPS_DVS140
00:43:27,00 --> 00:43:32,50
The young woman eyes them. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS141
00:43:32,00 --> 00:43:37,50
SOMEONE steps past his friends and heads over. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS142
00:43:45,00 --> 00:43:50,50
He hugs her. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS144
00:44:22,00 --> 00:44:29,50
Andre and SOMEONE watch from inside SOMEONE's car. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS145
00:44:32,00 --> 00:44:42,50
Later, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE sit in chairs watching as SOMEONE leans over her car to fix it. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS146
00:44:47,00 --> 00:44:53,50
They ogle SOMEONE's long legs and butt. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS147
00:45:02,00 --> 00:45:08,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare at SOMEONE while the other two look away. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS148
00:45:06,00 --> 00:45:10,50
They switch. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS149
00:45:14,00 --> 00:45:19,50
They stare in the same direction. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS151
00:45:27,00 --> 00:45:31,50
Gloria hugs her. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS152
00:45:33,00 --> 00:45:39,50
She dons her glasses and peers under the hood. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS153
00:45:40,00 --> 00:45:44,50
Using pliers, she removes a lid 

GROWN_UPS_DVS154
00:45:47,00 --> 00:45:50,50
out. Her hair blows backwards 

GROWN_UPS_DVS155
00:45:49,00 --> 00:45:53,50
and forward. SOMEONE watches 

GROWN_UPS_DVS156
00:45:52,00 --> 00:45:57,50
flapping in the breeze. They playfully fight over 

GROWN_UPS_DVS157
00:45:55,00 --> 00:45:59,50
in a churning motion 

GROWN_UPS_DVS158
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:06,50
They turn their chairs away. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS159
00:46:03,00 --> 00:46:08,50
They fish from the boathouse. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS165
00:47:17,00 --> 00:47:21,50
now in the woods 

GROWN_UPS_DVS166
00:47:47,00 --> 00:47:59,50
In slow motion, SOMEONE sprints with wide eyes, his mouth agape, while SOMEONE runs with his hands over his head. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS168
00:48:03,00 --> 00:48:07,50
and drops to his knees. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS170
00:48:11,00 --> 00:48:17,50
terrified eyes fixed on the sky, a tree branch clotheslines him. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS171
00:48:18,00 --> 00:48:22,50
Holding his cramped leg, SOMEONE looks 

GROWN_UPS_DVS172
00:48:24,00 --> 00:48:30,50
and he races over to the dog as the arrow plummets to the ground. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS173
00:48:31,00 --> 00:48:35,50
He throws the dog over his shoulder. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS174
00:48:35,00 --> 00:48:40,50
The lanky hero steps on SOMEONE as he runs 

GROWN_UPS_DVS175
00:48:49,00 --> 00:48:53,50
The arrow lands in SOMEONE's foot! 

GROWN_UPS_DVS176
00:50:20,00 --> 00:50:25,50
Now in a bedroom, SOMEONE sits studying in a 

GROWN_UPS_DVS177
00:50:25,00 --> 00:50:32,50
SOMEONE packs a suitcase. She faces SOMEONE with a wide-eyed glare. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS180
00:51:12,00 --> 00:51:17,50
SOMEONE freezes, her eyes widening. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS181
00:51:16,00 --> 00:51:21,50
With a guilty stare, she takes a deep breath. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS182
00:51:21,00 --> 00:51:30,50
SOMEONE runs from the room. SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE who hurries out after her. With a remorseful gaze. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS183
00:51:28,00 --> 00:51:33,50
She sits down on a bench at the foot of the bed. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS184
00:51:33,00 --> 00:51:40,50
Later, she sits up in bed while SOMEONE packs. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS187
00:52:09,00 --> 00:52:15,50
She buries herself under the covers. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS188
00:52:20,00 --> 00:52:24,50
using cups and string 

GROWN_UPS_DVS190
00:53:13,00 --> 00:53:20,50
SOMEONE frowns at the cup in his hand, then puts it to his ear. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS191
00:53:18,00 --> 00:53:32,50
He quickly lowers it. Smiling bemusedly, he follows the out another door and down a hallway. He peeks around a corner. The string leads to a chair where Mama Ronzoni sits knitting. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS192
00:53:31,00 --> 00:53:36,50
Now in bed, SOMEONE uses a cup phone. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS197
00:54:28,00 --> 00:54:40,50
The next morning at a kitchen table, SOMEONE feeds the injured bird with liquid from a narrow tube. It leads to a pump on SOMEONE's breast. SOMEONE watches. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS199
00:54:55,00 --> 00:55:03,50
Now SOMEONE stands by the SUV composing a text message as SOMEONE sits buried inside 

GROWN_UPS_DVS201
00:55:04,00 --> 00:55:10,50
The mother pauses and looks to the lake shore where her kids skep stones with their 

GROWN_UPS_DVS202
00:55:19,00 --> 00:55:24,50
SOMEONE heads over. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS203
00:55:26,00 --> 00:55:31,50
Donna skips the stone across the water. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS205
00:55:51,00 --> 00:55:55,50
In the house, 

GROWN_UPS_DVS206
00:56:33,00 --> 00:56:39,50
SOMEONE crosses to his beaming wife. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS208
00:57:07,00 --> 00:57:12,50
SOMEONE stoically spits some out. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS209
00:57:40,00 --> 00:57:44,50
cones in their hands as they walk. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS210
00:57:50,00 --> 00:57:54,50
SOMEONE arrives. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS211
00:57:53,00 --> 00:57:57,50
It's an unrevealing one-piece 

GROWN_UPS_DVS212
00:58:13,00 --> 00:58:17,50
slinky bathing suit, SOMEONE quick 

GROWN_UPS_DVS213
00:58:46,00 --> 00:58:50,50
The others follow her gaze. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS216
00:59:34,00 --> 00:59:39,50
SOMEONE sips from the carton. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS220
01:01:20,00 --> 01:01:24,50
They gape lustfully. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS221
01:01:29,00 --> 01:01:33,50
He has dazzling smile. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS224
01:04:38,00 --> 01:04:43,50
He zip line across the park. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS226
01:05:47,00 --> 01:05:52,50
He steps up to the platform and grabs the handles. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS227
01:06:53,00 --> 01:06:58,50
Now at the lake house, the fathers and sons play 

GROWN_UPS_DVS228
01:06:57,00 --> 01:07:01,50
SOMEONE to throw horseshoes. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS230
01:07:13,00 --> 01:07:19,50
SOMEONE watches SOMEONE gesture to her breasts. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS232
01:07:49,00 --> 01:07:53,50
SOMEONE stares at Amber and Jan 

GROWN_UPS_DVS233
01:07:54,00 --> 01:07:58,50
stares, too. SOMEONE catches 

GROWN_UPS_DVS234
01:08:20,00 --> 01:08:28,50
She spots her husband wading in the lake with SOMEONE as she catches guppies in a jar. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS235
01:08:34,00 --> 01:08:40,50
lake lodge. Inside, the adults toast marshmallows. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS241
01:11:05,00 --> 01:11:08,50
each other gracefully 

GROWN_UPS_DVS243
01:12:05,00 --> 01:12:13,50
Later at the lake house, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE asleep on the couch and slaps him on the forehead. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS244
01:12:13,00 --> 01:12:20,50
SOMEONE stands in the kitchen with a jug of water. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS247
01:12:31,00 --> 01:12:38,50
SOMEONE gets another jug from the fridge and both men guzzle their water. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS250
01:12:41,00 --> 01:12:46,50
They gulp some more. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS251
01:12:48,00 --> 01:12:55,50
They guzzle again. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS256
01:13:29,00 --> 01:13:32,50
SOMEONE's forehead. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS257
01:13:36,00 --> 01:13:41,50
He flutters his hands against SOMEONE's face. SOMEONE 

GROWN_UPS_DVS259
01:13:58,00 --> 01:14:03,50
He walks his fingers over SOMEONE's forehead. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS261
01:14:39,00 --> 01:14:46,50
morning, the families raise the American flag on the boathouse's rooftop patio. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS262
01:14:55,00 --> 01:15:00,50
Later in the lake house, SOMEONE works 

GROWN_UPS_DVS264
01:15:22,00 --> 01:15:28,50
SOMEONE staggers out of the closet. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS265
01:15:28,00 --> 01:15:36,50
Mama Ronzoni's funeral hat. He finds the breast pump on his nipple. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS266
01:15:48,00 --> 01:15:54,50
Curly steps out of the closet and stands beside him. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS269
01:17:30,00 --> 01:17:34,50
He lowers the ice, revealing a cut. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS271
01:19:04,00 --> 01:19:10,50
SOMEONE and Andre duck behind the stairs. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS273
01:20:01,00 --> 01:20:05,50
SOMEONE eyes him. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS281
01:24:47,00 --> 01:24:51,50
SOMEONE and Donna climb the 

GROWN_UPS_DVS282
01:25:59,00 --> 01:26:04,50
stop. Later on a basketball court, 

GROWN_UPS_DVS284
01:27:09,00 --> 01:27:14,50
SOMEONE stands and limps forward. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS286
01:27:43,00 --> 01:27:49,50
Now, SOMEONE points. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS287
01:27:49,00 --> 01:27:53,50
of a hill, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE 

GROWN_UPS_DVS289
01:31:21,00 --> 01:31:26,50
He eats his daughter's dessert instead. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS291
01:31:56,00 --> 01:32:04,50
Bending over, Riley lowers his raised arms. His hand rubs SOMEONE's breast! 

GROWN_UPS_DVS292
01:32:08,00 --> 01:32:12,50
some spectators 

GROWN_UPS_DVS293
01:33:19,00 --> 01:33:35,50
In slow motion, SOMEONE eyes the open basket then looks at Bailey's disheartened expression. Pressing his lips together, he shifts his gaze to Bailey's wife, who watches hopefully. SOMEONE turns back to the basket and shoots. The ball arcs into the 

GROWN_UPS_DVS294
01:33:33,00 --> 01:33:41,50
air. Hitting the backboard, it drops onto the basket's rim then bounces away from the net. The 

GROWN_UPS_DVS295
01:33:57,00 --> 01:34:02,50
hugs his teammates and the crowd rushes over. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS297
01:35:21,00 --> 01:35:26,50
He produces a bow and arrow. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS298
01:36:03,00 --> 01:36:07,50
He looks up. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS299
01:36:09,00 --> 01:36:13,50
He grins. 

GROWN_UPS_DVS300
01:36:12,00 --> 01:36:18,50
His eyes roll back and he faints.
