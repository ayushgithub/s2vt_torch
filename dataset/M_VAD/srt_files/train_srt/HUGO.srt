HUGO_DVS22
00:02:51,00 --> 00:02:58,50
He jogs up a corridor then kicks open a coal door and slides down a spiraling chute. 

HUGO_DVS23
00:03:00,00 --> 00:03:08,50
At the bottom, he runs past damp brick walls then scurries through a labyrinth of pipes and machinery. 

HUGO_DVS24
00:03:06,00 --> 00:03:12,50
He ducks through a large gear with thick spokes then races up a spiral staircase. 

HUGO_DVS25
00:03:13,00 --> 00:03:23,50
Turning down another narrow hallway with steam rising through the grating, the boy reaches another clock powered by a complex mechanism of spinning gears. 

HUGO_DVS26
00:03:20,00 --> 00:03:34,50
He peers through the clock's open numbers at a toy shop below. Surrounded by dolls, rocking horses, musical instruments, and other items, a bearded white-haired man sits behind the counter with his chin propped on one hand. 

HUGO_DVS27
00:03:31,00 --> 00:03:37,50
The man glances sideways and narrows his eyes as he studies the clock. 

HUGO_DVS28
00:03:35,00 --> 00:03:40,50
The boy stares back through the number four. 

HUGO_DVS30
00:03:39,00 --> 00:03:44,50
The man releases a wind-up mouse, watches it scoot across the counter,  

HUGO_DVS31
00:03:43,00 --> 00:03:50,50
then retrieves it.  

HUGO_DVS32
00:03:48,00 --> 00:03:53,50
A brown-haired girl wearing a beret steps up beside the man and sets down a loaf of bread.  

HUGO_DVS33
00:03:50,00 --> 00:03:55,50
He gestures towards the back of the shop.  

HUGO_DVS35
00:03:56,00 --> 00:04:01,50
The girl stands and smiles at the man. Looking at her, he shrugs then nods emphatically.  

HUGO_DVS36
00:04:05,00 --> 00:04:11,50
Slowly, she turns and walks away with the bread. The boy watches as the man lowers his head and shuts his eyes. 

HUGO_DVS38
00:04:17,00 --> 00:04:25,50
His hands rest on the counter, a few inches from the wind-up mouse. Crouching, the boy leaves the clock and scuttles along a crawlspace beneath the walkway. 

HUGO_DVS39
00:04:27,00 --> 00:04:34,50
He swings open a small metal grate then steps into a tiled corridor, opposite the shop. 

HUGO_DVS41
00:04:34,00 --> 00:04:38,50
Confiserie et Juet, or candy and toy shop. 

HUGO_DVS42
00:04:39,00 --> 00:04:46,50
Wearing a tattered coat, shorts, and sweater, the boy creeps toward the store. 

HUGO_DVS43
00:04:50,00 --> 00:04:59,50
The white-haired man dozes behind the counter. As the boy reaches the toy shop, he reaches one hand toward the wind-up mouse. 

HUGO_DVS44
00:05:01,00 --> 00:05:06,50
The man suddenly snatches his arm. 

HUGO_DVS45
00:05:06,00 --> 00:05:10,50
The mouse falls and breaks. 

HUGO_DVS46
00:05:19,00 --> 00:05:31,50
The boy reaches into his coat pocket then sets items onto the counter: a pocketknife, bundle of string, and a piece of cloth filled with small sprockets, gears, and springs. 

HUGO_DVS47
00:05:39,00 --> 00:05:49,50
The boy glances over his shoulder then reaches into his other pocket. Glaring at the man, he takes out a small notebook and slaps it onto the counter. 

HUGO_DVS48
00:05:46,00 --> 00:05:52,50
The man releases the boy's arm then opens the notebook. 

HUGO_DVS49
00:05:55,00 --> 00:06:00,50
He frowns as he flips through the pages. 

HUGO_DVS50
00:05:58,00 --> 00:06:05,50
Handwritten notes, mathematical equations, and schematic drawings fill the pages. 

HUGO_DVS51
00:06:02,00 --> 00:06:09,50
The man inhales sharply as he flips to drawings of a mechanical man's head and torso. 

HUGO_DVS52
00:06:12,00 --> 00:06:22,50
The shopkeeper squeezes his eyes shut. As he rapidly flips the pages, the drawings become an animation of the automaton turning its head. 

HUGO_DVS53
00:07:00,00 --> 00:07:06,50
The man shakes the notebook in the boy's face then frowns and slaps it onto the counter. 

HUGO_DVS54
00:07:06,00 --> 00:07:11,50
Across the station, the station inspector lifts his head. 

HUGO_DVS55
00:07:18,00 --> 00:07:24,50
The station inspector removes the leash from his dog, who then runs off. The inspector limps through the crowd after him. 

HUGO_DVS57
00:07:31,00 --> 00:07:40,50
The dog skids across the polished floor as he runs up the hallway opposite the toyshop. The boy spins around then takes off into the crowd. 

HUGO_DVS58
00:07:40,00 --> 00:07:47,50
Swinging out his unbending left leg as he runs, the inspector follows after them. 

HUGO_DVS59
00:07:44,00 --> 00:07:55,50
He slams into a woman, spins, then falls on top of her. The five-piece band plays in the cafe as the boy leaps over a bench and upsets a dining table. 

HUGO_DVS60
00:07:56,00 --> 00:08:03,50
The boy zips through the cafe, then weaves his way through tables out front. 

HUGO_DVS61
00:08:02,00 --> 00:08:15,50
A woman clutches a small little dog to her chest as the Doberman skids past a large tiered cake, races past the band, then runs out of the other side of the cafe. The station inspector dashes into the cafe. 

HUGO_DVS63
00:08:19,00 --> 00:08:30,50
Hurtling toward the cake, the inspector turns and crashes into the band. He puts his foot through a bass guitar and falls into the band members. The inspector struggles to his feet. 

HUGO_DVS64
00:08:31,00 --> 00:08:38,50
Gripping a SOMEONE club, the inspector runs out the other end of the cafe. 

HUGO_DVS65
00:08:35,00 --> 00:08:42,50
Up ahead, the boy dashes through the crowd then slides under a newspaper vendor's legs. 

HUGO_DVS66
00:08:42,00 --> 00:08:50,50
The inspector shoves past the man, then pushes his way into a throng of travelers standing on a train platform. 

HUGO_DVS67
00:08:47,00 --> 00:08:54,50
He limps up the platform along the edge of the tracks, pushing people out of the way as he goes. 

HUGO_DVS68
00:09:00,00 --> 00:09:06,50
The inspector reaches the end of the platform and gazes around himself. 

HUGO_DVS69
00:09:04,00 --> 00:09:13,50
His dog paces in a circle. Above them, the boy paces along a narrow catwalk, running across the tracks as a train leaves the station. 

HUGO_DVS70
00:09:12,00 --> 00:09:17,50
The inspector throws down his club. 

HUGO_DVS71
00:09:17,00 --> 00:09:22,50
The passing train snags the inspector's leg brace. 

HUGO_DVS72
00:09:23,00 --> 00:09:28,50
He falls and the train drags him along the platform. 

HUGO_DVS73
00:09:33,00 --> 00:09:51,50
He slides into a suitcase, which strikes him in the crotch. The dog lies down and lowers his head. Meanwhile, the boy jogs up a grimy corridor filled with gears and steaming pipes. He crawls through a gap in a mesh screen then hops through the spokes of a large gear as it spins. The boy turns down a hallway then opens a metal door. 

HUGO_DVS74
00:09:49,00 --> 00:09:53,50
He peeks inside. 

HUGO_DVS75
00:09:54,00 --> 00:10:01,50
Reaching into a pocket, the boy takes out a set of keys as he approaches another metal door. 

HUGO_DVS76
00:10:04,00 --> 00:10:10,50
He slides a latch then shoves open the heavy door. 

HUGO_DVS77
00:10:07,00 --> 00:10:14,50
The boy enters an attic with a wood-plank floor and shuts the door behind him. 

HUGO_DVS78
00:10:11,00 --> 00:10:20,50
Light shines in through narrow windows along the slanted ceiling and illuminates spinning gears and exposed steel girders. 

HUGO_DVS79
00:10:27,00 --> 00:10:34,50
The boy crosses to a small area in front of three large windows which has been swept clean. 

HUGO_DVS80
00:10:32,00 --> 00:10:38,50
He steps to a worktable covered in gears, sprockets, and schematic drawings. 

HUGO_DVS81
00:10:36,00 --> 00:10:41,50
He picks up one gear and compares it to a drawing, 

HUGO_DVS82
00:10:38,00 --> 00:10:42,50
then tosses it aside. 

HUGO_DVS83
00:10:47,00 --> 00:10:52,50
Setting his jaw, the boy leaves. 

HUGO_DVS84
00:10:49,00 --> 00:10:57,50
He climbs down a metal ladder to a large square clock suspended over train station platforms. 

HUGO_DVS85
00:10:58,00 --> 00:11:04,50
Inside, the boy attaches a handle to the clockwork mechanism and cranks it. 

HUGO_DVS86
00:11:02,00 --> 00:11:07,50
He oils a gear then stares down at the crowd below. 

HUGO_DVS87
00:11:09,00 --> 00:11:16,50
Outside the cafe, the brown-haired woman still holds her little dog to her chest. 

HUGO_DVS88
00:11:14,00 --> 00:11:20,50
The news vendor - a rotund man wearing glasses and a beret - approaches the woman. 

HUGO_DVS89
00:11:18,00 --> 00:11:24,50
She nods and the man reaches his hand toward her dog. 

HUGO_DVS90
00:11:37,00 --> 00:11:42,50
The boy smiles. 

HUGO_DVS91
00:11:46,00 --> 00:11:59,50
Later, he trudges up a metal staircase inside a square tower. Clouds of steam rise up the lofty tower and drift past an enormous pendulum swinging back and forth. 

HUGO_DVS92
00:11:56,00 --> 00:12:11,50
At the top, large clocks face out from every side. Each controlled by a single mechanism with immense gears. Inching around some stray pigeons, the boy climbs a stepladder beside the mechanism and switches on a lightbulb hanging from a chain. 

HUGO_DVS93
00:12:08,00 --> 00:12:14,50
He cranks a thick handle protruding from the side of the mechanism. 

HUGO_DVS94
00:12:16,00 --> 00:12:23,50
Stopping his efforts, the boy gazes out the center of a clock face. 

HUGO_DVS95
00:12:24,00 --> 00:12:29,50
The sun sets behind the Eiffel Tower in the distance. 

HUGO_DVS96
00:12:31,00 --> 00:12:37,50
Slowly, he creeps forward and stares out through the clear glass. 

HUGO_DVS97
00:12:41,00 --> 00:12:52,50
He stands motionless at the top of the clock tower, as the setting sun casts long shadows over the train station and the rest of the sprawling city. 

HUGO_DVS98
00:12:56,00 --> 00:13:00,50
The white-haired man pulls down a gate as he closes his shop. 

HUGO_DVS99
00:13:08,00 --> 00:13:13,50
The man turns and faces the boy. 

HUGO_DVS101
00:13:47,00 --> 00:13:51,50
The man strides off. 

HUGO_DVS102
00:13:48,00 --> 00:13:54,50
SOMEONE stares after him, then follows through the mostly deserted train station. 

HUGO_DVS103
00:13:52,00 --> 00:13:57,50
SOMEONE strides closer as they reach the front entrance. 

HUGO_DVS104
00:13:59,00 --> 00:14:05,50
The shopkeeper turns his back on SOMEONE and walks out. 

HUGO_DVS105
00:14:07,00 --> 00:14:14,50
SOMEONE stands rooted to the floor, gazing out at the snowy Paris streets beyond. 

HUGO_DVS106
00:14:16,00 --> 00:14:21,50
SOMEONE throws open the doors and steps outside. 

HUGO_DVS107
00:14:19,00 --> 00:14:27,50
Shivering against the cold, SOMEONE follows several paces behind the shopkeeper as he crosses a wide brick street. 

HUGO_DVS108
00:14:27,00 --> 00:14:36,50
SOMEONE rubs his hands together as the man trudges up stone steps then turns down a street lined with tall tenements. 

HUGO_DVS109
00:14:34,00 --> 00:14:39,50
The twin towers of Notre Dame loom in the distance. 

HUGO_DVS110
00:14:37,00 --> 00:14:43,50
SOMEONE glances over his shoulder as he trails the man into an alley. 

HUGO_DVS111
00:14:40,00 --> 00:14:48,50
Hurrying his pace, he falls in step beside the man - who doesn't acknowledge SOMEONE's presence. 

HUGO_DVS112
00:14:46,00 --> 00:14:56,50
They approach a gate leading to a cemetery filled with snow dusted statues of hooded figures standing with their hands clasped and their heads bowed. 

HUGO_DVS113
00:14:57,00 --> 00:15:02,50
SOMEONE stares up at the statues as he passes. 

HUGO_DVS114
00:15:03,00 --> 00:15:12,50
The man walks out of a gate on the opposite side then enters a building's front door- which he shuts in SOMEONE's face. 

HUGO_DVS115
00:15:14,00 --> 00:15:18,50
SOMEONE furrows his brow. 

HUGO_DVS116
00:15:16,00 --> 00:15:23,50
He steps back and stares up at the building as a train passes along an elevated track nearby. 

HUGO_DVS117
00:15:21,00 --> 00:15:28,50
The girl who visited the shopkeeper earlier is visible in an upper window. 

HUGO_DVS118
00:15:25,00 --> 00:15:31,50
In the window beside it, the shopkeeper steps beside a curly-haired woman. 

HUGO_DVS119
00:15:38,00 --> 00:15:43,50
SOMEONE tosses a pebble at the girl's window. 

HUGO_DVS120
00:15:40,00 --> 00:15:45,50
She stands and looks down at him. 

HUGO_DVS121
00:15:43,00 --> 00:15:50,50
SOMEONE motions for her to come outside then presses his palms together and pleads. 

HUGO_DVS122
00:15:48,00 --> 00:15:53,50
Frowning, the girl glances over her shoulder. 

HUGO_DVS123
00:15:50,00 --> 00:15:56,50
A moment later, she opens the front door and steps outside. 

HUGO_DVS124
00:16:20,00 --> 00:16:25,50
The girl stares at SOMEONE with her arms crossed. 

HUGO_DVS125
00:16:33,00 --> 00:16:37,50
She steps toward him. 

HUGO_DVS126
00:16:53,00 --> 00:16:58,50
SOMEONE plants his feet and folds his arms. 

HUGO_DVS127
00:17:09,00 --> 00:17:13,50
Smiling, the girl nods. 

HUGO_DVS128
00:17:10,00 --> 00:17:16,50
SOMEONE nods back then turns and runs through the small cemetery. 

HUGO_DVS129
00:17:21,00 --> 00:17:27,50
Back in the attic, SOMEONE lights a candle and sets it onto a chair seat. 

HUGO_DVS130
00:17:24,00 --> 00:17:33,50
He turns and yanks a sheet off a doll-sized mechanical man - or automaton - sitting at a small table. 

HUGO_DVS131
00:17:30,00 --> 00:17:35,50
The automaton's head and hands are solid, 

HUGO_DVS132
00:17:32,00 --> 00:17:38,50
while it's arms and torso are an open metal framework. 

HUGO_DVS133
00:17:35,00 --> 00:17:41,50
Gears and sprockets fill the automaton's chest cavity. 

HUGO_DVS134
00:17:40,00 --> 00:17:46,50
SOMEONE sits across from the automaton and stares at its solid black eyes. 

HUGO_DVS135
00:17:46,00 --> 00:17:52,50
As the light flickers, clothes materialize on the metallic man. 

HUGO_DVS136
00:18:08,00 --> 00:18:14,50
Now well dressed and clean, SOMEONE stands with a blonde man with glasses. 

HUGO_DVS137
00:18:26,00 --> 00:18:31,50
The man sets a small table in front of the automaton. 

HUGO_DVS138
00:18:55,00 --> 00:19:02,50
SOMEONE's father opens the automaton's shirt and exposes its interior mechanism. 

HUGO_DVS139
00:19:09,00 --> 00:19:14,50
SOMEONE's father shrugs, then smiles, and hugs him. 

HUGO_DVS140
00:19:23,00 --> 00:19:30,50
SOMEONE watches his father place a gear assembly into the automaton's chest. 

HUGO_DVS141
00:19:37,00 --> 00:19:45,50
Later, his father repairs a clock in his shop, which is filled with various gears and mechanisms. 

HUGO_DVS142
00:19:42,00 --> 00:19:46,50
SOMEONE sweeps nearby. 

HUGO_DVS143
00:19:44,00 --> 00:19:51,50
At night, his father runs a finger over a heart-shaped keyhole in the automaton's back. 

HUGO_DVS144
00:20:04,00 --> 00:20:10,50
He flips through his notebook to a page with drawings of a heart-shaped key. 

HUGO_DVS145
00:20:07,00 --> 00:20:12,50
SOMEONE watches him add another sketch. 

HUGO_DVS146
00:20:15,00 --> 00:20:20,50
Back in the train station, tears well in SOMEONE's eyes. 

HUGO_DVS147
00:20:18,00 --> 00:20:27,50
In a museum, SOMEONE's father furrows his brow as he studies a mechanical model of a large sphere with orbiting satellites. 

HUGO_DVS148
00:20:25,00 --> 00:20:32,50
Standing by a rotating film reel, he glances back over his shoulder and frowns. 

HUGO_DVS149
00:20:34,00 --> 00:20:39,50
SOMEONE's father walks through the museum, 

HUGO_DVS150
00:20:36,00 --> 00:20:42,50
passing a sarcophagus adorned with the figure of a pope. 

HUGO_DVS151
00:20:42,00 --> 00:20:50,50
He steps slowly past marble statues and other works of antiquity and gazes at a pair of closed doors. 

HUGO_DVS152
00:20:53,00 --> 00:21:00,50
As he throws open the doors, flames twist up a staircase and engulf him. 

HUGO_DVS153
00:21:04,00 --> 00:21:10,50
Back in the shop, SOMEONE polishes the automaton with a strip of cloth. 

HUGO_DVS154
00:21:14,00 --> 00:21:20,50
A mustached man wearing a bowler staggers into the room. 

HUGO_DVS155
00:21:20,00 --> 00:21:26,50
Claude takes a drag from his cigarette, burns his finger, and drops it. 

HUGO_DVS156
00:21:29,00 --> 00:21:34,50
SOMEONE stares at his uncle then lowers his eyes. 

HUGO_DVS157
00:21:42,00 --> 00:21:48,50
SOMEONE's eyes flip from side to side as he stares downward. 

HUGO_DVS158
00:21:48,00 --> 00:21:54,50
SOMEONE recoils as Claude sways into a grandfather clock. 

HUGO_DVS159
00:21:52,00 --> 00:21:57,50
Claude palms a nearby pocket watch and places it into his coat. 

HUGO_DVS160
00:21:55,00 --> 00:22:00,50
Later, SOMEONE carries the automaton. 

HUGO_DVS161
00:22:05,00 --> 00:22:11,50
Claude takes a swig from a flask, as he leads SOMEONE to the station. 

HUGO_DVS162
00:22:18,00 --> 00:22:23,50
They walk into the attic storeroom. 

HUGO_DVS163
00:23:03,00 --> 00:23:07,50
SOMEONE unwraps the automaton. 

HUGO_DVS164
00:23:18,00 --> 00:23:23,50
Claude and SOMEONE visit a grave site. 

HUGO_DVS165
00:23:24,00 --> 00:23:30,50
Alone with the automaton, SOMEONE blinks away tears. 

HUGO_DVS167
00:23:34,00 --> 00:23:41,50
In the station, the brown-haired woman walks her little dog to the cafe and opens the door. 

HUGO_DVS168
00:23:40,00 --> 00:23:45,50
SOMEONE peers through the vent at a tray of steaming croissants. 

HUGO_DVS169
00:23:43,00 --> 00:23:49,50
The news vendor smiles as he approaches the woman and her dog. 

HUGO_DVS170
00:23:58,00 --> 00:24:03,50
As he offers the woman a paper, her dog bites him. 

HUGO_DVS171
00:24:08,00 --> 00:24:13,50
Her dog pulls her away from the cafe. 

HUGO_DVS172
00:24:10,00 --> 00:24:17,50
As station agents rush to her aide, SOMEONE sneaks out of the vent and creeps toward the tray of croissants. 

HUGO_DVS173
00:24:22,00 --> 00:24:28,50
Glancing around himself, he steals a roll and a bottle of milk then walks off. 

HUGO_DVS174
00:24:31,00 --> 00:24:38,50
Wearing his leg brace, the station inspector paces down a staircase and surveys the crowd. 

HUGO_DVS175
00:24:44,00 --> 00:24:49,50
He leans back against a pillar. 

HUGO_DVS176
00:24:46,00 --> 00:24:52,50
Still chewing, SOMEONE stands on the other side of the pillar. 

HUGO_DVS177
00:24:50,00 --> 00:24:57,50
He freezes as the inspector takes out a pocket watch and checks the time. 

HUGO_DVS178
00:24:54,00 --> 00:25:03,50
SOMEONE ducks as the inspector stretches back his arms, then hides behind the pillar as the inspector turns his head. 

HUGO_DVS179
00:25:06,00 --> 00:25:11,50
SOMEONE flees in the opposite direction. 

HUGO_DVS180
00:25:17,00 --> 00:25:24,50
Nearby, the brown-haired flower seller smiles as she pushes her cart through the station. 

HUGO_DVS181
00:25:27,00 --> 00:25:34,50
Straightening his hat, the inspector walks stiffly towards the woman as she sets up shop. 

HUGO_DVS182
00:25:44,00 --> 00:25:51,50
Grimacing, the inspector reaches down and unlocks his leg brace. 

HUGO_DVS183
00:25:50,00 --> 00:25:56,50
He glances toward the flower seller then turns and limps off in the other direction. 

HUGO_DVS184
00:26:03,00 --> 00:26:08,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE opens the toyshop. 

HUGO_DVS185
00:26:10,00 --> 00:26:14,50
He turns and faces SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS186
00:26:27,00 --> 00:26:34,50
Staring at SOMEONE, SOMEONE steps forward and hands him a small parcel wrapped in cloth. 

HUGO_DVS187
00:26:44,00 --> 00:26:51,50
As SOMEONE opens it, ashes and flakes of charred paper spill onto the floor. 

HUGO_DVS188
00:26:56,00 --> 00:27:01,50
Sobs shake SOMEONE's shoulders. 

HUGO_DVS189
00:26:59,00 --> 00:27:03,50
He looks up at SOMEONE 

HUGO_DVS190
00:27:01,00 --> 00:27:05,50
with tears streaming down his cheeks. 

HUGO_DVS191
00:27:03,00 --> 00:27:08,50
SOMEONE presses his lips together 

HUGO_DVS192
00:27:05,00 --> 00:27:10,50
then jerks his head to one side. 

HUGO_DVS193
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:20,50
SOMEONE wipes his face with a sooty hand then runs off. 

HUGO_DVS194
00:27:19,00 --> 00:27:25,50
Turning the corner, he barrels into the brown-haired girl. 

HUGO_DVS195
00:27:32,00 --> 00:27:37,50
She cleans his face with a handkerchief. 

HUGO_DVS196
00:28:18,00 --> 00:28:25,50
The white-haired bookseller raises his eyebrows as he examines SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS197
00:28:43,00 --> 00:28:50,50
SOMEONE stares at the bookseller as he follows SOMEONE to the back of the shop. 

HUGO_DVS198
00:30:04,00 --> 00:30:08,50
SOMEONE blinks and looks down. 

HUGO_DVS199
00:30:08,00 --> 00:30:12,50
She glances at SOMEONE and grins. 

HUGO_DVS200
00:30:12,00 --> 00:30:17,50
SOMEONE selects a book. 

HUGO_DVS201
00:30:27,00 --> 00:30:33,50
SOMEONE shakes SOMEONE's shoulder, smiles, and leaves. 

HUGO_DVS202
00:30:30,00 --> 00:30:35,50
Scowling, he marches off. 

HUGO_DVS203
00:30:36,00 --> 00:30:42,50
SOMEONE stands in front of the toyshop and stares at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS204
00:30:43,00 --> 00:30:47,50
SOMEONE narrows his eyes. 

HUGO_DVS205
00:30:45,00 --> 00:30:53,50
Without glancing away from the boy, he reaches under the counter then drops the broken wind-up mouse in front of SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS206
00:30:57,00 --> 00:31:02,50
SOMEONE looks down then back at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS207
00:31:01,00 --> 00:31:06,50
SOMEONE remains standing with his arms at his sides. 

HUGO_DVS208
00:31:12,00 --> 00:31:18,50
SOMEONE sets down a cup of small hand tools then folds his arms. 

HUGO_DVS209
00:31:18,00 --> 00:31:26,50
Stepping forward, SOMEONE picks up a screwdriver and adjusts the toy's wind-up mechanism. 

HUGO_DVS210
00:31:33,00 --> 00:31:40,50
He takes off the toy' outer shell and uses a small hammer to pound it back into shape. 

HUGO_DVS212
00:31:42,00 --> 00:31:47,50
He snaps the shell back onto the mechanism, 

HUGO_DVS213
00:31:45,00 --> 00:31:52,50
tightens it on with screws, then places the repaired mouse back onto the counter. 

HUGO_DVS214
00:31:50,00 --> 00:31:56,50
SOMEONE picks up the mouse, inserts a key, and winds it up. 

HUGO_DVS215
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:10,50
The mouse scuttles over the counter in a figure-eight, rears up on a spring and peers at SOMEONE, forms another figure-eight, and peers at SOMEONE, 

HUGO_DVS216
00:32:07,00 --> 00:32:11,50
then falls still. 

HUGO_DVS217
00:32:48,00 --> 00:32:53,50
SOMEONE waves his hand dismissively. 

HUGO_DVS218
00:32:52,00 --> 00:32:57,50
SOMEONE walks into the shop, then reaches for a broom. 

HUGO_DVS219
00:33:03,00 --> 00:33:10,50
In the cafe, a musician with a pencil-thin moustache strums a guitar in front of the band. 

HUGO_DVS220
00:33:08,00 --> 00:33:14,50
People dance or tap their toes as clouds of cigarette smoke fill the air. 

HUGO_DVS221
00:33:12,00 --> 00:33:17,50
In the toy store, SOMEONE squirts oil onto a model house. 

HUGO_DVS222
00:33:15,00 --> 00:33:19,50
People are dancing. 

HUGO_DVS223
00:33:16,00 --> 00:33:22,50
He glances up at SOMEONE, who holds a deck of playing cards topped by the eight of spades. 

HUGO_DVS224
00:33:20,00 --> 00:33:26,50
As he waves one hand, the eight of diamonds rises from the middle of the deck. 

HUGO_DVS225
00:33:23,00 --> 00:33:29,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE, who quickly returns to his work. 

HUGO_DVS226
00:33:27,00 --> 00:33:33,50
SOMEONE shuffles the cards as he stares at the boy. 

HUGO_DVS227
00:33:30,00 --> 00:33:36,50
Later, he demonstrates how to fan out a deck of cards. 

HUGO_DVS228
00:33:38,00 --> 00:33:45,50
SOMEONE attempts it with a deck of his own but fumbles and drops the cards. 

HUGO_DVS229
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:56,50
Alone in the attic, kneeling across from the automaton, SOMEONE waves one hand over a deck of cards. 

HUGO_DVS230
00:33:53,00 --> 00:33:58,50
The king of hearts card floats up into his hand. 

HUGO_DVS231
00:33:56,00 --> 00:34:00,50
He presents it to the automaton. 

HUGO_DVS232
00:34:00,00 --> 00:34:04,50
SOMEONE grins. 

HUGO_DVS233
00:34:05,00 --> 00:34:11,50
In the shop, he paints coat buttons onto a tin soldier. 

HUGO_DVS234
00:34:09,00 --> 00:34:15,50
In the steamy attic, he reattaches the automatons left arm. 

HUGO_DVS235
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:21,50
In the shop, SOMEONE looks up from his work at SOMEONE, who demonstrates dance steps for a group of girls. 

HUGO_DVS236
00:34:19,00 --> 00:34:25,50
In the attic, he pushes a mechanism's gear with his thumb, spinning a tiny propeller. 

HUGO_DVS237
00:34:23,00 --> 00:34:32,50
In the main station, SOMEONE stares at her feet as she dances with another girl. She looks up and smiles at SOMEONE, who gasps and turns away. 

HUGO_DVS238
00:34:30,00 --> 00:34:38,50
In the attic, SOMEONE inserts the repaired mechanism into the automaton's chest cavity and locks it into place. 

HUGO_DVS239
00:34:36,00 --> 00:34:44,50
Later, the reassembled automaton sits at the small table with a sheet of blank paper and a pen in its right hand. 

HUGO_DVS241
00:34:50,00 --> 00:34:55,50
SOMEONE winds a crank on the automaton's back. 

HUGO_DVS243
00:34:58,00 --> 00:35:04,50
Smiling, SOMEONE leaps in front of the automaton and watches. 

HUGO_DVS244
00:35:01,00 --> 00:35:08,50
A few more gears within the complicated mechanism begin to spin. 

HUGO_DVS245
00:35:07,00 --> 00:35:12,50
The automaton sits motionless. 

HUGO_DVS246
00:35:09,00 --> 00:35:14,50
The pen in its hand never moving. 

HUGO_DVS247
00:35:14,00 --> 00:35:18,50
SOMEONE's smile fades. 

HUGO_DVS248
00:35:16,00 --> 00:35:23,50
He steps forward and lightly shoves the automaton, then flicks the tiny propeller. 

HUGO_DVS249
00:35:22,00 --> 00:35:27,50
He forces it to turn, but still nothing happens. 

HUGO_DVS250
00:35:24,00 --> 00:35:32,50
SOMEONE walks to the back of the automaton and rubs one finger over the heart shaped keyhole. 

HUGO_DVS251
00:35:39,00 --> 00:35:45,50
SOMEONE pulls off a thin metal rod and drops it onto his worktable. 

HUGO_DVS252
00:35:44,00 --> 00:35:52,50
In the train station, a dirty boy with ratty hair and clothing glances at SOMEONE as he strolls past the toyshop. 

HUGO_DVS253
00:35:56,00 --> 00:36:03,50
Holding his dog on a leash, the station inspector stares intently at the boy as he follows him. 

HUGO_DVS254
00:36:01,00 --> 00:36:07,50
SOMEONE ducks behind the toyshop counter until they pass. 

HUGO_DVS255
00:36:04,00 --> 00:36:12,50
A businessman reading a newspaper vacates a bench, leaving behind a crumpled paper bag. 

HUGO_DVS256
00:36:10,00 --> 00:36:17,50
The unwashed boy examines the contents of the bag then peers into an empty glass bottle. 

HUGO_DVS257
00:36:14,00 --> 00:36:19,50
The station inspector steps up to him. 

HUGO_DVS258
00:36:25,00 --> 00:36:32,50
The boy tries to run but the dog blocks his retreat. The inspector whips the leash around the boy's ankle. 

HUGO_DVS259
00:37:12,00 --> 00:37:17,50
The boy now stands in a cage in the inspector's office. 

HUGO_DVS260
00:37:33,00 --> 00:37:38,50
SOMEONE peers down from a wall clock. 

HUGO_DVS261
00:37:46,00 --> 00:37:51,50
SOMEONE watches the boy being lead to a policeman's paddy wagon. 

HUGO_DVS262
00:37:57,00 --> 00:38:03,50
The boy struggles but they toss him into the wagon with a group of other orphans. 

HUGO_DVS263
00:38:18,00 --> 00:38:23,50
The policeman gives the inspector a photo. 

HUGO_DVS264
00:38:24,00 --> 00:38:30,50
SOMEONE scurries to another vent and watches SOMEONE give dance lessons. 

HUGO_DVS265
00:38:35,00 --> 00:38:41,50
Later, SOMEONE explores the bookstore with SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS266
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:24,50
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE then smiles and takes his hand as they walk around a giant stack of books. 

HUGO_DVS267
00:39:36,00 --> 00:39:40,50
SOMEONE grins. 

HUGO_DVS268
00:39:37,00 --> 00:39:42,50
SOMEONE smiles back. 

HUGO_DVS269
00:39:45,00 --> 00:39:52,50
Later, they stand in a street gazing up at a glowing theatre sign - Le Cinema. 

HUGO_DVS270
00:39:50,00 --> 00:39:56,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE then jerks his head to one side. 

HUGO_DVS271
00:39:53,00 --> 00:39:59,50
They tiptoe around the corner together to a side entrance. 

HUGO_DVS272
00:39:56,00 --> 00:40:02,50
Taking out a set of small tools, SOMEONE picks the lock. 

HUGO_DVS273
00:40:11,00 --> 00:40:18,50
He opens the door. Inside the darkened theatre, SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit together. 

HUGO_DVS274
00:40:15,00 --> 00:40:22,50
On the movie screen, Harold SOMEONE dangles from the side of a building by his fingertips. 

HUGO_DVS275
00:40:20,00 --> 00:40:26,50
He regains his footing and climbs up the corner of the building. 

HUGO_DVS276
00:40:28,00 --> 00:40:34,50
SOMEONE glances sideways at SOMEONE and smiles. 

HUGO_DVS277
00:40:31,00 --> 00:40:37,50
As SOMEONE slips, SOMEONE gasps and grabs SOMEONE's arm. 

HUGO_DVS278
00:40:35,00 --> 00:40:39,50
SOMEONE stands on a window ledge. 

HUGO_DVS279
00:40:37,00 --> 00:40:45,50
In an apartment, a man swings out the bottom of his window, forcing SOMEONE to grab onto the hands of a nearby clock. 

HUGO_DVS280
00:40:42,00 --> 00:40:47,50
The clock face starts to detach from the building. 

HUGO_DVS281
00:40:45,00 --> 00:40:51,50
SOMEONE's legs kick wildly as he hangs by only a few springs. 

HUGO_DVS282
00:40:50,00 --> 00:40:56,50
A mustached man sneaks up behind SOMEONE and SOMEONE and grabs their shoulders. 

HUGO_DVS283
00:41:00,00 --> 00:41:06,50
He wrestles them out of their seats and marches them out of the front door. 

HUGO_DVS284
00:41:08,00 --> 00:41:13,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE flee up a sidewalk. 

HUGO_DVS285
00:42:25,00 --> 00:42:30,50
Standing on a bridge, SOMEONE stares at her. 

HUGO_DVS286
00:42:33,00 --> 00:42:39,50
He takes a step forward then turns and points into the distance. 

HUGO_DVS287
00:42:39,00 --> 00:42:46,50
The train station's clock tower rises on the other side of the river. 

HUGO_DVS288
00:42:44,00 --> 00:42:48,50
They walk into the station. 

HUGO_DVS289
00:43:00,00 --> 00:43:05,50
Brow furrowed the station inspector strides toward them. 

HUGO_DVS290
00:43:12,00 --> 00:43:18,50
SOMEONE takes off SOMEONE's beret and places it over his own head. 

HUGO_DVS291
00:43:22,00 --> 00:43:28,50
The station inspector passes them then pauses and turns. 

HUGO_DVS292
00:43:28,00 --> 00:43:33,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE freeze. 

HUGO_DVS293
00:43:31,00 --> 00:43:37,50
SOMEONE starts to slide away but SOMEONE grabs the hem of his coat. 

HUGO_DVS294
00:43:49,00 --> 00:43:54,50
The station inspector frowns at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS295
00:43:53,00 --> 00:43:58,50
His dog sniffs SOMEONE's leg. 

HUGO_DVS296
00:45:42,00 --> 00:45:48,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk off together then glance over their shoulders. 

HUGO_DVS297
00:45:45,00 --> 00:45:54,50
Across the station, the inspector climbs a series of pegs sticking out of a wall, using only his hands. 

HUGO_DVS298
00:46:08,00 --> 00:46:14,50
SOMEONE glances over his shoulder then gives SOMEONE her beret back. 

HUGO_DVS299
00:46:17,00 --> 00:46:21,50
SOMEONE follows SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS300
00:46:33,00 --> 00:46:39,50
SOMEONE shoves his way through a crowd of people walking in the opposite direction. 

HUGO_DVS301
00:46:36,00 --> 00:46:42,50
SOMEONE pushes her way through the crowd after him. 

HUGO_DVS302
00:46:44,00 --> 00:46:47,50
SOMEONE falls. 

HUGO_DVS303
00:46:45,00 --> 00:46:51,50
She curls up and covers her head as people step over and around her. 

HUGO_DVS304
00:46:56,00 --> 00:47:02,50
SOMEONE turns and fights his way back to SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS305
00:47:03,00 --> 00:47:08,50
Reaching out his hand, he pulls her up off the floor. 

HUGO_DVS306
00:47:08,00 --> 00:47:12,50
They smile at one another. 

HUGO_DVS307
00:47:09,00 --> 00:47:14,50
SOMEONE's mouth drops open. 

HUGO_DVS308
00:47:11,00 --> 00:47:17,50
A heart-shaped key dangles from a cord around SOMEONE's neck. 

HUGO_DVS309
00:47:28,00 --> 00:47:33,50
SOMEONE stares into SOMEONE's eyes. 

HUGO_DVS310
00:47:36,00 --> 00:47:43,50
SOMEONE leads her through a back corridor filled with steam and dripping pipes. 

HUGO_DVS311
00:47:50,00 --> 00:47:54,50
They step into SOMEONE's attic workshop. 

HUGO_DVS312
00:47:52,00 --> 00:47:57,50
SOMEONE twirls as she gazes around herself. 

HUGO_DVS313
00:48:02,00 --> 00:48:07,50
SOMEONE yanks the sheet off the automaton. 

HUGO_DVS314
00:48:20,00 --> 00:48:26,50
SOMEONE peers closely at the automaton then strokes its metal face. 

HUGO_DVS315
00:49:06,00 --> 00:49:11,50
SOMEONE takes off the key from around her neck 

HUGO_DVS316
00:49:09,00 --> 00:49:13,50
and hands it to SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS317
00:49:16,00 --> 00:49:20,50
He looks down at it. 

HUGO_DVS318
00:49:39,00 --> 00:49:45,50
They stare at one another then both face the automaton. 

HUGO_DVS319
00:49:47,00 --> 00:49:54,50
SOMEONE walks behind it and turns the crank attached to its back. 

HUGO_DVS320
00:49:51,00 --> 00:49:56,50
He inserts the heart-shaped key into the lock. 

HUGO_DVS321
00:49:54,00 --> 00:49:58,50
It fits perfectly. 

HUGO_DVS322
00:49:57,00 --> 00:50:03,50
He turns the key, steps back beside SOMEONE, and smiles at her. 

HUGO_DVS323
00:50:08,00 --> 00:50:15,50
Gears and sprockets inside the automaton's chest whirr to life. 

HUGO_DVS324
00:50:16,00 --> 00:50:23,50
A tumbler of notched plates rotates into a new configuration then drops slightly. 

HUGO_DVS325
00:50:23,00 --> 00:50:34,50
The teeth of gears mesh together and power various parts of the mechanism. Tiny hammers rise and fall as a patterned cylinder rotates under them. 

HUGO_DVS327
00:50:35,00 --> 00:50:43,50
Holding a pen above a blank page, The automaton's right arm moves slightly then stops. 

HUGO_DVS328
00:50:41,00 --> 00:50:45,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

HUGO_DVS329
00:50:43,00 --> 00:50:49,50
He smiles again as the automaton slides its hand across the desk 

HUGO_DVS330
00:50:46,00 --> 00:50:51,50
and dips the pen into an ink well. 

HUGO_DVS331
00:50:58,00 --> 00:51:02,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE lean forward. 

HUGO_DVS332
00:51:00,00 --> 00:51:08,50
The automaton moves its hand across the length of the page then makes a small SOMEONE, resembling the letter "J." 

HUGO_DVS333
00:51:08,00 --> 00:51:14,50
The automaton's head moves up and down and side to side as it writes. 

HUGO_DVS334
00:51:12,00 --> 00:51:16,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE smile at one another. 

HUGO_DVS336
00:51:19,00 --> 00:51:26,50
The automaton moves its hand and makes another scribble, then another, seemingly at random. 

HUGO_DVS337
00:51:24,00 --> 00:51:30,50
SOMEONE furrows her brow and cocks her head to one side. 

HUGO_DVS338
00:51:32,00 --> 00:51:38,50
SOMEONE sidles beside the automaton and tilts his head. 

HUGO_DVS339
00:51:38,00 --> 00:51:45,50
The automaton writes a character resembling a half-formed letter "B" 

HUGO_DVS340
00:51:43,00 --> 00:51:48,50
then draws a series of short diagonal lines. 

HUGO_DVS341
00:51:50,00 --> 00:51:56,50
The automaton's head droops as it winds down to a stop. 

HUGO_DVS342
00:52:00,00 --> 00:52:06,50
SOMEONE stares at the illegible characters then pushes himself away from the table. 

HUGO_DVS343
00:52:04,00 --> 00:52:10,50
SOMEONE wrings her hands as she watches SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS344
00:52:32,00 --> 00:52:38,50
SOMEONE punches a stuffed chair then drops into it and sobs. 

HUGO_DVS345
00:52:36,00 --> 00:52:40,50
SOMEONE kneels beside him. 

HUGO_DVS346
00:53:16,00 --> 00:53:23,50
They rush back to the table as the automaton begins writing again. 

HUGO_DVS347
00:53:20,00 --> 00:53:27,50
Moving its hand, it begins connecting the various shapes and scribbles together with lines. 

HUGO_DVS348
00:53:32,00 --> 00:53:36,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

HUGO_DVS349
00:53:33,00 --> 00:53:39,50
He and SOMEONE step on either side of the automaton to get a better view. 

HUGO_DVS350
00:53:39,00 --> 00:53:46,50
The automaton draws a five-pointed star then a series of curved lines. 

HUGO_DVS351
00:53:46,00 --> 00:53:52,50
Its metal hands move quicker and quicker across the page. 

HUGO_DVS352
00:53:49,00 --> 00:53:56,50
It draws circles within circles and a series of overlapping checkmarks. 

HUGO_DVS353
00:53:53,00 --> 00:53:58,50
The automaton completes the drawing 

HUGO_DVS354
00:53:55,00 --> 00:54:00,50
and withdraws its hand. 

HUGO_DVS355
00:53:57,00 --> 00:54:04,50
On the page, a sketch of a rocket ship striking one eye of the Man in the Moon. 

HUGO_DVS356
00:54:05,00 --> 00:54:10,50
SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE and smiles. 

HUGO_DVS357
00:54:16,00 --> 00:54:23,50
The automaton reaches out its hand and signs a name in cursive at the bottom of the page. 

HUGO_DVS359
00:54:43,00 --> 00:54:49,50
The automaton's head returns to its normal posing as it stops. 

HUGO_DVS360
00:55:10,00 --> 00:55:15,50
SOMEONE picks up the drawing and stares at it. 

HUGO_DVS361
00:55:15,00 --> 00:55:21,50
He glances sideways at the automaton and grins. 

HUGO_DVS362
00:55:37,00 --> 00:55:46,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE step through the cemetery then through an iron gate. SOMEONE gazes up at SOMEONE's flat as she unlocks the front door. 

HUGO_DVS363
00:55:47,00 --> 00:55:53,50
SOMEONE holds the door open as SOMEONE steps inside. 

HUGO_DVS364
00:55:52,00 --> 00:55:57,50
SOMEONE steps down a hallway then turns into a sitting room. 

HUGO_DVS365
00:55:59,00 --> 00:56:04,50
SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE, who sits and sews. 

HUGO_DVS366
00:56:03,00 --> 00:56:07,50
SOMEONE stands as SOMEONE steps into the room. 

HUGO_DVS367
00:56:06,00 --> 00:56:12,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE then drops her sewing onto a chair. 

HUGO_DVS368
00:56:16,00 --> 00:56:21,50
SOMEONE steps toward SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS369
00:56:18,00 --> 00:56:23,50
She inspects him intently then turns to SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS370
00:56:31,00 --> 00:56:38,50
They look at SOMEONE, who pulls a folded piece of paper from an inner-jacket pocket. 

HUGO_DVS371
00:56:36,00 --> 00:56:41,50
He partially unfolds the paper then holds it out to SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS372
00:56:39,00 --> 00:56:46,50
She opens it and gazes down at the drawing of the rocket striking the eye of the Man in the Moon. 

HUGO_DVS373
00:56:49,00 --> 00:56:55,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE then looks back at the drawing. 

HUGO_DVS374
00:56:57,00 --> 00:57:02,50
Still staring at the drawing, SOMEONE slowly sits. 

HUGO_DVS375
00:57:00,00 --> 00:57:07,50
She glances at SOMEONE then back at the drawing, while raising one hand to her mouth. 

HUGO_DVS376
00:57:33,00 --> 00:57:39,50
SOMEONE raises her hand toward her own neck then looks at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS377
00:57:38,00 --> 00:57:43,50
SOMEONE removes the key from around her own neck. 

HUGO_DVS378
00:57:47,00 --> 00:57:51,50
SOMEONE holds up the drawing then stands. 

HUGO_DVS379
00:57:52,00 --> 00:57:56,50
SOMEONE takes the drawing. 

HUGO_DVS380
00:58:08,00 --> 00:58:12,50
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS381
00:58:14,00 --> 00:58:19,50
She places her hand on the side of his head. 

HUGO_DVS382
00:58:18,00 --> 00:58:24,50
SOMEONE withdraws her hand. She opens the door then immediately closes it. 

HUGO_DVS383
00:58:26,00 --> 00:58:32,50
SOMEONE turns SOMEONE and SOMEONE around then herds them into another room. 

HUGO_DVS384
00:58:33,00 --> 00:58:38,50
SOMEONE pulls the door almost shut but immediately opens it. 

HUGO_DVS385
00:58:37,00 --> 00:58:41,50
She shuts the door. 

HUGO_DVS386
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:44,50
SOMEONE turns and eyes an armoire standing against a wall. 

HUGO_DVS387
00:58:54,00 --> 00:59:01,50
SOMEONE opens the armoire as SOMEONE places her ear against the door. 

HUGO_DVS388
00:59:01,00 --> 00:59:09,50
SOMEONE searches through stacks of towels, while SOMEONE helps SOMEONE take off his coat in the next room. 

HUGO_DVS389
00:59:07,00 --> 00:59:12,50
SOMEONE crouches and peeks through a keyhole. 

HUGO_DVS390
00:59:09,00 --> 00:59:15,50
SOMEONE searches a container then shuts a drawer in the armoire. 

HUGO_DVS391
00:59:17,00 --> 00:59:22,50
SOMEONE looks up at SOMEONE as she turns her gaze toward the hallway. 

HUGO_DVS392
00:59:20,00 --> 00:59:28,50
SOMEONE closes the armoire, steps back, then peers at a small panel near the top which juts out slightly. 

HUGO_DVS393
00:59:33,00 --> 00:59:37,50
He points toward the panel. 

HUGO_DVS394
00:59:43,00 --> 00:59:49,50
SOMEONE sets a chair in front of the armoire and begins to climb onto it. 

HUGO_DVS395
00:59:47,00 --> 00:59:52,50
SOMEONE steps onto the chair then inspects the panel. 

HUGO_DVS396
00:59:50,00 --> 00:59:55,50
In the next room, SOMEONE glances toward the hallway. 

HUGO_DVS397
00:59:52,00 --> 00:59:57,50
SOMEONE presses the panel flush 

HUGO_DVS398
00:59:54,00 --> 00:59:59,50
then turns and smiles at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS399
01:00:01,00 --> 01:00:06,50
SOMEONE raps lightly on the wood. 

HUGO_DVS400
01:00:05,00 --> 01:00:13,50
SOMEONE smiles. SOMEONE glances behind herself then reaches up with both hands and removes the panel. 

HUGO_DVS401
01:00:16,00 --> 01:00:23,50
Smiling, she hands the panel to SOMEONE then turns toward a wooden box sitting in the exposed space. 

HUGO_DVS402
01:00:21,00 --> 01:00:26,50
SOMEONE grabs the box with both hands and pulls it forward. 

HUGO_DVS403
01:00:24,00 --> 01:00:28,50
The chair teeters under her. 

HUGO_DVS404
01:00:28,00 --> 01:00:35,50
SOMEONE glances over her shoulder then drags the box forward several inches. 

HUGO_DVS405
01:00:32,00 --> 01:00:39,50
Suddenly, the box falls but SOMEONE holds on, hugging it to her chest. 

HUGO_DVS406
01:00:40,00 --> 01:00:45,50
Wide-eyed, SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE turns toward him. 

HUGO_DVS407
01:00:44,00 --> 01:00:48,50
They smile. 

HUGO_DVS408
01:00:48,00 --> 01:00:53,50
The chair's legs snap and collapse. 

HUGO_DVS409
01:00:53,00 --> 01:00:58,50
The box falls to the floor and springs open. 

HUGO_DVS410
01:00:55,00 --> 01:01:00,50
Papers fly out and swirl around the room. 

HUGO_DVS411
01:00:57,00 --> 01:01:05,50
A sketch of a disembodied face floats past then another of a man peeking out from a ringed planet. 

HUGO_DVS412
01:01:03,00 --> 01:01:11,50
Several drawings of a dragon peel away in sequence. The flipping pages become an animation of the dragon breathing fire. 

HUGO_DVS413
01:01:09,00 --> 01:01:15,50
Sketches twist and twirl as they sail about the room. 

HUGO_DVS414
01:01:12,00 --> 01:01:19,50
SOMEONE's mouth opens as a drawing of the rocket crashing into the Man in the Moon drifts past. 

HUGO_DVS416
01:01:21,00 --> 01:01:28,50
As the drawings float to the floor, SOMEONE glares in from the doorway, SOMEONE stands behind him. 

HUGO_DVS417
01:01:26,00 --> 01:01:32,50
SOMEONE steps closer to SOMEONE, who licks his lips and swallows. 

HUGO_DVS418
01:01:29,00 --> 01:01:34,50
SOMEONE gazes around the room then steps inside. 

HUGO_DVS419
01:01:32,00 --> 01:01:36,50
Drawings litter the floor. 

HUGO_DVS420
01:01:37,00 --> 01:01:42,50
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE, who shakes her head. 

HUGO_DVS421
01:01:39,00 --> 01:01:45,50
SOMEONE scoops up several drawings with both hands. 

HUGO_DVS422
01:01:42,00 --> 01:01:47,50
He stares at SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS423
01:01:54,00 --> 01:02:01,50
SOMEONE furiously crumples the drawings as SOMEONE tries to grab his hands. 

HUGO_DVS424
01:02:10,00 --> 01:02:14,50
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS425
01:02:22,00 --> 01:02:28,50
SOMEONE sits on a bed. SOMEONE grasps his arm then sits next to him. 

HUGO_DVS426
01:02:29,00 --> 01:02:34,50
SOMEONE shakes his head and shrugs. 

HUGO_DVS427
01:02:34,00 --> 01:02:39,50
SOMEONE blinks back tears. 

HUGO_DVS428
01:02:36,00 --> 01:02:44,50
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE as he draws a deep breath then drops his head and covers his face with his hand. 

HUGO_DVS429
01:02:42,00 --> 01:02:49,50
SOMEONE wraps her arm around SOMEONE's shoulder as he gently sobs. 

HUGO_DVS430
01:02:46,00 --> 01:02:56,50
SOMEONE turns toward SOMEONE, nods, then they both walk out of the room, gazing over their shoulders at SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS431
01:03:00,00 --> 01:03:08,50
At the front door, SOMEONE stands on the landing as SOMEONE faces him from the doorway. 

HUGO_DVS432
01:03:07,00 --> 01:03:12,50
SOMEONE nods slightly as he meets SOMEONE's gaze. 

HUGO_DVS433
01:03:11,00 --> 01:03:15,50
They peer into each other's eyes. 

HUGO_DVS434
01:03:13,00 --> 01:03:17,50
SOMEONE looks downward. 

HUGO_DVS435
01:03:15,00 --> 01:03:20,50
SOMEONE grasps her hand then turns and walks off. 

HUGO_DVS436
01:03:34,00 --> 01:03:40,50
Facing SOMEONE, SOMEONE nods then turns and walks away. 

HUGO_DVS437
01:03:43,00 --> 01:03:49,50
Later, he crosses a cobble-stoned street near a statue of a lion. 

HUGO_DVS438
01:03:50,00 --> 01:03:57,50
He pushes open a door to the train station, steps inside, then collides with the bookseller. 

HUGO_DVS439
01:03:56,00 --> 01:04:00,50
He drops several books. 

HUGO_DVS440
01:03:59,00 --> 01:04:06,50
Crouching, SOMEONE quickly picks up the books then stands and faces the bearded bookseller. 

HUGO_DVS441
01:04:03,00 --> 01:04:08,50
SOMEONE runs his hand across the cover of the top book. 

HUGO_DVS442
01:04:06,00 --> 01:04:09,50
SOMEONE Hood. 

HUGO_DVS443
01:04:14,00 --> 01:04:18,50
SOMEONE returns the books. 

HUGO_DVS444
01:04:24,00 --> 01:04:28,50
SOMEONE stares at the floor. 

HUGO_DVS445
01:04:35,00 --> 01:04:42,50
SOMEONE smiles as the bookseller hands him the thick volume then walks off. 

HUGO_DVS446
01:04:40,00 --> 01:04:46,50
Holding the book in both hands, SOMEONE walks deeper into the station. 

HUGO_DVS447
01:04:44,00 --> 01:04:50,50
Outside the cafe, the station inspector sips from a cup. 

HUGO_DVS448
01:04:48,00 --> 01:04:54,50
SOMEONE freezes then turns and walks in the opposite direction. 

HUGO_DVS449
01:04:58,00 --> 01:05:02,50
The inspector stares at the flower seller. 

HUGO_DVS450
01:05:16,00 --> 01:05:20,50
He turns to the brown-haired cafe owner. 

HUGO_DVS451
01:05:21,00 --> 01:05:25,50
The inspector smiles weakly. 

HUGO_DVS452
01:05:29,00 --> 01:05:34,50
He raises his eyebrows and bares his teeth. 

HUGO_DVS453
01:05:38,00 --> 01:05:43,50
A curly-haired woman walks up with a tray. 

HUGO_DVS454
01:05:42,00 --> 01:05:47,50
She hands the inspector a new cup and saucer. 

HUGO_DVS455
01:05:45,00 --> 01:05:52,50
Still smiling, he steps forward then glances down at the two cups in his hands. 

HUGO_DVS456
01:05:50,00 --> 01:05:58,50
He returns them to the brown-haired woman then approaches the flower seller, who arranges bouquets for display. 

HUGO_DVS457
01:06:42,00 --> 01:06:47,50
He waves his hands in front of himself. 

HUGO_DVS458
01:07:09,00 --> 01:07:15,50
The inspector bends over a large bouquet of blue flowers. 

HUGO_DVS459
01:07:17,00 --> 01:07:24,50
He lurches forward, SOMEONE gasps and turns away. 

HUGO_DVS460
01:07:21,00 --> 01:07:27,50
The inspector adjusts his leg brace then glances at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS461
01:07:25,00 --> 01:07:30,50
Standing, he gazes at the floor, his shoulders hunched. 

HUGO_DVS462
01:07:28,00 --> 01:07:33,50
The inspector straightens then faces SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS463
01:07:36,00 --> 01:07:42,50
The inspector bows slightly then turns and walks off. 

HUGO_DVS464
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:46,50
He stops and glances back. 

HUGO_DVS465
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:55,50
The inspector turns toward SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS466
01:07:54,00 --> 01:08:05,50
She smiles at him then snaps off the tops of a handful of posies. SOMEONE slides one of the flowers beneath a silver button of the inspector's jacket. 

HUGO_DVS467
01:08:13,00 --> 01:08:18,50
He smiles at the flower then nods to SOMEONE. He touches the brim of his cap. 

HUGO_DVS468
01:08:19,00 --> 01:08:26,50
Then he turns and walks off. SOMEONE glances over her shoulder at him as she returns to her work. 

HUGO_DVS470
01:08:29,00 --> 01:08:38,50
Elsewhere, in a cavernous library lined with long tables and reading lamps, sunlight filters in through tall arched windows. 

HUGO_DVS471
01:08:59,00 --> 01:09:06,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE inspect book titles as they stroll past shelves. 

HUGO_DVS472
01:09:06,00 --> 01:09:12,50
SOMEONE pulls a tall, thick book from a shelf. 

HUGO_DVS473
01:09:12,00 --> 01:09:17,50
SOMEONE sets the volume onto a table. 

HUGO_DVS474
01:09:17,00 --> 01:09:22,50
He and SOMEONE gaze at the book's cover. 

HUGO_DVS475
01:09:20,00 --> 01:09:24,50
SOMEONE opens it. 

HUGO_DVS476
01:09:21,00 --> 01:09:26,50
A photograph of a train. 

HUGO_DVS477
01:09:33,00 --> 01:09:40,50
In black and white footage, a train rolls into a station. People watching the movie duck or turn away. 

HUGO_DVS478
01:09:52,00 --> 01:09:59,50
SOMEONE gazes up at a mural of a celestial figure shooting wind from his finger. 

HUGO_DVS479
01:10:00,00 --> 01:10:10,50
Shafts of light shine from the man's finger then turn into a movie projector's diffused beam. A curtain parts in front of a movie screen. 

HUGO_DVS480
01:10:16,00 --> 01:10:27,50
Onscreen a mustached man kisses a woman. A cowboy points his revolver and fires. Crowds gather before an ancient temple of large columns and statues. 

HUGO_DVS481
01:10:27,00 --> 01:10:42,50
SOMEONE turns a page. Buster Keaton sits on the coupling rod of a locomotive's wheels. As the train moves forward, the rod lifts Keaton's body in a circular motion. On another page a woman ties a feathered headdress to her head. A man in evening dress stares at her. 

HUGO_DVS482
01:10:39,00 --> 01:10:56,50
The book's pages flip quickly. A woman in white leaps backwards. A cowboy turns his head. People watch a movie. SOMEONE looks up from a sleeping boy. As SOMEONE turns the book's pages, more movie images appear. On a final page a rocket sticks out of the Man in the Moon's eye. 

HUGO_DVS483
01:10:54,00 --> 01:10:58,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE exchange glances. 

HUGO_DVS484
01:11:30,00 --> 01:11:35,50
A bearded bespectacled man stand behind them. 

HUGO_DVS485
01:11:35,00 --> 01:11:41,50
The man raises his eyebrows as he stares down at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS486
01:11:43,00 --> 01:11:49,50
As SOMEONE and the man stare at each other, SOMEONE glances at the open book. 

HUGO_DVS487
01:11:47,00 --> 01:11:53,50
SOMEONE nudges SOMEONE and points to a photograph of the author. 

HUGO_DVS488
01:11:50,00 --> 01:11:54,50
Same man standing behind them. 

HUGO_DVS489
01:11:52,00 --> 01:11:56,50
SOMEONE's mouth opens. 

HUGO_DVS490
01:11:54,00 --> 01:11:58,50
She looks up at the man. 

HUGO_DVS491
01:12:02,00 --> 01:12:07,50
The man, Rene SOMEONE, 

HUGO_DVS492
01:12:04,00 --> 01:12:08,50
bends forward. 

HUGO_DVS493
01:12:25,00 --> 01:12:30,50
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS494
01:12:31,00 --> 01:12:34,50
SOMEONE nods. 

HUGO_DVS495
01:12:43,00 --> 01:12:47,50
SOMEONE looks around himself. 

HUGO_DVS496
01:12:47,00 --> 01:12:55,50
Elsewhere, two wooden doors swing open, revealing a large room filled with dark furniture and framed photographs. 

HUGO_DVS497
01:13:02,00 --> 01:13:06,50
An old photo. 

HUGO_DVS498
01:13:09,00 --> 01:13:13,50
SOMEONE holds up an old playbill. 

HUGO_DVS499
01:13:16,00 --> 01:13:21,50
A clock with a clear face. 

HUGO_DVS500
01:13:23,00 --> 01:13:28,50
SOMEONE touches a large movie camera. 

HUGO_DVS501
01:13:25,00 --> 01:13:30,50
Ina photograph, people wear elaborate costumes. 

HUGO_DVS502
01:13:37,00 --> 01:13:42,50
SOMEONE gazes at a photo of a bearded man. 

HUGO_DVS503
01:14:12,00 --> 01:14:17,50
A young boy in a tweed suit gapes. 

HUGO_DVS504
01:14:27,00 --> 01:14:33,50
Young SOMEONE and his brother step into a glass house. 

HUGO_DVS505
01:14:32,00 --> 01:14:40,50
Beyond slowly swimming fish, a mermaid with hair flowing over her shoulders carries a staff. 

HUGO_DVS506
01:14:38,00 --> 01:14:43,50
People dressed as lobsters march with tall spears. 

HUGO_DVS507
01:14:41,00 --> 01:14:47,50
They stop before three women sitting on a seashell throne. 

HUGO_DVS508
01:14:44,00 --> 01:14:49,50
Real lobsters float downward. 

HUGO_DVS509
01:14:46,00 --> 01:14:52,50
A stagehand wearing a cap drops lobsters into a tank. 

HUGO_DVS510
01:14:52,00 --> 01:15:03,50
SOMEONE and his brother walk past an actor putting on a lobster costume. Two men adjust a camera on a tripod. On set, the three women hold perfectly still as lobstermen rush around them. 

HUGO_DVS511
01:15:10,00 --> 01:15:18,50
Wearing a shiny breastplate, a young SOMEONE trots onto the set. A man slides a fake sword into his belt. 

HUGO_DVS512
01:15:15,00 --> 01:15:22,50
The young SOMEONE smiles at SOMEONE, who slips on a fake beard then gestures with his finger. 

HUGO_DVS513
01:15:20,00 --> 01:15:24,50
SOMEONE steps up to him. 

HUGO_DVS514
01:15:29,00 --> 01:15:33,50
SOMEONE puts on a plumed helmet. 

HUGO_DVS515
01:15:34,00 --> 01:15:38,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

HUGO_DVS516
01:15:35,00 --> 01:15:40,50
SOMEONE strides toward the other actors. 

HUGO_DVS517
01:15:45,00 --> 01:15:57,50
The mermaid carrying a staff strolls past the three women. Knights wearing helmets hold their arms out to a man with a long white beard holding a trident, who sits above the seashell throne. 

HUGO_DVS518
01:16:25,00 --> 01:16:31,50
SOMEONE slides open a drawer and takes out a film canister. 

HUGO_DVS519
01:16:47,00 --> 01:16:53,50
Back at the station, SOMEONE and SOMEONE climb down into the suspended clock. 

HUGO_DVS520
01:16:56,00 --> 01:17:01,50
SOMEONE adjusts a screw in a clock's mechanism. 

HUGO_DVS521
01:17:05,00 --> 01:17:10,50
Below, the inspector looks at the clock then checks his watch. 

HUGO_DVS522
01:17:17,00 --> 01:17:27,50
Bending toward the clock's gears, SOMEONE drops a wrench through an opening. It lands on the station floor, behind the inspector and SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS523
01:17:27,00 --> 01:17:33,50
The inspector turns and picks up the wrench then stares up at the clock. 

HUGO_DVS524
01:17:35,00 --> 01:17:40,50
SOMEONE holds one finger over his mouth. 

HUGO_DVS525
01:17:55,00 --> 01:17:59,50
He turns to SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS526
01:18:05,00 --> 01:18:09,50
The inspector walks off. 

HUGO_DVS527
01:18:06,00 --> 01:18:14,50
Smiling, SOMEONE climbs a ladder toward SOMEONE. Later she sits against a wall as SOMEONE rotates a large crank. 

HUGO_DVS529
01:18:13,00 --> 01:18:22,50
Inside another clock, SOMEONE adjusts a small pendulum. In another, he turns a gear as he checks his pocket watch. 

HUGO_DVS530
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:26,50
Below, the bookseller talks with a man wearing a cap. 

HUGO_DVS531
01:19:50,00 --> 01:19:55,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE gaze at each other. 

HUGO_DVS532
01:19:52,00 --> 01:19:56,50
She shrugs. 

HUGO_DVS533
01:19:59,00 --> 01:20:05,50
At night, lights stream along the streets and boulevards of Paris. 

HUGO_DVS534
01:20:02,00 --> 01:20:08,50
Inside the clock tower, SOMEONE and SOMEONE gaze down upon the city. 

HUGO_DVS535
01:20:11,00 --> 01:20:16,50
A full moon hangs above the Eiffel Tower. 

HUGO_DVS536
01:20:45,00 --> 01:20:52,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE gaze into each other's eyes. SOMEONE smiles slightly. 

HUGO_DVS537
01:20:50,00 --> 01:20:55,50
They hold hands as they look out over Paris. 

HUGO_DVS538
01:20:53,00 --> 01:20:58,50
Behind them, the clockwork's gears turn smoothly. 

HUGO_DVS539
01:20:56,00 --> 01:21:01,50
Later, SOMEONE pulls a metal grate over the front of his shop. 

HUGO_DVS540
01:20:59,00 --> 01:21:04,50
Steam floats through the empty train station. 

HUGO_DVS541
01:21:04,00 --> 01:21:09,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hide behind a kiosk. 

HUGO_DVS543
01:21:27,00 --> 01:21:31,50
SOMEONE nods then grins. 

HUGO_DVS544
01:21:28,00 --> 01:21:33,50
SOMEONE breaks into a broad smile. 

HUGO_DVS545
01:21:31,00 --> 01:21:36,50
She leans forward and kisses SOMEONE on the cheek 

HUGO_DVS546
01:21:33,00 --> 01:21:37,50
then walks off. 

HUGO_DVS547
01:21:38,00 --> 01:21:44,50
SOMEONE watches her walk past an empty bench towards SOMEONE 

HUGO_DVS548
01:21:41,00 --> 01:21:45,50
who trudges slowly along a wall. 

HUGO_DVS549
01:21:43,00 --> 01:21:50,50
SOMEONE stops and takes SOMEONE's briefcase from him. They walk arm-in-arm. 

HUGO_DVS550
01:21:52,00 --> 01:21:58,50
SOMEONE slowly backs up behind the kiosk as he watches them leave. 

HUGO_DVS551
01:21:57,00 --> 01:22:04,50
In the attic, he winds a pocket watch then hangs it from a post near his bed. 

HUGO_DVS552
01:22:02,00 --> 01:22:09,50
Wearing a nightgown, SOMEONE gazes at the automaton, which sits across the room from him. 

HUGO_DVS553
01:22:07,00 --> 01:22:12,50
Steam swirls around the motionless figure. 

HUGO_DVS554
01:22:09,00 --> 01:22:15,50
Lying down, SOMEONE stares at his watch, which reads five until ten. 

HUGO_DVS555
01:22:13,00 --> 01:22:19,50
Later, he lies on his back, his eyes still open. 

HUGO_DVS556
01:22:24,00 --> 01:22:30,50
Morning. People walk along train station platforms. 

HUGO_DVS557
01:22:27,00 --> 01:22:34,50
SOMEONE steals an apple from a passing cart and slips it into his pocket. 

HUGO_DVS558
01:22:31,00 --> 01:22:38,50
SOMEONE glances toward the railroad track as he walks near the edge of the platform. 

HUGO_DVS559
01:22:35,00 --> 01:22:39,50
He slows then stops. 

HUGO_DVS560
01:22:39,00 --> 01:22:48,50
A key sticks out of the gravel next to a railroad tie. SOMEONE glances down the platform then creeps toward the edge. 

HUGO_DVS561
01:22:51,00 --> 01:23:00,50
Glancing in both directions, SOMEONE hops down to the tracks, steps over a rail, then crouches on a tie. 

HUGO_DVS562
01:23:04,00 --> 01:23:08,50
He picks up the key and examines it. 

HUGO_DVS563
01:23:06,00 --> 01:23:11,50
It resembles SOMEONE's key with a heart at each end. 

HUGO_DVS564
01:23:10,00 --> 01:23:14,50
SOMEONE turns the key in his hand. 

HUGO_DVS565
01:23:11,00 --> 01:23:16,50
Inscribed around one heart, 

HUGO_DVS566
01:23:13,00 --> 01:23:20,50
Cabret et Fils Horloge, or Cabret and Son Clock Makers. 

HUGO_DVS567
01:23:18,00 --> 01:23:24,50
One rail begins to vibrate. A train steams toward the station. 

HUGO_DVS568
01:23:22,00 --> 01:23:29,50
The train's engineer, wearing goggles and covered in soot, leans out of the engine car. 

HUGO_DVS569
01:23:38,00 --> 01:23:47,50
The engineer furiously turns a wheel then shoves a lever. SOMEONE stares at the key then looks around at the vibrating ground. 

HUGO_DVS570
01:23:45,00 --> 01:23:54,50
Black smoke pours from the train's stack. Sparks shoot from between the train's wheels. SOMEONE's eyes widen. 

HUGO_DVS571
01:23:52,00 --> 01:23:59,50
The train roars toward SOMEONE, who holds out one hand as he falls backward onto the tracks. 

HUGO_DVS573
01:23:59,00 --> 01:24:06,50
The engineer and stoker cover their faces. The train veers onto the platform and crashes through the station. 

HUGO_DVS574
01:24:04,00 --> 01:24:12,50
People flee as the locomotive plows through luggage and benches. Inside the cafe, customers duck as the windows blow out. 

HUGO_DVS576
01:24:11,00 --> 01:24:18,50
One man knocks another man out of the train's path as it crashes through a newsstand. 

HUGO_DVS577
01:24:16,00 --> 01:24:24,50
The runaway train smashes through the station's huge front windows and falls into the street one story below. 

HUGO_DVS580
01:24:25,00 --> 01:24:29,50
SOMEONE awakes and sits up in bed. 

HUGO_DVS581
01:24:28,00 --> 01:24:33,50
Sweating, he looks around himself. 

HUGO_DVS582
01:24:31,00 --> 01:24:36,50
The automaton's face is turned in his direction. 

HUGO_DVS583
01:24:44,00 --> 01:24:50,50
SOMEONE gazes toward the dangling strap that held his watch, 

HUGO_DVS584
01:24:47,00 --> 01:24:51,50
but the watch is gone. 

HUGO_DVS585
01:24:49,00 --> 01:24:53,50
The automaton stares at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS586
01:24:54,00 --> 01:25:01,50
SOMEONE glances around himself, feels his own chest, then unbuttons his shirt. 

HUGO_DVS587
01:25:05,00 --> 01:25:15,50
Pulling his shirt open with both hands, SOMEONE looks down at his torso, which is now a metallic framework filled with pistons and moving parts. 

HUGO_DVS588
01:25:13,00 --> 01:25:18,50
He stands quickly on mechanical legs. 

HUGO_DVS589
01:25:15,00 --> 01:25:21,50
SOMEONE glances up as the huge gears of a clock close in around him. 

HUGO_DVS590
01:25:22,00 --> 01:25:27,50
He holds his robotic hands to his face, 

HUGO_DVS591
01:25:24,00 --> 01:25:30,50
which turns into the automaton's face and then back to his own again. 

HUGO_DVS592
01:25:34,00 --> 01:25:42,50
Again, SOMEONE awakes and sits up in bed. His watch hangs from the strap where he left it. 

HUGO_DVS593
01:25:39,00 --> 01:25:45,50
Across the room, the automaton faces toward SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS594
01:25:45,00 --> 01:25:52,50
Sitting on his bed, staring back at the automaton, SOMEONE holds a small oil lamp. 

HUGO_DVS595
01:25:49,00 --> 01:25:55,50
Above him, a large gear slowly rotates. 

HUGO_DVS596
01:25:55,00 --> 01:26:04,50
Outside, a man lies on his back on a riverside. A gloved hand pushes open the man's coat revealing a flask in a vest pocket. 

HUGO_DVS597
01:26:02,00 --> 01:26:08,50
A policeman grabs the flask and turns it upside down. Engraved on the bottom, 

HUGO_DVS598
01:26:05,00 --> 01:26:10,50
"Claude Cabret, 1925." 

HUGO_DVS599
01:26:09,00 --> 01:26:17,50
The policeman holds out the flask to another policeman. In the station inspector's office, a phone rings. 

HUGO_DVS600
01:26:32,00 --> 01:26:40,50
Wearing leather gloves and long johns, the inspector soaks in a bathtub as he uses the phone. 

HUGO_DVS601
01:26:46,00 --> 01:26:52,50
The inspector hangs up the phone then stares intently at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS602
01:27:02,00 --> 01:27:09,50
SOMEONE's ears stand straight up as he stares at the inspector. 

HUGO_DVS603
01:27:10,00 --> 01:27:18,50
Standing in the cemetery beneath a statue of a hooded figure, SOMEONE checks his pocket watch. 

HUGO_DVS604
01:27:15,00 --> 01:27:22,50
He steps through the arched gate and crosses a narrow street, where he meets Rene SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS605
01:27:23,00 --> 01:27:28,50
SOMEONE steps up to SOMEONE front door. 

HUGO_DVS606
01:27:26,00 --> 01:27:31,50
Inside, SOMEONE sits with SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS607
01:27:29,00 --> 01:27:35,50
SOMEONE closes a large book, then walks down the hallway. 

HUGO_DVS608
01:27:32,00 --> 01:27:37,50
She opens the front door. 

HUGO_DVS609
01:27:39,00 --> 01:27:45,50
Carrying cases, SOMEONE and SOMEONE step inside. 

HUGO_DVS610
01:27:44,00 --> 01:27:49,50
SOMEONE looks from SOMEONE to the others. 

HUGO_DVS611
01:27:46,00 --> 01:27:50,50
SOMEONE removes his hat. 

HUGO_DVS612
01:27:53,00 --> 01:27:58,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE then at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS613
01:28:32,00 --> 01:28:36,50
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS614
01:28:44,00 --> 01:28:52,50
SOMEONE glances over her shoulder at her godmother. Smiling, SOMEONE steps up to SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS615
01:29:15,00 --> 01:29:21,50
SOMEONE's eyes glisten as she smiles and turns away. 

HUGO_DVS616
01:29:18,00 --> 01:29:22,50
SOMEONE dons his hat. 

HUGO_DVS617
01:29:57,00 --> 01:30:02,50
SOMEONE jerks her head. 

HUGO_DVS618
01:30:16,00 --> 01:30:21,50
SOMEONE glances over her shoulder at a closed door. 

HUGO_DVS619
01:30:24,00 --> 01:30:30,50
She leads them into the sitting room where SOMEONE sets up a projector. 

HUGO_DVS620
01:30:36,00 --> 01:30:42,50
The others sit as SOMEONE threads a film through the projector. 

HUGO_DVS621
01:30:42,00 --> 01:30:46,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

HUGO_DVS622
01:30:43,00 --> 01:30:48,50
SOMEONE pulls his chair closer to a screen. 

HUGO_DVS623
01:30:48,00 --> 01:30:53,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE then nods. 

HUGO_DVS624
01:30:53,00 --> 01:30:59,50
He smiles and turns a crank on his film projector as the lights dim. 

HUGO_DVS625
01:30:59,00 --> 01:31:05,50
Everyone smiles as a black and white movie flickers on a screen. 

HUGO_DVS626
01:31:05,00 --> 01:31:12,50
A group of female sailors push a bullet-shaped capsule into a giant cannon. 

HUGO_DVS627
01:31:10,00 --> 01:31:14,50
The women wave their sailor's caps. 

HUGO_DVS628
01:31:15,00 --> 01:31:21,50
SOMEONE holds one hand to her chest as she watches. 

HUGO_DVS629
01:31:18,00 --> 01:31:27,50
On screen, a military officer swings his sabre. A gunner lights a fuse on the cannon, which fires the capsule into outer space. 

HUGO_DVS630
01:31:24,00 --> 01:31:30,50
It lodges in the left eye of a man wearing a mask of the moon. 

HUGO_DVS631
01:31:34,00 --> 01:31:41,50
SOMEONE smiles. As the capsule lands on the moon's surface and people step out, the capsule turns red. 

HUGO_DVS632
01:31:48,00 --> 01:31:57,50
The people jump and wave as the distant Earth rises above the horizon. Later, as the explorers sleep on the moon's surface, 

HUGO_DVS633
01:31:54,00 --> 01:32:01,50
people appear in the sky. A bearded man peers out of the planet Saturn. 

HUGO_DVS634
01:31:58,00 --> 01:32:02,50
A woman sits on a crescent moon. 

HUGO_DVS635
01:32:03,00 --> 01:32:09,50
A young SOMEONE sits on the crescent moon as snow falls on the sleepers. 

HUGO_DVS636
01:32:09,00 --> 01:32:15,50
SOMEONE smiles and places one hand on SOMEONE's shoulder. 

HUGO_DVS637
01:32:12,00 --> 01:32:24,50
On screen, the explorers flee as an alien with a man's body and a lizard's head chases them. One man uses an umbrella to hit the alien, who vanishes in a puff of red smoke. 

HUGO_DVS638
01:32:21,00 --> 01:32:27,50
The explorers return to their capsule and huddle inside. 

HUGO_DVS639
01:32:24,00 --> 01:32:30,50
Another alien leaps onto it sending the capsule over a cliff. 

HUGO_DVS640
01:32:29,00 --> 01:32:34,50
It drops into the ocean and sinks to the bottom of the sea. 

HUGO_DVS641
01:32:31,00 --> 01:32:37,50
The explorers escape and swim back to the surface. 

HUGO_DVS642
01:32:39,00 --> 01:32:46,50
Later, people celebrate the explorers with a parade and a statue in their honor. 

HUGO_DVS643
01:32:46,00 --> 01:32:51,50
SOMEONE smiles as the film ends. 

HUGO_DVS644
01:32:48,00 --> 01:32:52,50
He stops turning the crank. 

HUGO_DVS645
01:32:50,00 --> 01:32:55,50
Tears well in SOMEONE's eyes. 

HUGO_DVS646
01:32:52,00 --> 01:32:58,50
SOMEONE sits with her mouth open then shakes her head and smiles. 

HUGO_DVS647
01:33:00,00 --> 01:33:05,50
Everyone turns toward SOMEONE 

HUGO_DVS648
01:33:02,00 --> 01:33:06,50
who stands in the doorway. 

HUGO_DVS649
01:33:06,00 --> 01:33:11,50
SOMEONE stands then walks to SOMEONE and takes his hand. 

HUGO_DVS650
01:33:12,00 --> 01:33:16,50
He steps into the room 

HUGO_DVS651
01:33:14,00 --> 01:33:18,50
and walks up to SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS652
01:33:27,00 --> 01:33:34,50
SOMEONE takes SOMEONE's other hand and the women lead him to a sofa. 

HUGO_DVS653
01:33:53,00 --> 01:33:58,50
SOMEONE raises SOMEONE's hands to his lips and kisses it. 

HUGO_DVS654
01:34:06,00 --> 01:34:10,50
SOMEONE nods. 

HUGO_DVS655
01:34:30,00 --> 01:34:38,50
SOMEONE's moustache and beard darken. As a younger man, he stands on a stage in a packed theatre. 

HUGO_DVS656
01:34:35,00 --> 01:34:42,50
SOMEONE floats horizontally above the stage with her elbow resting atop a thin pole.

SOMEONE and SOMEONE step into a tent 

HUGO_DVS662
01:35:59,00 --> 01:36:04,50
where a man cranks a movie projector. 

HUGO_DVS663
01:36:05,00 --> 01:36:11,50
SOMEONE's mouth drops open as he watches the screen. 

HUGO_DVS664
01:36:11,00 --> 01:36:17,50
The audience cowers as an oncoming train passes. 

HUGO_DVS665
01:36:14,00 --> 01:36:20,50
SOMEONE slides up to the projectionist and studies his contraption. 

HUGO_DVS666
01:36:59,00 --> 01:37:08,50

HUGO_DVS670
01:37:37,00 --> 01:37:42,50
A platform raises him up again. 

HUGO_DVS671
01:37:41,00 --> 01:37:47,50
SOMEONE brushes his face with powder. Later, actors wearing robes and 

HUGO_DVS672
01:37:45,00 --> 01:37:51,50
turbans march with spears and scimitars through a surrealistic ruin. 

HUGO_DVS673
01:37:48,00 --> 01:37:54,50
They retreat as a large dragon puppet slides onto the set. 

HUGO_DVS674
01:37:52,00 --> 01:37:57,50
Flames shoot from the dragon's nostrils. 

HUGO_DVS675
01:37:54,00 --> 01:37:58,50
Its head sags to the floor. 

HUGO_DVS676
01:38:06,00 --> 01:38:10,50
SOMEONE runs to the puppeteers.

HUGO_DVS678
01:38:20,00 --> 01:38:25,50
The dragon breathes smoke and fire. 

HUGO_DVS679
01:38:25,00 --> 01:38:30,50
Weapons raised, the actors creep across the set. 

HUGO_DVS680
01:38:27,00 --> 01:38:34,50
They hide behind a panel of scenery then retreat as men push the dragon puppet along on a track. 

HUGO_DVS681
01:38:32,00 --> 01:38:37,50
Flames leap from the dragon's nostrils. 

HUGO_DVS682
01:38:52,00 --> 01:38:57,50
The actors jab at the dragon with their prop weapons. 

HUGO_DVS683
01:38:55,00 --> 01:39:00,50
Later, they surround a group of dancers wearing skeleton costumes. 

HUGO_DVS684
01:39:03,00 --> 01:39:10,50
As the skeletons cartwheel and dance in place, the warriors raise their weapons. 

HUGO_DVS685
01:39:18,00 --> 01:39:23,50
The camera stops while the skeletons hurry off the set. 

HUGO_DVS686
01:39:21,00 --> 01:39:26,50
A man places a smoke bomb where they stood. 

HUGO_DVS687
01:39:24,00 --> 01:39:31,50

HUGO_DVS688
01:39:37,00 --> 01:39:46,50
In the edited movie, the skeletons appear to vanish in a puff of smoke as the warriors chop through them. Later SOMEONE poses SOMEONE on a movie set. 

HUGO_DVS689
01:39:54,00 --> 01:40:01,50
Sparks shoot in front of SOMEONE as she reclined in front of a painting of a shooting star. 

HUGO_DVS690
01:40:09,00 --> 01:40:17,50
Artillery explodes in a field. A cannon fires. SOMEONE throws pieces of set onto a bonfire. 

HUGO_DVS691
01:40:20,00 --> 01:40:27,50
In old film footage, soldiers run out of a trench onto a smoky battlefield. 

HUGO_DVS692
01:40:46,00 --> 01:40:51,50
A rain-soaked movie poster peels off a brick wall. 

HUGO_DVS693
01:41:08,00 --> 01:41:18,50

A woman wearing high-heeled shoes walks past SOMEONE's toyshop. 

HUGO_DVS696
01:42:30,00 --> 01:42:35,50
SOMEONE grins at SOMEONE then stands. 

HUGO_DVS697
01:42:37,00 --> 01:42:47,50
He runs out of the room. SOMEONE smiles broadly. Outside, SOMEONE pushes past pedestrians as he races toward the train station. 

HUGO_DVS698
01:42:47,00 --> 01:42:53,50
Inside, he grins as he strides through a sea of people. 

HUGO_DVS699
01:42:50,00 --> 01:43:00,50
Nearby, the news vendor carries a wicker basket toward the cafe where the owner sits outside with her small dog in her lap. 

HUGO_DVS700
01:43:10,00 --> 01:43:14,50
Frick sets down his basket. 

HUGO_DVS701
01:43:13,00 --> 01:43:18,50
A small brown dog peeks out of the basket. 

HUGO_DVS702
01:43:20,00 --> 01:43:24,50
The two dogs stare at one another. 

HUGO_DVS703
01:43:26,00 --> 01:43:31,50
The cafe owner sets her dog on the floor. 

HUGO_DVS704
01:43:32,00 --> 01:43:37,50
The two dogs wag their tails as they sniff one another. 

HUGO_DVS705
01:43:35,00 --> 01:43:41,50
He glances at the cafe owner who presses her hands over her heart. 

HUGO_DVS706
01:43:43,00 --> 01:43:48,50
Smiling, he steps forward and kisses her hands. 

HUGO_DVS707
01:43:46,00 --> 01:43:51,50
SOMEONE glances at them as he passes. 

HUGO_DVS708
01:43:50,00 --> 01:43:53,50
SOMEONE stops. 

HUGO_DVS709
01:43:51,00 --> 01:43:59,50
A few paces ahead, SOMEONE sits attentively beside the station inspector who checks a pocket watch. 

HUGO_DVS710
01:43:57,00 --> 01:44:05,50
SOMEONE dives under some nearby cafe tables as the inspector turns and approaches Frick and the cafe owner. 

HUGO_DVS711
01:44:51,00 --> 01:44:57,50
The dogs run over to SOMEONE who tries to shoo them away. 

HUGO_DVS712
01:45:01,00 --> 01:45:05,50
The inspector grabs SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS713
01:45:09,00 --> 01:45:14,50
SOMEONE reaches out toward SOMEONE who stares at the inspector. 

HUGO_DVS714
01:45:17,00 --> 01:45:23,50
SOMEONE struggles as the inspector drags him to his office. 

HUGO_DVS716
01:45:48,00 --> 01:45:53,50
The inspector locks SOMEONE in a metal cage. 

HUGO_DVS717
01:46:18,00 --> 01:46:23,50
The inspector stands with his back to SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS718
01:46:22,00 --> 01:46:27,50
SOMEONE picks the cages lock with a tool. 

HUGO_DVS719
01:46:30,00 --> 01:46:35,50
SOMEONE opens the cage and sneaks out. 

HUGO_DVS720
01:46:41,00 --> 01:46:46,50
The inspector rushes out of his office. 

HUGO_DVS721
01:46:43,00 --> 01:46:51,50
Below, SOMEONE runs across the station. The inspector hurries back into his office and slides down a fireman's pole. 

HUGO_DVS722
01:46:51,00 --> 01:47:03,50
The Doberman follows the inspector as he chases SOMEONE through the crowd. SOMEONE runs around a corner and slides beneath a staircase. The inspector limps around the corner and stares at the deserted corner. 

HUGO_DVS723
01:47:02,00 --> 01:47:07,50
A small vent stands ajar. 

HUGO_DVS724
01:47:05,00 --> 01:47:12,50
Furrowing his brow, the inspector opens the vent and peers inside. 

HUGO_DVS725
01:47:09,00 --> 01:47:14,50
SOMEONE sticks his head in beside him. 

HUGO_DVS726
01:47:12,00 --> 01:47:17,50
SOMEONE runs down a steamy corridor filled with pipes. 

HUGO_DVS727
01:47:15,00 --> 01:47:19,50
He stops and listens. 

HUGO_DVS728
01:47:21,00 --> 01:47:26,50
SOMEONE hurries up the clock tower staircase. 

HUGO_DVS729
01:47:24,00 --> 01:47:30,50
A moment later, the inspector runs to the bottom of the stairs and unleashes SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS730
01:47:29,00 --> 01:47:34,50
The dog bounds up the stairs after SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS731
01:47:34,00 --> 01:47:40,50
The massive pendulum sweeps back and forth as SOMEONE climbs higher. 

HUGO_DVS732
01:47:39,00 --> 01:47:43,50
Slick with sweat, he reaches the top. 

HUGO_DVS733
01:47:42,00 --> 01:47:49,50
SOMEONE peers down the stairs then at the large clockwork mechanism as he paces frantically. 

HUGO_DVS734
01:47:59,00 --> 01:48:05,50
SOMEONE stares through the clear glass panels of one of the giant clocks. 

HUGO_DVS735
01:48:02,00 --> 01:48:07,50
The Eiffel Tower glows with lights in the distance. 

HUGO_DVS736
01:48:10,00 --> 01:48:16,50
He pushes open a hinged window pane and stares at the street far below. 

HUGO_DVS737
01:48:21,00 --> 01:48:32,50
SOMEONE crawls out of the window and twists himself around. He reaches up and grabs onto the clock's giant minute hand - a thin metal beam pointed at the number three. 

HUGO_DVS738
01:48:32,00 --> 01:48:38,50
He kicks the windows shut with one foot as he dangles. 

HUGO_DVS739
01:48:36,00 --> 01:48:43,50
Inching sideways, SOMEONE moves toward the far end of the minute hand, out of view of the windows. 

HUGO_DVS740
01:48:48,00 --> 01:48:54,50
SOMEONE reaches the top of the stairs and sniffs some boxes and rags. 

HUGO_DVS741
01:48:52,00 --> 01:48:59,50
Standing beside him, the inspector peers up at the clockwork's giant moving gears. 

HUGO_DVS742
01:49:00,00 --> 01:49:07,50
Tufts of snow fall as SOMEONE slides his fingers along the top of the minute hand. 

HUGO_DVS743
01:49:07,00 --> 01:49:13,50
As he reaches the end of the bar, one of the clockwork's gears snaps. 

HUGO_DVS744
01:49:16,00 --> 01:49:23,50
SOMEONE hangs on tightly as the minute hand drops about a foot. SOMEONE's ears prick up. 

HUGO_DVS745
01:49:20,00 --> 01:49:26,50
SOMEONE lowers himself onto the curved bottom rim of the clock face. 

HUGO_DVS746
01:49:23,00 --> 01:49:31,50
He peers into a window as SOMEONE and the inspector poke their heads into the clockwork's interior. 

HUGO_DVS747
01:49:28,00 --> 01:49:34,50
He ducks as the inspector swivels and glances over his shoulder. 

HUGO_DVS749
01:49:42,00 --> 01:49:46,50
SOMEONE leans his face against the clock as SOMEONE and the inspector head back downstairs. 

HUGO_DVS750
01:49:46,00 --> 01:49:53,50
SOMEONE sits on the bottom of the clock with his feet resting on a small ledge covered in snow. 

HUGO_DVS752
01:49:51,00 --> 01:49:57,50
A few cars motor along the street far below. 

HUGO_DVS753
01:49:57,00 --> 01:50:03,50
He makes his way back to the center of the clock, 

HUGO_DVS754
01:50:00,00 --> 01:50:05,50
opens the window, and climbs inside. 

HUGO_DVS755
01:50:08,00 --> 01:50:13,50
SOMEONE dashes down the stairs. 

HUGO_DVS756
01:50:15,00 --> 01:50:27,50
In the candlelit attic, SOMEONE throws a sheet over the automaton and carries it away. Clutching the automaton to his chest, SOMEONE wades through a river of people exiting a train platform. 

HUGO_DVS757
01:50:31,00 --> 01:50:36,50
The inspector rushes up behind SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS758
01:50:35,00 --> 01:50:42,50
A train door swings open and reflects the inspector in the glass. 

HUGO_DVS759
01:50:39,00 --> 01:50:43,50
SOMEONE's eyes widen. 

HUGO_DVS760
01:50:43,00 --> 01:50:47,50
SOMEONE ducks through the train. 

HUGO_DVS761
01:50:45,00 --> 01:50:51,50
SOMEONE exits onto the opposite platform but is cornered by SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS762
01:50:49,00 --> 01:50:57,50
As the inspector yanks SOMEONE, the automaton sails into the air. The inspector gazes up at it. 

HUGO_DVS763
01:50:56,00 --> 01:51:06,50
SOMEONE kicks the inspector in the shin, causing him to lose his grip. SOMEONE moves under the automaton with his arms outstretched but stops at the edge of the platform. 

HUGO_DVS764
01:51:07,00 --> 01:51:11,50
The automaton drops onto the tracks. 

HUGO_DVS765
01:51:09,00 --> 01:51:15,50
SOMEONE glances down the rails at an oncoming train then at the automaton. 

HUGO_DVS766
01:51:16,00 --> 01:51:21,50
He jumps down onto the tracks. 

HUGO_DVS767
01:51:21,00 --> 01:51:27,50
The sooty faced engineer sticks his head out of the side of the train. 

HUGO_DVS768
01:51:25,00 --> 01:51:30,50
SOMEONE crouches as the train approaches. 

HUGO_DVS769
01:51:31,00 --> 01:51:35,50
The engineers throw on the brakes. 

HUGO_DVS770
01:51:32,00 --> 01:51:42,50
SOMEONE's hair blows back as he is illuminated by the train's headlight. The inspector reaches down and pulls SOMEONE and the automaton safely onto the platform. 

HUGO_DVS771
01:51:46,00 --> 01:51:50,50
SOMEONE shakes his head. 

HUGO_DVS772
01:51:48,00 --> 01:51:52,50
He yanks SOMEONE to his feet. 

HUGO_DVS773
01:51:52,00 --> 01:51:56,50
He pulls the boy through the crowd. 

HUGO_DVS774
01:52:26,00 --> 01:52:32,50
The inspector glances down at the brace on his leg. 

HUGO_DVS775
01:52:34,00 --> 01:52:39,50
SOMEONE takes off his hat as he steps forward with SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS776
01:52:49,00 --> 01:52:53,50
The inspector eyes SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS777
01:52:51,00 --> 01:52:56,50
He glances at SOMEONE who stands nearby staring at them. 

HUGO_DVS778
01:53:03,00 --> 01:53:09,50
The inspector releases SOMEONE who carries the automaton to SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS780
01:53:20,00 --> 01:53:26,50
clasps the automaton to his chest then hugs SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS781
01:53:23,00 --> 01:53:30,50
SOMEONE puts one arm around SOMEONE as they all walk off together. 

HUGO_DVS782
01:53:29,00 --> 01:53:35,50
The inspector stands still and stares at the floor. 

HUGO_DVS783
01:53:35,00 --> 01:53:39,50
SOMEONE approaches him. 

HUGO_DVS784
01:53:38,00 --> 01:53:42,50
She strokes his arm 

HUGO_DVS785
01:53:39,00 --> 01:53:44,50
then slips her arm through his. 

HUGO_DVS786
01:53:55,00 --> 01:54:03,50
Wearing a tuxedo, SOMEONE sits in a crowded theatre. The inspector sits nearby with SOMEONE and the bookseller, Labisse. 

HUGO_DVS787
01:54:33,00 --> 01:54:39,50
Sitting with SOMEONE and SOMEONE, SOMEONE smiles as he applauds. 

HUGO_DVS788
01:54:48,00 --> 01:54:55,50
On stage, SOMEONE steps aside as a spotlight illuminates a curtain. 

HUGO_DVS789
01:54:54,00 --> 01:55:00,50
The curtain parts and SOMEONE walks out wearing a tuxedo. 

HUGO_DVS790
01:55:02,00 --> 01:55:07,50
The audience rises to its feet. 

HUGO_DVS791
01:55:04,00 --> 01:55:09,50
Tears well in SOMEONE's eyes as she stands. 

HUGO_DVS792
01:55:13,00 --> 01:55:18,50
He nods to the audience then bows to SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS793
01:55:16,00 --> 01:55:20,50
SOMEONE grins at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS794
01:56:11,00 --> 01:56:15,50
SOMEONE places one hand on his heart 

HUGO_DVS795
01:56:13,00 --> 01:56:17,50
and nods to SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS796
01:56:34,00 --> 01:56:38,50
He winks at SOMEONE. 

HUGO_DVS797
01:56:53,00 --> 01:57:04,50
SOMEONE holds up his arms then bows and steps backward toward a movie screen. He puts on a top hat and places a cigarette in his mouth, then ducks off stage. 

HUGO_DVS798
01:57:02,00 --> 01:57:09,50
On screen, a young SOMEONE wearing a top hat and smoking a cigarette 

HUGO_DVS799
01:57:06,00 --> 01:57:12,50
straightens then draws a sketch of Shakespeare on a chalkboard. 

HUGO_DVS800
01:57:09,00 --> 01:57:17,50
Next, a fleet of airships, dirigibles, and hot air balloons fly across a cloudy sky. 

HUGO_DVS801
01:57:15,00 --> 01:57:20,50
Wearing a coat and tails, young SOMEONE throws a music clefs. 

HUGO_DVS803
01:57:18,00 --> 01:57:28,50
onto five telegraph wires running overhead. He takes off his own head and throws it onto the wires where it hovers like a musical note. 

HUGO_DVS804
01:57:25,00 --> 01:57:31,50
His head reappears on his shoulders but copies remain. 

HUGO_DVS805
01:57:28,00 --> 01:57:40,50
Standing in the wings, the older SOMEONE chuckles. In other clips, revelers push a chariot across the sky. A magician lifts a giant hat, revealing a woman with butterfly wings. 

HUGO_DVS806
01:57:37,00 --> 01:57:43,50
A witch rides on a flying broomstick through a thunderstorm. 

HUGO_DVS807
01:57:40,00 --> 01:57:48,50
A man pulls off a bearded sheik's robes and skin, leaving a skeleton which collapses into a chair.
