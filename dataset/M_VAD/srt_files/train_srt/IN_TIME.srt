IN_TIME_DVS23
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:46,50
She eyes her arm. 

IN_TIME_DVS24
00:03:19,00 --> 00:03:24,50
SOMEONE pauses on his way out. 

IN_TIME_DVS25
00:03:21,00 --> 00:03:28,50
He and his mother clasp each other's forearms, then rotate his over hers. 

IN_TIME_DVS26
00:03:25,00 --> 00:03:31,50
They watch their clocks tick rapidly on their free arms. 

IN_TIME_DVS27
00:03:29,00 --> 00:03:36,50
SOMEONE's halts at 1 day and 14 minutes, then resumes its normal countdown. 

IN_TIME_DVS28
00:03:35,00 --> 00:03:39,50
He kisses her cheek. 

IN_TIME_DVS29
00:03:43,00 --> 00:03:47,50
His mother beams after him. 

IN_TIME_DVS30
00:03:45,00 --> 00:03:52,50
Leaving the building, SOMEONE steps out onto a street crowded with pedestrians. 

IN_TIME_DVS31
00:03:49,00 --> 00:03:54,50
Posted cameras monitor the neighborhood. 

IN_TIME_DVS32
00:03:54,00 --> 00:03:58,50
A little girl approaches. 

IN_TIME_DVS33
00:03:58,00 --> 00:04:02,50
Her clock doesn't move. 

IN_TIME_DVS34
00:04:04,00 --> 00:04:10,50
SOMEONE holds out a hand. She gives him a flat metal box. 

IN_TIME_DVS35
00:04:08,00 --> 00:04:16,50
He presses its curved receptor to the inside of his wrist. A display ticks up to five minutes. 

IN_TIME_DVS36
00:04:14,00 --> 00:04:19,50
SOMEONE takes the time with a smile. 

IN_TIME_DVS37
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:23,50
Turning a corner, SOMEONE checks his body clock, then breaks into a run. 

IN_TIME_DVS38
00:04:20,00 --> 00:04:31,50
Arriving outside a factory, SOMEONE goes to a coffee cart with the drink prices listed digitally in minutes and seconds. The prices change abruptly. 

IN_TIME_DVS39
00:04:36,00 --> 00:04:42,50
SOMEONE sticks his wrist in a scanner that takes minutes off his timer. 

IN_TIME_DVS40
00:04:44,00 --> 00:04:49,50
Opening a flask, SOMEONE spikes his coffee. 

IN_TIME_DVS41
00:04:49,00 --> 00:04:54,50
Two men clasp each other's arms. 

IN_TIME_DVS42
00:04:51,00 --> 00:04:58,50
Now an inky black body clock shows all zeros on a dead man's arm. 

IN_TIME_DVS43
00:04:59,00 --> 00:05:05,50
A well-dressed man standing over the corpse meets their gaze. 

IN_TIME_DVS44
00:05:02,00 --> 00:05:10,50
As SOMEONE moves on, SOMEONE lingers, holding the thin man's gaze with narrowed eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS45
00:05:07,00 --> 00:05:13,50
Later, he stands at a machine inside the factory. 

IN_TIME_DVS46
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:17,50
SOMEONE sets a flat metal box on a platform, then pulls a lever. 

IN_TIME_DVS47
00:05:14,00 --> 00:05:24,50
As he repeats the process, a complete portable time capsule rolls down a conveyor sporting the curved receptor at one end. 

IN_TIME_DVS48
00:05:21,00 --> 00:05:25,50
It joins others in a bin. 

IN_TIME_DVS49
00:05:23,00 --> 00:05:30,50
Now, the factory workers file past a scanner. Each sticking their wrist in as they go. 

IN_TIME_DVS50
00:05:27,00 --> 00:05:32,50
Heading off, SOMEONE checks his clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS51
00:05:43,00 --> 00:05:48,50
SOMEONE marches out sullenly. 

IN_TIME_DVS52
00:05:45,00 --> 00:05:53,50
Now, he arrives at a harshly lit doorway where a sign overhead reads Beer/Wine. 

IN_TIME_DVS53
00:05:51,00 --> 00:05:58,50
He enters the bar where women in slinky dresses dance before a live band. 

IN_TIME_DVS54
00:05:55,00 --> 00:06:04,50
One paws at SOMEONE as he passes. Smiling politely, he sidles past and goes to a table where men play cards. 

IN_TIME_DVS55
00:06:11,00 --> 00:06:16,50
SOMEONE grasps the card player's forearm. 

IN_TIME_DVS56
00:06:15,00 --> 00:06:24,50
He moves off down the length of the bar, passing a chiseled well-dressed man flanked by beautiful women. SOMEONE sits at the far end. 

IN_TIME_DVS57
00:06:31,00 --> 00:06:36,50
He points at the well-dressed man. 

IN_TIME_DVS58
00:06:36,00 --> 00:06:41,50
The well-dressed man waves at a bartender. 

IN_TIME_DVS59
00:06:43,00 --> 00:06:49,50
Nearby, a man starring at his exposed body clock hangs up a phone. 

IN_TIME_DVS60
00:06:51,00 --> 00:06:56,50
The women paw at the well-dressed man. 

IN_TIME_DVS61
00:06:53,00 --> 00:06:59,50
Clad in dark clothes, the stranger glares coldly at him. 

IN_TIME_DVS62
00:06:56,00 --> 00:07:01,50
Noticing, SOMEONE approaches the wealthy man. 

IN_TIME_DVS63
00:07:06,00 --> 00:07:11,50
The handsome man sips his drink casually. 

IN_TIME_DVS64
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:28,50
The door bursts open and a group of thugs saunter in. As the bar clears, SOMEONE sticks by the rich man's side. 

IN_TIME_DVS65
00:07:28,00 --> 00:07:34,50
A blonde man with a gun leads the thugs. 

IN_TIME_DVS66
00:07:35,00 --> 00:07:42,50
SOMEONE leads SOMEONE to a back hall. The rich man stands and faces the thugs. 

IN_TIME_DVS67
00:07:51,00 --> 00:07:59,50
As SOMEONE leaves, SOMEONE watches the rich stranger and the minutemen. Their leader sets his gun down. 

IN_TIME_DVS68
00:07:58,00 --> 00:08:03,50
His gaze drifts towards the rich man's clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS69
00:08:04,00 --> 00:08:09,50
The wealthy man's hand curls into a fist. 

IN_TIME_DVS70
00:08:12,00 --> 00:08:16,50
He glares at the gangster. 

IN_TIME_DVS71
00:08:15,00 --> 00:08:19,50
SOMEONE removes his overcoat. 

IN_TIME_DVS72
00:08:25,00 --> 00:08:31,50
His smooth ageless features give a smirk. 

IN_TIME_DVS73
00:08:29,00 --> 00:08:36,50
The wealthy man takes a few steps forward, then shifts his uneasy gaze and loosens his tie. 

IN_TIME_DVS74
00:08:36,00 --> 00:08:41,50
SOMEONE steps out of view as the man backs away. 

IN_TIME_DVS75
00:08:39,00 --> 00:08:48,50
The stranger bumps a table, then rushes nauseously into the back hall where he pushes his way in to a men's room. 

IN_TIME_DVS76
00:08:45,00 --> 00:08:51,50
Posted nearby, a thug in a fedora follows him. 

IN_TIME_DVS77
00:08:48,00 --> 00:08:54,50
Crouching at a toilet, the rich man vomits. 

IN_TIME_DVS78
00:08:58,00 --> 00:09:04,50
From hiding, SOMEONE swings a stall door, knocking out the thug. 

IN_TIME_DVS79
00:09:02,00 --> 00:09:08,50
Out front, SOMEONE spies SOMEONE hustling the rich man out. 

IN_TIME_DVS80
00:09:06,00 --> 00:09:10,50
In an alley. 

IN_TIME_DVS81
00:09:12,00 --> 00:09:17,50
SOMEONE blocks the exit with a dumpster. 

IN_TIME_DVS82
00:09:17,00 --> 00:09:24,50
He leads the wealthy man down the alley and out onto a street. 

IN_TIME_DVS83
00:09:21,00 --> 00:09:28,50
SOMEONE and his men leave the bar through the front exit and get in a waiting car. 

IN_TIME_DVS84
00:09:26,00 --> 00:09:32,50
The car pursues SOMEONE and the stranger down a deserted street. 

IN_TIME_DVS85
00:09:31,00 --> 00:09:35,50
The two men reach a gate. 

IN_TIME_DVS86
00:09:33,00 --> 00:09:38,50
SOMEONE boosts the stranger into climbing it. 

IN_TIME_DVS87
00:09:38,00 --> 00:09:44,50
Climbing after his companion, SOMEONE drops down on the other side as the car arrives. 

IN_TIME_DVS88
00:09:44,00 --> 00:09:56,50
As SOMEONE drags the stranger down an alley, the car backs out of view. The two men reach a door and SOMEONE breaks a chain locking it shut. The stranger starts to wander off. 

IN_TIME_DVS89
00:09:56,00 --> 00:10:03,50
SOMEONE yanks him through the doorway, then uses the chain to pull the door shut behind them. 

IN_TIME_DVS90
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:05,50
The car speeds into view. 

IN_TIME_DVS91
00:10:02,00 --> 00:10:13,50
Hidden in a shadowy space, SOMEONE gets a firm grip on the chain. The gangsters get out of the car and bang against doorways spaced along the long wall. 

IN_TIME_DVS92
00:10:15,00 --> 00:10:22,50
Wielding a gun, the fedora-wearing thug marches up to SOMEONE's door and kicks the lock. 

IN_TIME_DVS93
00:10:19,00 --> 00:10:28,50
As he tugs at it, the working man on the other side holds the chain tightly. The thug gives up and moves on. 

IN_TIME_DVS94
00:10:25,00 --> 00:10:30,50
SOMEONE leads the rich stranger away. 

IN_TIME_DVS95
00:10:27,00 --> 00:10:35,50
As SOMEONE angrily scans the alley, SOMEONE leads his companion up an abandoned stairway. 

IN_TIME_DVS97
00:10:33,00 --> 00:10:39,50
the fedora-wearing thug stands behind SOMEONE' shoulder. 

IN_TIME_DVS98
00:10:43,00 --> 00:10:49,50
A malicious smile flickers across SOMEONE' features. 

IN_TIME_DVS99
00:10:48,00 --> 00:10:58,50
Now, in a large abandoned space, SOMEONE shoves the stranger onto a leather bench, then crosses to a wall of dirty broken windows. 

IN_TIME_DVS100
00:11:09,00 --> 00:11:15,50
SOMEONE takes out a flask and unscrews its cap. 

IN_TIME_DVS101
00:11:14,00 --> 00:11:19,50
He holds it out to his rescuer and nods insistently. 

IN_TIME_DVS102
00:11:17,00 --> 00:11:22,50
Taking it, SOMEONE sips. 

IN_TIME_DVS103
00:11:20,00 --> 00:11:25,50
He shuts his eyes and shakes his head. 

IN_TIME_DVS104
00:11:27,00 --> 00:11:32,50
SOMEONE reluctantly takes another swig. 

IN_TIME_DVS105
00:11:30,00 --> 00:11:34,50
He shakes his head again. 

IN_TIME_DVS106
00:11:35,00 --> 00:11:41,50
He returns the flask to his smiling companion. 

IN_TIME_DVS107
00:11:38,00 --> 00:11:44,50
SOMEONE's smile fades as a car crawls past outside. 

IN_TIME_DVS108
00:11:53,00 --> 00:11:57,50
Smirking, SOMEONE checks his clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS109
00:11:55,00 --> 00:12:00,50
It reads 18 hours 58 minutes. 

IN_TIME_DVS110
00:12:28,00 --> 00:12:34,50
SOMEONE faces the rich man with a bemused frown. 

IN_TIME_DVS111
00:12:35,00 --> 00:12:41,50
He stalks closer to SOMEONE, sneering bitterly. 

IN_TIME_DVS112
00:12:43,00 --> 00:12:47,50
The rich man lowers his head. 

IN_TIME_DVS113
00:12:48,00 --> 00:12:57,50
He meets the working class man's knowing gaze. As SOMEONE turns away, SOMEONE stares ahead with a haunted expression. 

IN_TIME_DVS114
00:12:57,00 --> 00:13:04,50
SOMEONE faces him, then sinks into a leather armchair positioned opposite the bench. 

IN_TIME_DVS115
00:13:14,00 --> 00:13:20,50
SOMEONE blinks quizzically and tilts his head. 

IN_TIME_DVS116
00:13:50,00 --> 00:13:57,50
Under SOMEONE's earnest gaze, SOMEONE blinks heavily and looks away. 

IN_TIME_DVS117
00:13:54,00 --> 00:13:59,50
The rich man eyes his companion's arm. 

IN_TIME_DVS118
00:14:05,00 --> 00:14:12,50
SOMEONE pulls up his sleeve and watches his clock seconds tick away. 

IN_TIME_DVS119
00:14:22,00 --> 00:14:27,50
SOMEONE gives a small nod, his eyes glistening. 

IN_TIME_DVS120
00:14:27,00 --> 00:14:33,50
He stares off sadly, then meets SOMEONE's stoic gaze. 

IN_TIME_DVS121
00:14:32,00 --> 00:14:39,50
SOMEONE stares at the glowing clock ticking down his own body's time. 

IN_TIME_DVS122
00:14:41,00 --> 00:14:46,50
They share a brief wry smile. 

IN_TIME_DVS123
00:14:44,00 --> 00:14:49,50
SOMEONE leans forward, holding out the flask. 

IN_TIME_DVS124
00:14:46,00 --> 00:14:54,50
SOMEONE brings it to his lips hesitantly, then swigs at it with increasing enthusiasm. 

IN_TIME_DVS125
00:14:57,00 --> 00:15:05,50
He returns the flask to its melancholy owner, who tips it in a silent toast and drinks. 

IN_TIME_DVS127
00:15:04,00 --> 00:15:13,50
Daylight pours in through the windows as SOMEONE lies back on the bench, his head on the meagerly padded armrest. 

IN_TIME_DVS128
00:15:10,00 --> 00:15:14,50
Facing him, SOMEONE sleeps in the armchair. 

IN_TIME_DVS130
00:15:13,00 --> 00:15:19,50
The rich man wakes and turn toward his rescuer. 

IN_TIME_DVS131
00:15:16,00 --> 00:15:22,50
We drift closer to the working class man as he slumbers peacefully, 

IN_TIME_DVS132
00:15:20,00 --> 00:15:25,50
his arms dangling over their rests. 

IN_TIME_DVS133
00:15:22,00 --> 00:15:27,50
SOMEONE creeps over to SOMEONE and crouches at his side. 

IN_TIME_DVS134
00:15:25,00 --> 00:15:29,50
Pulling back his sleeve, 

IN_TIME_DVS135
00:15:26,00 --> 00:15:32,50
he slips his own wrist under SOMEONE's. 

IN_TIME_DVS136
00:15:29,00 --> 00:15:36,50
He glances at SOMEONE with wide eyes, then looks down at his body clock 

IN_TIME_DVS137
00:15:33,00 --> 00:15:39,50
and watches the rapidly decreasing count. 

IN_TIME_DVS138
00:15:36,00 --> 00:15:42,50
As he reaches a balance of five minutes, 

IN_TIME_DVS139
00:15:39,00 --> 00:15:43,50
SOMEONE halts the transfer. 

IN_TIME_DVS141
00:15:45,00 --> 00:15:49,50
SOMEONE wakes with a start. 

IN_TIME_DVS142
00:15:47,00 --> 00:15:53,50
Getting his bearings, he habitually checks his body clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS143
00:15:50,00 --> 00:15:56,50
It reads over 116 years. 

IN_TIME_DVS144
00:15:54,00 --> 00:16:01,50
The working class man looks around, finds himself alone, and sits up. 

IN_TIME_DVS145
00:15:58,00 --> 00:16:04,50
Facing the windows, he stands abruptly and steps closer. 

IN_TIME_DVS146
00:16:02,00 --> 00:16:07,50
Letters written in the grime of a glass pane read: 

IN_TIME_DVS147
00:16:04,00 --> 00:16:09,50
"Don't waste my time." 

IN_TIME_DVS148
00:16:07,00 --> 00:16:17,50
Peering out a broken pane next to it, SOMEONE spots SOMEONE sitting on the railing of a high stone bridge, his feet dangling over the side. 

IN_TIME_DVS149
00:16:14,00 --> 00:16:23,50
The melancholy man faces the river and distant mountains as his body clock ticks down under 15 seconds. 

IN_TIME_DVS150
00:16:20,00 --> 00:16:29,50
He blinks his clear pale eyes in the bright morning sun and his woeful expression grows serene. 

IN_TIME_DVS151
00:16:26,00 --> 00:16:32,50
His clock ticks out its last three seconds. 

IN_TIME_DVS152
00:16:29,00 --> 00:16:35,50
SOMEONE's back arches and he grimaces painfully. 

IN_TIME_DVS153
00:16:34,00 --> 00:16:43,50
His body falls from the railing, tumbles midair, and splashes into the shallow water 50 feet below. 

IN_TIME_DVS154
00:16:40,00 --> 00:16:46,50
SOMEONE sprints onto the bridge and peers over the railing. 

IN_TIME_DVS155
00:16:44,00 --> 00:16:52,50
The shallow river's current rushes around SOMEONE as he sprawls motionless on its concrete bed. 

IN_TIME_DVS156
00:16:49,00 --> 00:16:56,50
A mounted camera lowers its view towards SOMEONE, who wearily hurries away. 

IN_TIME_DVS157
00:16:57,00 --> 00:17:03,50
Now, at an apartment complex, a smiling woman cradles her baby. 

IN_TIME_DVS158
00:17:06,00 --> 00:17:11,50
She eyes the baby's clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS159
00:17:15,00 --> 00:17:20,50
Exiting an apartment, he appears at her side. 

IN_TIME_DVS160
00:17:19,00 --> 00:17:24,50
SOMEONE gives his friend a conspiring nod. 

IN_TIME_DVS161
00:17:24,00 --> 00:17:30,50
As he and SOMEONE head down a flight of stairs into a courtyard, 

IN_TIME_DVS162
00:17:27,00 --> 00:17:32,50
SOMEONE unzips the end of his jacket sleeve. 

IN_TIME_DVS163
00:17:30,00 --> 00:17:34,50
Glancing around, he pulls it up. 

IN_TIME_DVS164
00:17:33,00 --> 00:17:37,50
He shows his clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS165
00:18:01,00 --> 00:18:05,50
Nodding, SOMEONE looks off thoughtfully. 

IN_TIME_DVS166
00:18:03,00 --> 00:18:09,50
A faint smile touches his lips as he turns to SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS167
00:18:13,00 --> 00:18:18,50
Clasping SOMEONE's arm, he holds his gaze. 

IN_TIME_DVS168
00:18:16,00 --> 00:18:21,50
As SOMEONE releases him, SOMEONE checks his clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS169
00:18:21,00 --> 00:18:25,50
SOMEONE claps a hand on his shoulder. 

IN_TIME_DVS170
00:18:36,00 --> 00:18:41,50
SOMEONE nods, then twitches a sad smile. 

IN_TIME_DVS171
00:18:38,00 --> 00:18:43,50
SOMEONE grabs him into a hug. 

IN_TIME_DVS172
00:18:40,00 --> 00:18:46,50
Pulling away, he gives his friend an expectant look. 

IN_TIME_DVS173
00:18:43,00 --> 00:18:48,50
SOMEONE lifts his brow in an encouraging expression, 

IN_TIME_DVS174
00:18:46,00 --> 00:18:50,50
and SOMEONE heads off. 

IN_TIME_DVS175
00:18:47,00 --> 00:18:53,50
SOMEONE stares after him, then checks his clock again. 

IN_TIME_DVS176
00:18:50,00 --> 00:18:55,50
He glances at a bar across the street. 

IN_TIME_DVS177
00:18:59,00 --> 00:19:11,50
Now, SOMEONE's mom scans her wrist. A sign on the building that reads Weis Time Lenders flashes off as she heads away. The windows go dark. SOMEONE's mother boards a bus. 

IN_TIME_DVS178
00:19:10,00 --> 00:19:16,50
With a tense look, she jerks her hand away from the scanner. 

IN_TIME_DVS180
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:38,50
Sliding her sleeve up, she checks the balance on her clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS181
00:19:37,00 --> 00:19:43,50
The bus driver shifts his regretful gaze away. 

IN_TIME_DVS182
00:19:42,00 --> 00:19:50,50
SOMEONE's mother looks at the other passengers who either avoid her gaze or turn away with disengaged expressions. 

IN_TIME_DVS183
00:19:48,00 --> 00:19:55,50
She hurries off the bus and jogs back towards Weis Time Lenders finding it closed. 

IN_TIME_DVS184
00:19:52,00 --> 00:19:56,50
The bus pulls away. 

IN_TIME_DVS185
00:19:54,00 --> 00:19:59,50
SOMEONE's mother glances around, her eyes desperate, 

IN_TIME_DVS186
00:19:56,00 --> 00:20:01,50
then takes off down a desolate street. 

IN_TIME_DVS187
00:19:58,00 --> 00:20:05,50
Ahead of her, the bus's taillights glow in the shadows of dingy buildings. 

IN_TIME_DVS188
00:20:03,00 --> 00:20:10,50
Now, SOMEONE's mother furiously pumps her arms as she runs. 

IN_TIME_DVS189
00:20:07,00 --> 00:20:13,50
Behind her, a truck's headlights grow brighter as it draws closer. 

IN_TIME_DVS190
00:20:18,00 --> 00:20:23,50
She waves at the vehicle which speeds right past. 

IN_TIME_DVS191
00:20:21,00 --> 00:20:27,50
Finding only 20 minutes on her clock, she takes off at a sprint. 

IN_TIME_DVS192
00:20:24,00 --> 00:20:31,50
As the bus stops in Dayton, SOMEONE steps forward holding a bouquet. 

IN_TIME_DVS193
00:20:28,00 --> 00:20:34,50
Two passengers climb off and the doors closed behind them. 

IN_TIME_DVS194
00:20:31,00 --> 00:20:39,50
SOMEONE gazes in at the bus's remaining passengers, then watches the vehicle glide away. 

IN_TIME_DVS195
00:20:36,00 --> 00:20:45,50
His thoughtful eyes shift to a truck heading in the opposite direction and he drops his flowers taking off after it. 

IN_TIME_DVS196
00:20:43,00 --> 00:20:49,50
Meanwhile, his mother hurries toward a man entering a building. 

IN_TIME_DVS197
00:20:53,00 --> 00:20:57,50
He hurries inside and closes the door. 

IN_TIME_DVS198
00:20:57,00 --> 00:21:03,50
Banging on the door, she sees the man glance back then hurry off. 

IN_TIME_DVS199
00:21:00,00 --> 00:21:05,50
She checks her clock. Nine minutes. 

IN_TIME_DVS200
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:08,50
Now, SOMEONE sprints away from Dayton while his mother races toward it. 

IN_TIME_DVS201
00:21:07,00 --> 00:21:14,50
She glances at her left forearm as she runs, her face pinched anxiously. 

IN_TIME_DVS202
00:21:11,00 --> 00:21:19,50
Rounding a corner, she lifts her arm and finds her clock counting down from ten seconds. 

IN_TIME_DVS203
00:21:16,00 --> 00:21:20,50
She races faster. 

IN_TIME_DVS204
00:21:20,00 --> 00:21:27,50
SOMEONE sprints furiously toward his mother from the opposite end of the street. 

IN_TIME_DVS205
00:21:28,00 --> 00:21:39,50
As they draw closer, SOMEONE extends his hand. His mother beams. Three feet before they reach each other, she tumbles forward. He catches her. 

IN_TIME_DVS206
00:21:39,00 --> 00:21:44,50
Dropping to his knees, he cradles her limp body. 

IN_TIME_DVS207
00:21:44,00 --> 00:21:49,50
He finds her clock timed out. 

IN_TIME_DVS208
00:21:48,00 --> 00:21:52,50
His face contorts in anguish. 

IN_TIME_DVS209
00:21:52,00 --> 00:21:57,50
He presses it to her neck, rocking back and forth. 

IN_TIME_DVS210
00:22:01,00 --> 00:22:07,50
With his eyes squeezed shut, he tilts his face skyward. 

IN_TIME_DVS211
00:22:07,00 --> 00:22:14,50
A wide view shows the young man hunched over his mother's body in the barren street, 

IN_TIME_DVS212
00:22:11,00 --> 00:22:17,50
awash with pale light from nearby buildings. 

IN_TIME_DVS214
00:22:15,00 --> 00:22:24,50
Two men in all black drag SOMEONE's body from the shallow stream of water in the otherwise dried up canal. 

IN_TIME_DVS215
00:22:22,00 --> 00:22:29,50
As one checks SOMEONE's clock, a sharp cheek boned man in black approaches. 

IN_TIME_DVS216
00:22:40,00 --> 00:22:44,50
They circle the body. 

IN_TIME_DVS217
00:23:00,00 --> 00:23:05,50
Eyeing the body, he chews his gum thoughtfully. 

IN_TIME_DVS218
00:23:12,00 --> 00:23:19,50
He strides toward his car, his long leather jacket billowing behind him. 

IN_TIME_DVS219
00:23:24,00 --> 00:23:31,50
Shifting his gaze from the blonde in thigh-highs and miniskirt, 

IN_TIME_DVS220
00:23:28,00 --> 00:23:33,50
SOMEONE spots the surveillance camera on the bridge. 

IN_TIME_DVS221
00:23:30,00 --> 00:23:38,50
Now, a luxury sedan stops on a street in Dayton and SOMEONE strides over. 

IN_TIME_DVS222
00:23:37,00 --> 00:23:46,50
SOMEONE glances around, then slides up the sleeve of his charcoal suit jacket and the black dress shirt underneath, displaying the balance on his clock. The chauffeur nods and unlocks a back door. 

IN_TIME_DVS223
00:23:43,00 --> 00:23:48,50
With a cautious look, SOMEONE climbs in. 

IN_TIME_DVS226
00:23:51,00 --> 00:23:58,50
As the sedan glides away, he peers out his widow at the passing city. 

IN_TIME_DVS227
00:23:55,00 --> 00:24:01,50
The chauffeur shoots him a look in the rear view mirror. 

IN_TIME_DVS228
00:24:03,00 --> 00:24:08,50
SOMEONE blinks his sullen eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS229
00:24:07,00 --> 00:24:13,50
The sedan reaches a booth labeled Time Zone 12 Border. 

IN_TIME_DVS230
00:24:10,00 --> 00:24:15,50
A concrete barricade blocks their path. 

IN_TIME_DVS231
00:24:15,00 --> 00:24:24,50
A metal panel cut in at one side to create a C shaped hollow flips up from a console beside SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS232
00:24:22,00 --> 00:24:29,50
He slips his wrist into the cuff-like scanner and watches his clock's balance count down. 

IN_TIME_DVS233
00:24:26,00 --> 00:24:31,50
A green light flashes on the booth 

IN_TIME_DVS234
00:24:28,00 --> 00:24:35,50
and the concrete barricade lowers into the ground, allowing the sedan to pass. 

IN_TIME_DVS235
00:24:33,00 --> 00:24:38,50
Later, the vehicle reaches one end of a bridge marked 

IN_TIME_DVS236
00:24:36,00 --> 00:24:40,50
Time Zone 8 Border. 

IN_TIME_DVS237
00:24:42,00 --> 00:24:47,50
SOMEONE scans his wrists and a barricade lowers. 

IN_TIME_DVS238
00:24:46,00 --> 00:24:51,50
As the sedan glides on, he gives a worried look. 

IN_TIME_DVS239
00:24:53,00 --> 00:25:00,50
They stop at the barricade for Time Zone 4 and the scanner flips up again. 

IN_TIME_DVS240
00:24:57,00 --> 00:25:01,50
SOMEONE inserts his wrist. 

IN_TIME_DVS241
00:24:59,00 --> 00:25:06,50
The sedan trundles through the gap in a six-foot high wall. SOMEONE checks his clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS242
00:25:09,00 --> 00:25:13,50
SOMEONE gives a solemn look. 

IN_TIME_DVS243
00:25:13,00 --> 00:25:18,50
He stares with hardened eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS244
00:25:17,00 --> 00:25:22,50
The chauffeur glances at him. 

IN_TIME_DVS245
00:25:19,00 --> 00:25:24,50
SOMEONE lowers his vengeful gaze. 

IN_TIME_DVS246
00:25:23,00 --> 00:25:29,50
As the sedan glides down a concrete passage way, 

IN_TIME_DVS247
00:25:27,00 --> 00:25:32,50
the time zone barricade rises back up. 

IN_TIME_DVS248
00:25:29,00 --> 00:25:43,50
Now, the luxury vehicle drives down a street in a clean, well-maintained city with elegant towering skyscrapers. It pulls into a business plaza where luxury vehicles wait a curb. 

IN_TIME_DVS249
00:25:41,00 --> 00:25:54,50
Suited men in sunglasses escort well-dressed citizens and chauffeurs assist patrons into cars. A porter pushes a luggage cart down a walkway along a skyscraper's facade. 

IN_TIME_DVS250
00:25:51,00 --> 00:25:58,50
Climbing out of the sedan, SOMEONE sweeps his view around the area. 

IN_TIME_DVS251
00:25:55,00 --> 00:26:02,50
He starts to jog down the walkway and the people strolling past glance at him. 

IN_TIME_DVS252
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:07,50
Stopping by a hotel's front doors, he pulls up his sleeve and checks his clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS253
00:26:04,00 --> 00:26:09,50
He shifts his thoughtful eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS254
00:26:06,00 --> 00:26:15,50
As he strolls to the door, his gaze catches a young woman with chin length auburn hair and large blue eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS255
00:26:12,00 --> 00:26:20,50
Standing at a car's open door, she turns as he passes and stares after him. 

IN_TIME_DVS256
00:26:17,00 --> 00:26:23,50
He glances back at her, then enters the hotel. 

IN_TIME_DVS257
00:26:21,00 --> 00:26:29,50
A suited man with sunglasses and a two-way radio earpiece leans toward the young woman. 

IN_TIME_DVS258
00:26:30,00 --> 00:26:35,50
In the hotel, SOMEONE approaches the front desk. 

IN_TIME_DVS259
00:26:37,00 --> 00:26:43,50
SOMEONE glances at the suited men escorting the hotel's patrons. 

IN_TIME_DVS260
00:26:42,00 --> 00:26:46,50
He holds out his wrist. 

IN_TIME_DVS261
00:26:43,00 --> 00:26:49,50
The two front desk clerks exchange a look. 

IN_TIME_DVS262
00:26:46,00 --> 00:26:55,50
As the female clerk enters information on a computer, her male counterpart puts a time capsule to SOMEONE's wrist. 

IN_TIME_DVS263
00:26:52,00 --> 00:26:56,50
He hands him a key. 

IN_TIME_DVS264
00:26:56,00 --> 00:27:10,50
Now, in a stark building, SOMEONE and a blond timekeeper watch surveillance footage of SOMEONE on the bridge, while SOMEONE eyes a continually changing screen displaying time per capita in each zone. 

IN_TIME_DVS265
00:27:24,00 --> 00:27:28,50
He checks a screen with a map. 

IN_TIME_DVS266
00:27:35,00 --> 00:27:41,50
His gaze flickers over the map of time circulation. 

IN_TIME_DVS267
00:27:40,00 --> 00:27:44,50
He strides away. 

IN_TIME_DVS268
00:27:41,00 --> 00:27:47,50
Now, SOMEONE lies asleep in his elegant suite, 

IN_TIME_DVS269
00:27:44,00 --> 00:27:50,50
his body covered in a downy white comforter. 

IN_TIME_DVS270
00:27:47,00 --> 00:27:52,50
Awaking, he sits up and looks around. 

IN_TIME_DVS271
00:27:50,00 --> 00:27:56,50
He checks his clock which shows over 105 years. 

IN_TIME_DVS272
00:27:56,00 --> 00:28:03,50
Lying back down, he lets his head drop onto the pillow and closes his eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS273
00:28:02,00 --> 00:28:07,50
He opens them again and furrows his brow. 

IN_TIME_DVS274
00:28:04,00 --> 00:28:12,50
Later, a view through the hotel restaurant's window shows SOMEONE eating alone. 

IN_TIME_DVS275
00:28:09,00 --> 00:28:16,50
He shoots furtive glances at his surroundings as he devours his French fries. 

IN_TIME_DVS276
00:28:14,00 --> 00:28:21,50
The auburn-haired young woman watches him from her table on a patio outside. 

IN_TIME_DVS277
00:28:18,00 --> 00:28:24,50
Swallowing, SOMEONE swigs from a champagne flute. 

IN_TIME_DVS278
00:28:21,00 --> 00:28:26,50
A waitress strolls up to his table. 

IN_TIME_DVS279
00:28:27,00 --> 00:28:32,50
Still chewing, SOMEONE holds out his wrist. 

IN_TIME_DVS280
00:28:33,00 --> 00:28:38,50
As she collects his time in a capsule, 

IN_TIME_DVS281
00:28:35,00 --> 00:28:41,50
the auburn-haired young woman continues to watch with intrigued eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS282
00:28:42,00 --> 00:28:46,50
SOMEONE blinks. 

IN_TIME_DVS283
00:28:46,00 --> 00:28:50,50
He gazes at her. 

IN_TIME_DVS284
00:28:48,00 --> 00:28:53,50
She allows a bashful smile. 

IN_TIME_DVS285
00:28:56,00 --> 00:29:00,50
Eyeing him, she grimaces. 

IN_TIME_DVS286
00:29:01,00 --> 00:29:08,50
On the patio, the young woman stops staring as a waitress serves her. 

IN_TIME_DVS287
00:29:05,00 --> 00:29:10,50
Now, at the timekeeper's headquarters. 

IN_TIME_DVS288
00:29:31,00 --> 00:29:36,50
A female timekeeper displays a photo. 

IN_TIME_DVS289
00:29:41,00 --> 00:29:45,50
He stares intently. 

IN_TIME_DVS290
00:29:44,00 --> 00:29:55,50
Nighttime. Inside a palatial mansion, a tuxedoed man greets patrons in black tie. He stops SOMEONE who also wears a tux. 

IN_TIME_DVS291
00:29:53,00 --> 00:29:57,50
SOMEONE appraises the host. 

IN_TIME_DVS292
00:30:05,00 --> 00:30:10,50
With a defiant look, SOMEONE holds out his wrist. 

IN_TIME_DVS293
00:30:07,00 --> 00:30:14,50
As the host collects his time, the newcomer shifts his eyes uncertainly. 

IN_TIME_DVS294
00:30:17,00 --> 00:30:22,50
They head up a staircase to a mezzanine. 

IN_TIME_DVS295
00:30:23,00 --> 00:30:28,50
Later, SOMEONE sits at the poker table. 

IN_TIME_DVS296
00:30:25,00 --> 00:30:31,50
A cube at its center shows 600 years in the pot. 

IN_TIME_DVS297
00:30:28,00 --> 00:30:35,50
He watches with an indifferent expression as the dealer lays out a fourth card. 

IN_TIME_DVS298
00:30:33,00 --> 00:30:38,50
The man across from SOMEONE scrutinizes him. 

IN_TIME_DVS299
00:30:47,00 --> 00:30:52,50
SOMEONE's clock displays over 250 years. 

IN_TIME_DVS300
00:30:55,00 --> 00:31:00,50
SOMEONE glances at the suited men posted nearby. 

IN_TIME_DVS301
00:31:02,00 --> 00:31:10,50
SOMEONE grins. Checking his cards, he finds a pair of queens and places his wrist under a scanner. 

IN_TIME_DVS302
00:31:08,00 --> 00:31:14,50
The cube's balance ticks up to 650. 

IN_TIME_DVS303
00:31:12,00 --> 00:31:18,50
As SOMEONE shifts his uncertain eyes, SOMEONE gives a knowing smile. 

IN_TIME_DVS304
00:31:31,00 --> 00:31:36,50
SOMEONE covers his clock with his sleeve. 

IN_TIME_DVS305
00:31:35,00 --> 00:31:42,50
SOMEONE slides his wrist under a scanner, his eyes fixed on SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS306
00:31:39,00 --> 00:31:44,50
The dealer sets a fifth card face up. 

IN_TIME_DVS307
00:31:41,00 --> 00:31:50,50
Both players lift their gazes as the auburn-haired young woman approaches with her dark-haired guard right behind her. 

IN_TIME_DVS308
00:31:47,00 --> 00:31:52,50
Sitting beside SOMEONE, she stares at SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS309
00:32:08,00 --> 00:32:14,50
His clock shows over 9000 years. 

IN_TIME_DVS310
00:32:12,00 --> 00:32:18,50
SOMEONE watches the pot tick up to 900 years. 

IN_TIME_DVS311
00:32:32,00 --> 00:32:36,50
He scans his wrist. 

IN_TIME_DVS312
00:32:33,00 --> 00:32:39,50
With his eyes fixed on SOMEONE, he reaches for his cards. 

IN_TIME_DVS313
00:32:37,00 --> 00:32:43,50
Spotting his exposed arm, the auburn-haired woman leans closer. 

IN_TIME_DVS314
00:32:40,00 --> 00:32:45,50
SOMEONE's jaw drops. 

IN_TIME_DVS315
00:32:42,00 --> 00:32:48,50
SOMEONE follows their eyes to the 23 seconds remaining on his clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS316
00:32:49,00 --> 00:32:55,50
He meets SOMEONE's gaze and tossed down his pair of queens. 

IN_TIME_DVS317
00:32:53,00 --> 00:32:57,50
SOMEONE considers the cards. 

IN_TIME_DVS318
00:32:55,00 --> 00:33:01,50
Looking down at his own, he flips them over to reveal an eight and a four. 

IN_TIME_DVS319
00:32:59,00 --> 00:33:05,50
The dealer slides two cards from his five giving SOMEONE a straight. 

IN_TIME_DVS320
00:33:03,00 --> 00:33:10,50
SOMEONE shoots the auburn-haired woman a sidelong glance. 

IN_TIME_DVS321
00:33:08,00 --> 00:33:12,50
She lowers her eyes to his clock, which ticks down from five seconds. 

IN_TIME_DVS322
00:33:11,00 --> 00:33:17,50
SOMEONE casually sets his wrist on a time dispenser. 

IN_TIME_DVS323
00:33:14,00 --> 00:33:21,50
His clock counts up to 1100 years and one second. 

IN_TIME_DVS324
00:33:25,00 --> 00:33:29,50
SOMEONE gives a tight smile. 

IN_TIME_DVS325
00:33:28,00 --> 00:33:31,50
He rises. 

IN_TIME_DVS326
00:33:29,00 --> 00:33:34,50
The auburn-haired woman and SOMEONE follow suit. 

IN_TIME_DVS327
00:33:37,00 --> 00:33:42,50
SOMEONE glances at the young woman. 

IN_TIME_DVS328
00:33:41,00 --> 00:33:46,50
SOMEONE follows his gaze. 

IN_TIME_DVS329
00:33:52,00 --> 00:33:56,50
SOMEONE gives a nod. 

IN_TIME_DVS330
00:33:55,00 --> 00:33:59,50
SOMEONE twitches a smile. 

IN_TIME_DVS331
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:17,50
SOMEONE looks at her. 

IN_TIME_DVS332
00:34:20,00 --> 00:34:24,50
She holds his gaze. 

IN_TIME_DVS333
00:34:29,00 --> 00:34:40,50
SOMEONE casts SOMEONE a fascinated look, then follows her father downstairs. SOMEONE checks his clock which now displays a minute and fifteen seconds less. 

IN_TIME_DVS334
00:34:40,00 --> 00:34:46,50
Now in an auto showroom, SOMEONE sits in a silver Roadster. 

IN_TIME_DVS335
00:34:47,00 --> 00:34:52,50
He stares at the sales attendant, then shifts his gaze. 

IN_TIME_DVS336
00:34:51,00 --> 00:34:57,50
His expression grows resolute and he thrusts out his wrist. 

IN_TIME_DVS337
00:34:54,00 --> 00:35:00,50
The sales attendant holds a time capsule to it and smiles. 

IN_TIME_DVS338
00:35:04,00 --> 00:35:09,50
SOMEONE eyes the dashboard admiringly. 

IN_TIME_DVS339
00:35:09,00 --> 00:35:12,50
At dusk. 

IN_TIME_DVS340
00:35:10,00 --> 00:35:18,50
The Roadster speeds along a winding road built into a cliff face as ocean waves crash below. 

IN_TIME_DVS341
00:35:15,00 --> 00:35:23,50
At night, the Roadster turns, pulls through an open gate, and passes a marble statue. 

IN_TIME_DVS342
00:35:20,00 --> 00:35:27,50
It pulls up to a vast opulent mansion with a column-framed entrance. 

IN_TIME_DVS343
00:35:24,00 --> 00:35:32,50
Just inside, SOMEONE stands with SOMEONE and two other auburn-haired beauties. 

IN_TIME_DVS344
00:35:50,00 --> 00:35:57,50
As SOMEONE steps into the party, SOMEONE smirks and SOMEONE gazes discreetly after him. 

IN_TIME_DVS345
00:35:55,00 --> 00:36:02,50
Now, at a buffet table, SOMEONE scoops up a spoonful of caviar and sniffs it. 

IN_TIME_DVS346
00:35:59,00 --> 00:36:04,50
Eyeing the food dubiously, he puts it back. 

IN_TIME_DVS347
00:36:01,00 --> 00:36:07,50
SOMEONE saunters over, trailed closely by her guard. 

IN_TIME_DVS348
00:36:14,00 --> 00:36:19,50
SOMEONE's guard eyes her uncertainly, then moves off. 

IN_TIME_DVS349
00:36:21,00 --> 00:36:26,50
SOMEONE smiles briefly and cocks his head. 

IN_TIME_DVS350
00:36:56,00 --> 00:37:02,50
SOMEONE glances toward a doorway framing her parents. 

IN_TIME_DVS351
00:37:00,00 --> 00:37:08,50
Now, on a sparsely populated dance floor, SOMEONE twirls into SOMEONE's grasp. 

IN_TIME_DVS352
00:37:05,00 --> 00:37:10,50
He holds her close as they dance. 

IN_TIME_DVS353
00:37:19,00 --> 00:37:23,50
SOMEONE adverts his gaze, 

IN_TIME_DVS354
00:37:21,00 --> 00:37:26,50
but SOMEONE leans her full lips closer. 

IN_TIME_DVS355
00:37:24,00 --> 00:37:30,50
Her parents watch vigilantly from the doorway. 

IN_TIME_DVS356
00:37:27,00 --> 00:37:31,50
SOMEONE notices. 

IN_TIME_DVS357
00:37:34,00 --> 00:37:39,50
SOMEONE regards her incredulously. 

IN_TIME_DVS358
00:37:53,00 --> 00:37:57,50
SOMEONE stops swaying. 

IN_TIME_DVS359
00:37:54,00 --> 00:37:59,50
SOMEONE follows suite, lowing her hands. 

IN_TIME_DVS360
00:37:57,00 --> 00:38:01,50
He abruptly takes one. 

IN_TIME_DVS361
00:38:00,00 --> 00:38:06,50
As he leads her out, SOMEONE looks on with a seething glare. 

IN_TIME_DVS362
00:38:03,00 --> 00:38:10,50
SOMEONE glances over her shoulder as SOMEONE leads her out and across a back porch. 

IN_TIME_DVS363
00:38:07,00 --> 00:38:16,50
At the timekeeper's headquarters, SOMEONE joins his men who watch video footage of SOMEONE's arrival at the party. 

IN_TIME_DVS364
00:38:16,00 --> 00:38:21,50
The Roadster passes through the open gate. 

IN_TIME_DVS365
00:38:21,00 --> 00:38:26,50
SOMEONE leads his men out at a march. 

IN_TIME_DVS366
00:38:23,00 --> 00:38:31,50
Now, SOMEONE leads SOMEONE down marble steps to a sandy beach enclosed within rock formations. 

IN_TIME_DVS367
00:38:33,00 --> 00:38:39,50
Smiling appreciatively at the ocean, SOMEONE takes his clothes off. 

IN_TIME_DVS368
00:38:41,00 --> 00:38:46,50
SOMEONE unbuttons his shirt and grins. 

IN_TIME_DVS369
00:38:52,00 --> 00:38:58,50
SOMEONE starts for the ocean, then pauses and turns back, unbuckling his belt. 

IN_TIME_DVS370
00:38:59,00 --> 00:39:04,50
She watches him get in the water. 

IN_TIME_DVS371
00:39:08,00 --> 00:39:13,50
She gazes longingly toward the ocean. 

IN_TIME_DVS372
00:39:10,00 --> 00:39:21,50
Now, from underwater, we gaze up at the silhouetted naked forms of SOMEONE and SOMEONE as they swim side by side. 

IN_TIME_DVS373
00:39:18,00 --> 00:39:24,50
The green light from their body clocks glows in the water. 

IN_TIME_DVS374
00:39:21,00 --> 00:39:26,50
They pause near a rock formation. 

IN_TIME_DVS375
00:39:23,00 --> 00:39:30,50
As they tread water, they bring their open mouths teasingly close. 

IN_TIME_DVS376
00:39:29,00 --> 00:39:34,50
SOMEONE soberly paddles back a little. 

IN_TIME_DVS377
00:39:33,00 --> 00:39:40,50
As she maintains her distances, calm waves splash between them. 

IN_TIME_DVS378
00:39:49,00 --> 00:39:54,50
SOMEONE comes down the steps. 

IN_TIME_DVS379
00:39:52,00 --> 00:39:57,50
She leads SOMEONE toward the rock formations. 

IN_TIME_DVS380
00:39:55,00 --> 00:40:00,50
They swim around behind one and hide. 

IN_TIME_DVS381
00:39:58,00 --> 00:40:07,50
Sea spray forms a light mist over the water's surface as SOMEONE shifts her gaze between SOMEONE and the mansion. 

IN_TIME_DVS382
00:40:09,00 --> 00:40:19,50
SOMEONE grins. Beneath the water's surface, SOMEONE's body clock read over a thousand years. He smiles at SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS383
00:40:17,00 --> 00:40:23,50
SOMEONE briefly leans closer to him, then swims away. 

IN_TIME_DVS384
00:40:21,00 --> 00:40:26,50
SOMEONE gazes after her and follows. 

IN_TIME_DVS385
00:40:23,00 --> 00:40:29,50
Now, SOMEONE walks through the party, shifting his agitated gaze. 

IN_TIME_DVS386
00:40:27,00 --> 00:40:32,50
He encounters a fully dressed SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS387
00:40:35,00 --> 00:40:39,50
SOMEONE arrives behind her father. 

IN_TIME_DVS388
00:40:38,00 --> 00:40:43,50
Turning, SOMEONE spots her and smiles. 

IN_TIME_DVS389
00:40:45,00 --> 00:40:52,50
SOMEONE buttons his jacket and accompanies his host into the spacious foyer. 

IN_TIME_DVS390
00:40:50,00 --> 00:40:56,50
Ahead, the elegant guests scatter as SOMEONE and his men march in. 

IN_TIME_DVS391
00:41:05,00 --> 00:41:10,50
SOMEONE's cool blue eyes shift to SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS392
00:41:11,00 --> 00:41:15,50
SOMEONE nods and steps aside. 

IN_TIME_DVS393
00:41:13,00 --> 00:41:19,50
SOMEONE and his blonde partner march forward and seize SOMEONE by the arms. 

IN_TIME_DVS394
00:41:17,00 --> 00:41:23,50
He glances over his shoulder at SOMEONE as they march him to the staircase. 

IN_TIME_DVS395
00:41:20,00 --> 00:41:25,50
SOMEONE climbs up after them. 

IN_TIME_DVS396
00:41:22,00 --> 00:41:31,50
Now, in a study, the blond timekeeper plants SOMEONE's arm on a desk and exposes his body clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS397
00:41:28,00 --> 00:41:35,50
From the far side of the room, SOMEONE strolls over and takes a seat on the other side of the desk. 

IN_TIME_DVS398
00:41:40,00 --> 00:41:46,50
SOMEONE unknots his tie with a breezy smirk and shrugs his head. 

IN_TIME_DVS399
00:41:47,00 --> 00:41:53,50
SOMEONE twiddles his thumbs and regards the suspect impassively. 

IN_TIME_DVS400
00:42:01,00 --> 00:42:08,50
The timekeeper and suspect stare at each other, neither betraying a hint of emotion. 

IN_TIME_DVS401
00:42:11,00 --> 00:42:17,50
SOMEONE gives a patient, amused smile, then narrows his eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS402
00:42:15,00 --> 00:42:23,50
SOMEONE's smirk fades but he maintains steady eye contact with the timekeeper. 

IN_TIME_DVS403
00:43:10,00 --> 00:43:14,50
SOMEONE stands. 

IN_TIME_DVS404
00:43:24,00 --> 00:43:29,50
He strolls over to SOMEONE's side of the desk. 

IN_TIME_DVS405
00:43:31,00 --> 00:43:37,50
SOMEONE coldly turns away and SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS406
00:43:38,00 --> 00:43:43,50
He and the blonde extract it from his body clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS407
00:43:44,00 --> 00:43:49,50
The timekeepers finish and head out of the study. 

IN_TIME_DVS408
00:43:50,00 --> 00:43:55,50
SOMEONE calmly pauses and turns back. 

IN_TIME_DVS409
00:43:54,00 --> 00:43:59,50
He marches toward the desk, his lips parted. 

IN_TIME_DVS410
00:43:56,00 --> 00:44:02,50
Halting, he gives an amazed shake of the head. 

IN_TIME_DVS411
00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:22,50
SOMEONE gives him a sharp look. 

IN_TIME_DVS412
00:44:24,00 --> 00:44:31,50
SOMEONE leaves the room, joining SOMEONE and his daughter in the hall. SOMEONE starts to go. 

IN_TIME_DVS413
00:44:38,00 --> 00:44:42,50
She stalks off. 

IN_TIME_DVS414
00:44:40,00 --> 00:44:47,50
SOMEONE springs up, grabs a timekeeper's gun and punches both officers flanking him. 

IN_TIME_DVS415
00:44:45,00 --> 00:44:53,50
As SOMEONE trots down to the foyer, SOMEONE leaves the study and rushes down the other side of the twin stairway. 

IN_TIME_DVS416
00:44:51,00 --> 00:44:56,50
Halfway down, a timekeeper intercepts him. 

IN_TIME_DVS417
00:44:53,00 --> 00:44:59,50
He kicks the lawman back and swings over the railing. 

IN_TIME_DVS418
00:44:56,00 --> 00:45:06,50
SOMEONE flings a guard to the floor, then grabs SOMEONE. Using her as a human shield, he backs out of the foyer and enters a kitchen. 

IN_TIME_DVS419
00:45:07,00 --> 00:45:15,50
Fighting his way outside, he finds SOMEONE at his Roadster. The guard aims a gun. 

IN_TIME_DVS420
00:45:14,00 --> 00:45:19,50
He obeys and SOMEONE knocks him out. 

IN_TIME_DVS421
00:45:17,00 --> 00:45:25,50
He takes the guard's gun and gets in is car. With SOMEONE at his side, he backs through a small courtyard. 

IN_TIME_DVS422
00:45:23,00 --> 00:45:34,50
Turning, he pulls through a corridor and out onto the front driveway. The Roadster passes several timekeeper cars as the authorities rush out through the front door. 

IN_TIME_DVS423
00:45:31,00 --> 00:45:38,50
As SOMEONE and his hostage speed away, the timekeeper cars follow. 

IN_TIME_DVS424
00:45:35,00 --> 00:45:44,50
As their sirens sound, white bars of light repeatedly extend across their grills and upper windshields. 

IN_TIME_DVS425
00:45:43,00 --> 00:45:52,50
The Roadster turns out to a quiet road, forcing an arriving timekeeper car to veer to one side. 

IN_TIME_DVS426
00:45:49,00 --> 00:45:54,50
The others pass it in their pursuit. 

IN_TIME_DVS427
00:45:51,00 --> 00:45:59,50
Now, as they chase SOMEONE's car across an overpass, SOMEONE looks over her shoulder. 

IN_TIME_DVS428
00:45:59,00 --> 00:46:05,50
One of the pursuing cars moves to the front and tails them aggressively. 

IN_TIME_DVS429
00:46:03,00 --> 00:46:08,50
SOMEONE weaves the Roadster through the traffic. 

IN_TIME_DVS430
00:46:06,00 --> 00:46:10,50
The car stays on his tail. 

IN_TIME_DVS431
00:46:08,00 --> 00:46:14,50
At the wheel, SOMEONE drives with narrowed eyes and pursed lips. 

IN_TIME_DVS432
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:19,50
Lowering his chin, he braces himself and rams the Roadster's rear bumper. 

IN_TIME_DVS433
00:46:17,00 --> 00:46:28,50
The small convertible spins out and stops, facing SOMEONE's front end. SOMEONE jerks the gearshift and reverses down the street at high speed. 

IN_TIME_DVS434
00:46:32,00 --> 00:46:49,50
SOMEONE veers into the oncoming lane and swerves around the approaching cars. Maintaining a close pursuit, SOMEONE blinks his large eyes and sets his jaw tight. SOMEONE's auburn hair blows across her face as she stares slack-jawed at the oncoming traffic. 

IN_TIME_DVS435
00:46:48,00 --> 00:46:58,50
A huge truck heads straight for them. SOMEONE wrenches the wheel, spinning the Roadster out of its path and back in the right direction. 

IN_TIME_DVS436
00:46:55,00 --> 00:47:02,50
SOMEONE tries to turn his car out of the way but the truck crashes through its rear half. 

IN_TIME_DVS437
00:47:00,00 --> 00:47:08,50
As SOMEONE makes his escape with SOMEONE, the timekeeper catches his breath and glares after them with gritted teeth. 

IN_TIME_DVS438
00:47:05,00 --> 00:47:12,50
SOMEONE glances at his hostage, looks over his shoulder, and smirks. 

IN_TIME_DVS439
00:47:10,00 --> 00:47:21,50
Now in a deserted area, two timekeeper cars speed across another overpass. Below, the Roadster turns in beneath the structure. 

IN_TIME_DVS440
00:47:19,00 --> 00:47:25,50
SOMEONE checks his body clock which shows an hour and ten minutes. 

IN_TIME_DVS441
00:47:25,00 --> 00:47:31,50
SOMEONE smacks his hand away and avoids his gaze. 

IN_TIME_DVS442
00:47:53,00 --> 00:47:57,50
SOMEONE looks down. 

IN_TIME_DVS443
00:47:56,00 --> 00:48:00,50
She pulls up her long glove. 

IN_TIME_DVS444
00:47:59,00 --> 00:48:07,50
Now, in bright sunlight, the Roadster speeds along a multilevel network of roads by the river basin. 

IN_TIME_DVS445
00:48:05,00 --> 00:48:11,50
At the wheel, SOMEONE looks up at a posted video camera trained on the road. 

IN_TIME_DVS446
00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:16,50
As he turns his head to stare at it, the Roadster approaches a spike strip laid across the street. 

IN_TIME_DVS447
00:48:14,00 --> 00:48:19,50
It blows out the car's tires. 

IN_TIME_DVS448
00:48:17,00 --> 00:48:28,50
Losing control, SOMEONE leans forward and protectively pushes SOMEONE's head down. The car careens off the road and tumbles end over end into the basin. 

IN_TIME_DVS449
00:48:26,00 --> 00:48:32,50
It settles on its wheels, both occupants slumped and motionless. 

IN_TIME_DVS450
00:48:29,00 --> 00:48:34,50
SOMEONE and his men arrive. 

IN_TIME_DVS451
00:48:41,00 --> 00:48:47,50
As his men surround the car, SOMEONE leans over SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS452
00:48:55,00 --> 00:48:59,50
A young thug checks her. 

IN_TIME_DVS453
00:49:02,00 --> 00:49:10,50
SOMEONE pushes past his men and grabs SOMEONE's arm. He faces his underlings defensively. 

IN_TIME_DVS454
00:49:12,00 --> 00:49:17,50
A timekeeper car drives past. 

IN_TIME_DVS455
00:49:14,00 --> 00:49:20,50
As his thugs head for their car, SOMEONE lingers. 

IN_TIME_DVS456
00:49:20,00 --> 00:49:27,50
He releases the heiress, pounds the car with his fist, and joins his men. 

IN_TIME_DVS457
00:49:24,00 --> 00:49:29,50
SOMEONE's head twitches groggily. 

IN_TIME_DVS458
00:49:26,00 --> 00:49:33,50
The gangster's car speeds off down the depleted river basin. 

IN_TIME_DVS459
00:49:30,00 --> 00:49:36,50
In the Roadster, SOMEONE stirs weakly then wakes. 

IN_TIME_DVS460
00:49:33,00 --> 00:49:40,50
She eyes her body clock which ticks down under 32 minutes. 

IN_TIME_DVS461
00:49:37,00 --> 00:49:43,50
Beside her, SOMEONE sits up clutching his head painfully. 

IN_TIME_DVS462
00:49:40,00 --> 00:49:47,50
He faces his companion and gently turns her face with his hand. 

IN_TIME_DVS463
00:49:59,00 --> 00:50:03,50
She leaves the car. 

IN_TIME_DVS464
00:50:02,00 --> 00:50:07,50
SOMEONE climbs out through his mangled door. 

IN_TIME_DVS465
00:50:18,00 --> 00:50:24,50
He grabs her forearm and gives her a few minutes. 

IN_TIME_DVS466
00:50:26,00 --> 00:50:30,50
She flings his hand away. 

IN_TIME_DVS467
00:50:33,00 --> 00:50:39,50
SOMEONE takes SOMEONE's gloved hand and they run off down the basin. 

IN_TIME_DVS468
00:50:37,00 --> 00:50:45,50
Now, on the road adjacent to its slope, a timekeeper's cruiser breaks hard, its tires smoking. 

IN_TIME_DVS469
00:50:42,00 --> 00:50:48,50
It backs up quickly and lurches to a halt. 

IN_TIME_DVS470
00:50:45,00 --> 00:50:51,50
At the wheel, SOMEONE gazes down at the wrecked Roadster. 

IN_TIME_DVS471
00:50:48,00 --> 00:50:55,50
Later, he raises a scanner by his seat and sticks his wrist through it. 

IN_TIME_DVS472
00:50:57,00 --> 00:51:04,50
His body clock indicates a transfer of time into his body and he leaves the car. 

IN_TIME_DVS473
00:51:10,00 --> 00:51:17,50
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and their blond colleague surround the mangled Roadster. 

IN_TIME_DVS474
00:51:30,00 --> 00:51:35,50
SOMEONE perches serenely on the Roadster's hood. 

IN_TIME_DVS475
00:51:33,00 --> 00:51:39,50
Now, SOMEONE and SOMEONE run hand in hand through the ghetto. 

IN_TIME_DVS476
00:51:37,00 --> 00:51:44,50
Reaching SOMEONE's apartment complex, they dash up the steps to his unit. 

IN_TIME_DVS477
00:51:42,00 --> 00:51:50,50
SOMEONE stands by as SOMEONE raises a fist to a screen door fitted with protective iron bars. 

IN_TIME_DVS478
00:51:51,00 --> 00:51:57,50
SOMEONE's clock shows three and a half minutes left. 

IN_TIME_DVS479
00:51:56,00 --> 00:52:02,50
The inner door opens and SOMEONE's wife stares out. 

IN_TIME_DVS480
00:52:00,00 --> 00:52:05,50
She vacantly opens the screen door. 

IN_TIME_DVS481
00:52:16,00 --> 00:52:21,50
Greta averts her tearful gaze. 

IN_TIME_DVS482
00:52:23,00 --> 00:52:33,50
She withdraws into the apartment, shutting the doors. As SOMEONE beats the screen door, SOMEONE notes two and a half minutes left on her clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS483
00:52:38,00 --> 00:52:43,50
SOMEONE paces, then faces SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS484
00:52:40,00 --> 00:52:47,50
Brushing her hair back, he finds a sizable diamond stud on her earlobe. 

IN_TIME_DVS485
00:52:47,00 --> 00:52:58,50
He grabs her hand and leads her down the steps. They race down a deserted road and approach a building with a sign over the entrance reading simply Pawn. 

IN_TIME_DVS486
00:52:55,00 --> 00:53:00,50
Its metal security gate lowers. 

IN_TIME_DVS487
00:53:01,00 --> 00:53:06,50
SOMEONE sticks his foot under the gate. 

IN_TIME_DVS488
00:53:06,00 --> 00:53:12,50
SOMEONE's clock reads less than a minute. SOMEONE removes her earrings. 

IN_TIME_DVS489
00:53:10,00 --> 00:53:14,50
She tosses them under the gate. 

IN_TIME_DVS490
00:53:12,00 --> 00:53:17,50
It rises, revealing an additional grated gate behind it. 

IN_TIME_DVS491
00:53:15,00 --> 00:53:23,50
From the other side, a woman trains a shotgun on the pair while a man with long bangs examines the earrings. 

IN_TIME_DVS492
00:53:20,00 --> 00:53:26,50
He notices less than a minute on SOMEONE's clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS493
00:53:32,00 --> 00:53:36,50
SOMEONE sticks his hand through the gate. 

IN_TIME_DVS494
00:53:34,00 --> 00:53:40,50
The broker transfers the time to him, then yanks his hand back. 

IN_TIME_DVS495
00:53:37,00 --> 00:53:41,50
The gate lowers. 

IN_TIME_DVS496
00:53:40,00 --> 00:53:46,50
SOMEONE clamps a hand over SOMEONE's mouth. Later, they hide. 

IN_TIME_DVS497
00:53:45,00 --> 00:53:52,50
As a timekeeper's car passes, SOMEONE transfers half his time to SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS498
00:53:49,00 --> 00:53:54,50
They watch their own clocks, then release each other. 

IN_TIME_DVS499
00:53:55,00 --> 00:53:59,50
On the street. 

IN_TIME_DVS500
00:54:00,00 --> 00:54:04,50
They pass a Weis Time Lenders. 

IN_TIME_DVS501
00:54:15,00 --> 00:54:21,50
He guides her to a bank of pay phones and picks up a receiver. 

IN_TIME_DVS502
00:54:21,00 --> 00:54:25,50
He scans his wrist. 

IN_TIME_DVS503
00:54:25,00 --> 00:54:29,50
SOMEONE gives him a stubborn look 

IN_TIME_DVS504
00:54:26,00 --> 00:54:31,50
and he turns his head toward the keypad. 

IN_TIME_DVS505
00:54:28,00 --> 00:54:33,50
She dials sulkily. 

IN_TIME_DVS506
00:54:30,00 --> 00:54:35,50
SOMEONE corners her against a wall as he listens. 

IN_TIME_DVS507
00:54:33,00 --> 00:54:37,50
Meanwhile, in SOMEONE's study. 

IN_TIME_DVS508
00:54:36,00 --> 00:54:41,50
SOMEONE gives a nod and SOMEONE answers. 

IN_TIME_DVS509
00:54:44,00 --> 00:54:48,50
SOMEONE holds out the phone. 

IN_TIME_DVS510
00:54:45,00 --> 00:54:51,50
Taking it, SOMEONE casually leans against SOMEONE's desk. 

IN_TIME_DVS511
00:54:57,00 --> 00:55:04,50
SOMEONE gazes at a building's neon sign which reads Mission Out of Time. 

IN_TIME_DVS512
00:55:07,00 --> 00:55:12,50
Shaking his head, SOMEONE moves away from SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS513
00:55:33,00 --> 00:55:39,50
With a puzzled look, SOMEONE lowers the receiver and hangs it up. 

IN_TIME_DVS514
00:55:37,00 --> 00:55:42,50
The blond timekeeper traces the call. 

IN_TIME_DVS515
00:55:42,00 --> 00:55:47,50
He returns the phone to SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS516
00:55:48,00 --> 00:55:53,50
He stares off. Michele eyes him. 

IN_TIME_DVS517
00:55:58,00 --> 00:56:01,50
Back in Dayton. 

IN_TIME_DVS518
00:56:10,00 --> 00:56:17,50
With his gun at her back, he shuffles her past a timed out woman lying in the street. 

IN_TIME_DVS520
00:56:15,00 --> 00:56:21,50
SOMEONE follows SOMEONE up a fire escape to a balcony. 

IN_TIME_DVS521
00:56:18,00 --> 00:56:25,50
Opening a window, he climbs into the building where he lived with his mother. 

IN_TIME_DVS522
00:56:26,00 --> 00:56:30,50
SOMEONE climbs in after him. 

IN_TIME_DVS523
00:56:30,00 --> 00:56:38,50
He turns on a light over a sink and runs water over his bloody knuckles. SOMEONE looks around. 

IN_TIME_DVS524
00:56:37,00 --> 00:56:43,50
SOMEONE drinks from the tap, wipes his mouth, then shuts off the faucet. 

IN_TIME_DVS525
00:56:47,00 --> 00:56:54,50
Now, in the bathroom, SOMEONE zips herself into a modest short-sleeved dress. 

IN_TIME_DVS526
00:56:51,00 --> 00:56:58,50
On her left arm, she wears an evening glove with its fingers cut off. 

IN_TIME_DVS527
00:56:55,00 --> 00:57:02,50
Gazing at herself in a small mirror, she adjusts her straight auburn hair. 

IN_TIME_DVS528
00:56:59,00 --> 00:57:05,50
In the adjacent room, SOMEONE puts on a long-sleeved shirt. 

IN_TIME_DVS529
00:57:04,00 --> 00:57:10,50
Later, he gazes out a window at the Mission's neon sign. 

IN_TIME_DVS530
00:57:11,00 --> 00:57:17,50
Its status still reads Out of time. 

IN_TIME_DVS531
00:57:14,00 --> 00:57:20,50
He turns from the window as SOMEONE joins him in the living room. 

IN_TIME_DVS532
00:57:23,00 --> 00:57:28,50
SOMEONE drops her gaze to her outfit. 

IN_TIME_DVS533
00:57:29,00 --> 00:57:36,50
He sets the gun on a table, then pours the champagne from his mother's birthday. 

IN_TIME_DVS534
00:57:40,00 --> 00:57:45,50
SOMEONE sits on the edge of the couch. 

IN_TIME_DVS535
00:57:49,00 --> 00:57:53,50
She gazes up at him. 

IN_TIME_DVS536
00:57:51,00 --> 00:57:57,50
Setting down his drink, SOMEONE sits on the couch and faces her. 

IN_TIME_DVS537
00:57:54,00 --> 00:58:00,50
As he rolls up his sleeve, SOMEONE puts her drink on the floor. 

IN_TIME_DVS538
00:57:59,00 --> 00:58:04,50
She gives him an uneasy look, then extends her arm. 

IN_TIME_DVS539
00:58:02,00 --> 00:58:06,50
They clasp each other's wrists. 

IN_TIME_DVS540
00:58:22,00 --> 00:58:29,50
SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE's clock which counts down from seven seconds. 

IN_TIME_DVS541
00:58:28,00 --> 00:58:34,50
He gently twists her arm until his hand is on top. 

IN_TIME_DVS542
00:58:31,00 --> 00:58:39,50
She watches as his balance ticks back up to 16 hours, 9 minutes, and 59 seconds. 

IN_TIME_DVS543
00:58:36,00 --> 00:58:41,50
Lifting her gaze to SOMEONE's, she holds 

IN_TIME_DVS544
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:42,50
it intently, 

IN_TIME_DVS545
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:46,50
then releases his wrist and slides hers out of his grasp. 

IN_TIME_DVS546
00:58:46,00 --> 00:58:51,50
She slides the glove over her clock. SOMEONE lowers his sleeve. 

IN_TIME_DVS548
00:58:59,00 --> 00:59:05,50
he sips from his mug of champagne. SOMEONE considers him. 

IN_TIME_DVS549
00:59:07,00 --> 00:59:12,50
She stares with inviting eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS550
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:15,50
He twitches a smile. 

IN_TIME_DVS551
00:59:15,00 --> 00:59:21,50
In a flashback, SOMEONE trips forward as he walks. 

IN_TIME_DVS552
00:59:29,00 --> 00:59:34,50
SOMEONE stares sadly. 

IN_TIME_DVS553
00:59:36,00 --> 00:59:41,50
A flashback shows her in bed. 

IN_TIME_DVS554
00:59:38,00 --> 00:59:42,50
She shudders. 

IN_TIME_DVS555
00:59:39,00 --> 00:59:47,50
As her clock begins to count down, SOMEONE lifts her head off the pillow and gazes at it. 

IN_TIME_DVS556
00:59:44,00 --> 00:59:50,50
She runs her finger over the glowing numbers. 

IN_TIME_DVS557
00:59:54,00 --> 00:59:58,50
Touching her face, she examines it. 

IN_TIME_DVS558
00:59:59,00 --> 01:00:03,50
In the present. 

IN_TIME_DVS559
01:00:02,00 --> 01:00:06,50
She averts her eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS560
01:00:06,00 --> 01:00:10,50
SOMEONE gives a surprised look. 

IN_TIME_DVS561
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:22,50
He grabs two guns off the table, tucking one into the back of his waistband as he strides out of the room. 

IN_TIME_DVS562
01:00:21,00 --> 01:00:27,50
SOMEONE stares off with woeful eyes. Morning. 

IN_TIME_DVS563
01:00:24,00 --> 01:00:29,50
Standing at the window facing the Mission, 

IN_TIME_DVS564
01:00:26,00 --> 01:00:31,50
SOMEONE sees a line gathering outside. 

IN_TIME_DVS565
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:35,50
He turns to SOMEONE, who sleeps on the couch, and loads his gun. 

IN_TIME_DVS566
01:00:33,00 --> 01:00:37,50
She wakes. 

IN_TIME_DVS567
01:00:36,00 --> 01:00:40,50
He returns his gaze to the window. 

IN_TIME_DVS568
01:00:40,00 --> 01:00:44,50
SOMEONE joins him. 

IN_TIME_DVS569
01:00:41,00 --> 01:00:48,50
As the Mission's door opens and a man emerges, she sucks in an anxious breath. 

IN_TIME_DVS570
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:52,50
The neon letters on the sign flicker, then glow steadily. 

IN_TIME_DVS571
01:00:49,00 --> 01:00:53,50
Out of time. 

IN_TIME_DVS572
01:00:50,00 --> 01:00:58,50
The crowd outside disperses and the Mission proprietor heads back inside. 

IN_TIME_DVS573
01:00:58,00 --> 01:01:03,50
SOMEONE lowers his gaze and clenches his jaw. 

IN_TIME_DVS574
01:01:01,00 --> 01:01:08,50
He glances at SOMEONE, who gives him a sidelong look then shifts away her crestfallen eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS575
01:01:07,00 --> 01:01:11,50
His expression softens. 

IN_TIME_DVS576
01:01:21,00 --> 01:01:26,50
SOMEONE considers her, then turns back to the window. 

IN_TIME_DVS577
01:01:26,00 --> 01:01:30,50
He shrugs his brow. 

IN_TIME_DVS578
01:01:37,00 --> 01:01:41,50
She checks her clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS579
01:01:41,00 --> 01:01:45,50
They move from the window. 

IN_TIME_DVS580
01:01:47,00 --> 01:01:53,50
Now, SOMEONE holds SOMEONE's arm as he escorts her down a sidewalk. 

IN_TIME_DVS581
01:01:51,00 --> 01:01:56,50
His other hand rests on a gun at the front of his waistband. 

IN_TIME_DVS582
01:02:16,00 --> 01:02:21,50
She holds his gaze with solemn eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS583
01:02:27,00 --> 01:02:33,50
He takes the gun hidden at his back and places her hand around it. 

IN_TIME_DVS584
01:02:36,00 --> 01:02:40,50
She gives him a tender look, 

IN_TIME_DVS585
01:02:37,00 --> 01:02:43,50
then takes a few steps toward the pay phone across the street. 

IN_TIME_DVS586
01:02:40,00 --> 01:02:47,50
Turning back, she places her hand against SOMEONE's neck and pulls him into a kiss. 

IN_TIME_DVS587
01:02:45,00 --> 01:02:51,50
He slides his arm around her waist and she clutches the front of his shirt. 

IN_TIME_DVS588
01:02:51,00 --> 01:02:58,50
As their kiss ends, SOMEONE lets her lips graze against his, then strides away. 

IN_TIME_DVS589
01:02:57,00 --> 01:03:06,50
With his gun in one hand, SOMEONE sits on a street corner's curb, scanning the area as SOMEONE dials at a pay phone. 

IN_TIME_DVS590
01:03:08,00 --> 01:03:14,50
A timekeeper's cruiser rolls up behind SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS591
01:03:11,00 --> 01:03:16,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE answers his phone. 

IN_TIME_DVS592
01:03:20,00 --> 01:03:26,50
Climbing out of the cruiser, SOMEONE approaches the oblivious SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS593
01:03:24,00 --> 01:03:28,50
He raises a gun. 

IN_TIME_DVS594
01:03:32,00 --> 01:03:36,50
She spots SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS595
01:03:35,00 --> 01:03:44,50
She fires her gun. SOMEONE releases his weapon as he falls back. SOMEONE lowers his phone from his ear and gazes at it. 

IN_TIME_DVS596
01:03:41,00 --> 01:03:54,50
Striding up to SOMEONE, SOMEONE kicks the timekeeper's gun aside. SOMEONE retrieves it as SOMEONE holds SOMEONE down with one knee and presses his gun to his chest. He checks the timekeeper's clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS597
01:03:59,00 --> 01:04:06,50
Grinning, SOMEONE clasps SOMEONE's right wrist and twists it into receiving position. 

IN_TIME_DVS598
01:04:05,00 --> 01:04:09,50
He stands. 

IN_TIME_DVS599
01:04:08,00 --> 01:04:23,50
SOMEONE checks his balance and finds 4 hours and 45 minutes. Tucking his gun into his waistband, SOMEONE climbs into the cruiser's driving seat. As the vehicle peels out, SOMEONE gets to his feet and watches it speed past. 

IN_TIME_DVS600
01:04:23,00 --> 01:04:28,50
Clutching his arm, he heads toward the pay phone. 

IN_TIME_DVS601
01:04:25,00 --> 01:04:30,50
Two Dayton residents spot him 

IN_TIME_DVS602
01:04:27,00 --> 01:04:32,50
and one rips out the phone's receiver. 

IN_TIME_DVS604
01:04:39,00 --> 01:04:43,50
She checks her clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS605
01:04:45,00 --> 01:04:49,50
SOMEONE meets her gaze. 

IN_TIME_DVS606
01:04:58,00 --> 01:05:01,50
With SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS607
01:05:04,00 --> 01:05:11,50
SOMEONE pushes past the disgruntled Dayton residents gathering around him. 

IN_TIME_DVS608
01:05:17,00 --> 01:05:24,50
Now, SOMEONE totes a gun as he approaches the group surrounding SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS609
01:05:22,00 --> 01:05:27,50
The injured timekeeper emerges. 

IN_TIME_DVS610
01:05:27,00 --> 01:05:32,50
He sees SOMEONE's extra time. 

IN_TIME_DVS611
01:05:30,00 --> 01:05:36,50
Ignoring him, SOMEONE heads to the passenger side of SOMEONE's cruiser. 

IN_TIME_DVS612
01:05:33,00 --> 01:05:39,50
They get in and SOMEONE backs away from the crowd. 

IN_TIME_DVS613
01:05:38,00 --> 01:05:45,50
Now, SOMEONE and SOMEONE wait in their stolen vehicle which sits parked on a side street. 

IN_TIME_DVS614
01:05:48,00 --> 01:05:52,50
SOMEONE gives a thoughtful look. 

IN_TIME_DVS615
01:05:53,00 --> 01:06:01,50
He swerves around a corner onto a main road and halts the cruiser directly across a limousine's path. 

IN_TIME_DVS616
01:05:58,00 --> 01:06:03,50
The luxury vehicle rolls to a stop. 

IN_TIME_DVS617
01:06:01,00 --> 01:06:08,50
Toting his gun, SOMEONE climbs out of the cruiser and strides to the limo driver's side. 

IN_TIME_DVS618
01:06:05,00 --> 01:06:10,50
He taps his weapon on the window. 

IN_TIME_DVS619
01:06:08,00 --> 01:06:13,50
The chauffeur rolls it down and gazes out. 

IN_TIME_DVS620
01:06:17,00 --> 01:06:21,50
He points the gun inside. 

IN_TIME_DVS621
01:06:22,00 --> 01:06:26,50
The chauffeur shakes his head. 

IN_TIME_DVS622
01:06:26,00 --> 01:06:31,50
SOMEONE shoots at the vehicle. 

IN_TIME_DVS623
01:06:29,00 --> 01:06:34,50
SOMEONE ducks and glares at his partner. 

IN_TIME_DVS624
01:06:35,00 --> 01:06:41,50
With a fearful look, the chauffeur pops open a back door. 

IN_TIME_DVS625
01:06:38,00 --> 01:06:44,50
SOMEONE holds it open as a blond woman steps out. 

IN_TIME_DVS626
01:06:43,00 --> 01:06:48,50
She wears a fur coat over her black dress. 

IN_TIME_DVS627
01:07:05,00 --> 01:07:11,50
He glances at SOMEONE, then eyes the woman's earrings. 

IN_TIME_DVS628
01:07:09,00 --> 01:07:13,50
She gives them to him. 

IN_TIME_DVS629
01:07:10,00 --> 01:07:18,50
He moves to SOMEONE, who keeps her gun aimed at the blond and sets the earrings in her palm. 

IN_TIME_DVS630
01:07:21,00 --> 01:07:26,50
He aims his gun at the chauffeur. 

IN_TIME_DVS631
01:07:23,00 --> 01:07:28,50
Later, he and SOMEONE take off in the limo. 

IN_TIME_DVS632
01:07:25,00 --> 01:07:30,50
Now parked, they watch a news report. 

IN_TIME_DVS633
01:07:39,00 --> 01:07:44,50
SOMEONE turns off the TV. SOMEONE shoots him a glance. 

IN_TIME_DVS634
01:07:45,00 --> 01:07:50,50
SOMEONE gestures at the television. 

IN_TIME_DVS635
01:07:56,00 --> 01:08:00,50
SOMEONE allows a smile. 

IN_TIME_DVS636
01:08:02,00 --> 01:08:07,50
Looking out her window, she suppresses a smile. 

IN_TIME_DVS637
01:08:13,00 --> 01:08:17,50
She meets his gaze. 

IN_TIME_DVS638
01:08:24,00 --> 01:08:28,50
She turns away. 

IN_TIME_DVS639
01:08:34,00 --> 01:08:41,50
As he gazes at her, she lifts her eyes to his with a meaningful look. 

IN_TIME_DVS640
01:08:38,00 --> 01:08:43,50
He leans closer and presses his lips to hers. 

IN_TIME_DVS641
01:08:41,00 --> 01:08:49,50
Outside, a willow's canopy rustles in a gentle breeze as it shelters the stolen car. 

IN_TIME_DVS642
01:08:47,00 --> 01:08:51,50
Now, in his office, 

IN_TIME_DVS643
01:08:48,00 --> 01:08:56,50
SOMEONE eyes a wall-sized digital map which displays the world's time zones. 

IN_TIME_DVS644
01:08:53,00 --> 01:08:57,50
He talks on a speaker phone. 

IN_TIME_DVS645
01:09:11,00 --> 01:09:17,50
As SOMEONE enters, SOMEONE takes the phone off speaker. 

IN_TIME_DVS646
01:09:18,00 --> 01:09:26,50
He hangs up, then shifts his gaze to SOMEONE, who examines the data tables on the digital map. 

IN_TIME_DVS647
01:09:34,00 --> 01:09:39,50
He turns to SOMEONE, who shrugs his hands. 

IN_TIME_DVS648
01:10:14,00 --> 01:10:20,50
SOMEONE blinks at the businessman, his face relaxed in a deadpan expression. 

IN_TIME_DVS649
01:10:18,00 --> 01:10:23,50
SOMEONE unbuttons a cuff and adjusts his sleeve. 

IN_TIME_DVS650
01:10:31,00 --> 01:10:36,50
Shrugging his lips, SOMEONE nods. 

IN_TIME_DVS651
01:10:42,00 --> 01:10:48,50
SOMEONE lowers his gaze from the timekeeper, 

IN_TIME_DVS652
01:10:45,00 --> 01:10:51,50
then pushes his chair out from his desk and stands. 

IN_TIME_DVS653
01:10:50,00 --> 01:10:53,50
He smirks. 

IN_TIME_DVS654
01:10:51,00 --> 01:10:55,50
SOMEONE's stare remains firm. 

IN_TIME_DVS655
01:11:12,00 --> 01:11:16,50
SOMEONE strolls off. 

IN_TIME_DVS656
01:11:13,00 --> 01:11:18,50
Now, SOMEONE teaches SOMEONE how to shoot. 

IN_TIME_DVS657
01:11:23,00 --> 01:11:29,50
With SOMEONE behind her, SOMEONE aims the gun, 

IN_TIME_DVS658
01:11:27,00 --> 01:11:33,50
cringes as it goes off. SOMEONE gently takes the gun from her. 

IN_TIME_DVS659
01:11:33,00 --> 01:11:40,50
SOMEONE faces him and lingers close, her gaze lowered coyly. 

IN_TIME_DVS660
01:11:48,00 --> 01:11:53,50
SOMEONE gazes off thoughtfully. 

IN_TIME_DVS661
01:11:58,00 --> 01:12:03,50
SOMEONE lifts her gaze to meet his. 

IN_TIME_DVS662
01:12:01,00 --> 01:12:07,50
Bending one leg, she plants the toe of her shoe in the dirt. 

IN_TIME_DVS663
01:12:04,00 --> 01:12:09,50
The heiress smiles briefly, 

IN_TIME_DVS664
01:12:06,00 --> 01:12:11,50
then steps back and shifts on her feet. 

IN_TIME_DVS665
01:12:10,00 --> 01:12:16,50
SOMEONE's lips curl into a curious smirk 

IN_TIME_DVS666
01:12:13,00 --> 01:12:18,50
and SOMEONE beams mischievously. 

IN_TIME_DVS667
01:12:15,00 --> 01:12:21,50
Now, at Weis Time Lenders, a pretty woman faces a teller. 

IN_TIME_DVS668
01:12:28,00 --> 01:12:32,50
He cocks an eyebrow. 

IN_TIME_DVS669
01:12:29,00 --> 01:12:41,50
The customers scatter as a truck barrels through the bank's glass walls. It smashes through the glass barriers inside and stops at an open vault. 

IN_TIME_DVS670
01:12:38,00 --> 01:12:45,50
Drawing their guns, SOMEONE and SOMEONE get out of the truck and hurry into the vault. 

IN_TIME_DVS671
01:12:42,00 --> 01:12:51,50
SOMEONE opens a large suitcase on the floor and they hurriedly fill it with time capsules from the surrounding shelves. 

IN_TIME_DVS672
01:12:50,00 --> 01:12:55,50
Crouching, SOMEONE shuts the sizable case. 

IN_TIME_DVS673
01:12:55,00 --> 01:13:00,50
They pause and face the staring customers. 

IN_TIME_DVS674
01:13:13,00 --> 01:13:19,50
As the pair leaves, the customers rush into the vault and clean it out. 

IN_TIME_DVS675
01:13:17,00 --> 01:13:27,50
Now, capsules fall onto pavement littered with broken glass as the ghetto citizens drain the capsule's time into their bodies. 

IN_TIME_DVS676
01:13:24,00 --> 01:13:33,50
At the arrival of two timekeeper cruisers, a few drop their empty capsules and stroll off with affected nonchalance. 

IN_TIME_DVS677
01:13:31,00 --> 01:13:37,50
Many others linger on the spot staring at the authorities. 

IN_TIME_DVS678
01:13:34,00 --> 01:13:39,50
SOMEONE' car drives by. 

IN_TIME_DVS679
01:13:36,00 --> 01:13:44,50
Riding shotgun, the gang leader stares wide-eyed at the newly-empowered citizens. 

IN_TIME_DVS680
01:13:42,00 --> 01:13:49,50
SOMEONE gets out of his car, faces the plundered vault, and addresses the staring crowd. 

IN_TIME_DVS681
01:13:54,00 --> 01:14:03,50
The citizens by the building step away but the crowd lingers. SOMEONE approaches the destroyed window trailed by his men. 

IN_TIME_DVS682
01:14:03,00 --> 01:14:07,50
Now, in her complex's courtyard, Greta hangs laundry to dry on a line. 

IN_TIME_DVS683
01:14:05,00 --> 01:14:10,50
Taking a garment from her basket, she pauses and stares inside. 

IN_TIME_DVS684
01:14:07,00 --> 01:14:14,50
She pulls out a time capsule and looks around. 

IN_TIME_DVS685
01:14:11,00 --> 01:14:17,50
As she reads the display, her breath quickens and her brow furrows. 

IN_TIME_DVS687
01:14:19,00 --> 01:14:22,50
as SOMEONE sleeps in a large concrete pipe, 

IN_TIME_DVS688
01:14:20,00 --> 01:14:25,50
SOMEONE arrives and takes her capsule. 

IN_TIME_DVS689
01:14:22,00 --> 01:14:27,50
He deposits time from his own body, 

IN_TIME_DVS690
01:14:25,00 --> 01:14:30,50
then returns it to the sleeping child and slips away. 

IN_TIME_DVS691
01:14:27,00 --> 01:14:33,50
Now, at the Mission, 

IN_TIME_DVS692
01:14:30,00 --> 01:14:34,50
a masked SOMEONE holds up its young, long-haired proprietor. 

IN_TIME_DVS693
01:14:32,00 --> 01:14:38,50
Holding him at gunpoint, SOMEONE transfers time into his body. 

IN_TIME_DVS694
01:14:42,00 --> 01:14:49,50
The proprietor stares slack-jawed at his clock 

IN_TIME_DVS695
01:14:46,00 --> 01:14:52,50
and smiles faintly as his balance ticks past a century. 

IN_TIME_DVS696
01:14:49,00 --> 01:14:55,50
Now, the words Out Of blink of on his neon sign, leaving only Time illuminated. 

IN_TIME_DVS697
01:14:52,00 --> 01:15:00,50
Citizens hurry over and line up as the proprietor doles out his newly acquired wealth. 

IN_TIME_DVS698
01:14:58,00 --> 01:15:05,50
At the timekeeper's headquarters. 

IN_TIME_DVS699
01:15:03,00 --> 01:15:07,50
Using a phone, SOMEONE faces the time map. 

IN_TIME_DVS700
01:15:06,00 --> 01:15:11,50
Zone 12 shines in amber amidst the surrounding green zones. 

IN_TIME_DVS701
01:15:10,00 --> 01:15:16,50
SOMEONE ends the call and faces SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS702
01:15:16,00 --> 01:15:21,50
In the ghetto, a tall young man with deep-set eyes walks down a deserted street. 

IN_TIME_DVS703
01:15:22,00 --> 01:15:29,50
He stops and smirks fearlessly as the minutemen's car stops in his path. 

IN_TIME_DVS704
01:15:26,00 --> 01:15:33,50
Boasting over four weeks, the man draws a gun. 

IN_TIME_DVS705
01:15:38,00 --> 01:15:44,50
As SOMEONE backs off, the young man smiles triumphantly and nods. 

IN_TIME_DVS706
01:15:43,00 --> 01:15:49,50
The minutemen get in their car and drive past him. 

IN_TIME_DVS707
01:15:47,00 --> 01:15:52,50
As the man moves on, the car halts and backs up. 

IN_TIME_DVS708
01:15:49,00 --> 01:15:55,50
As it heads back toward the defiant young man, 

IN_TIME_DVS710
01:15:56,00 --> 01:16:03,50
SOMEONE leans out the passenger window and aims a gun at his back. The man collapses. 

IN_TIME_DVS711
01:16:02,00 --> 01:16:06,50
The man collapses. 

IN_TIME_DVS712
01:16:03,00 --> 01:16:09,50
SOMEONE gets out, approaches him, and aims again.  

IN_TIME_DVS713
01:16:06,00 --> 01:16:13,50
Finding his victim's clock frozen in inky numbers, SOMEONE lowers his weapon.  

IN_TIME_DVS714
01:16:11,00 --> 01:16:19,50
Looking up, he spots a billboard featuring SOMEONE and SOMEONE advertising a reward of ten years.  

IN_TIME_DVS715
01:16:21,00 --> 01:16:25,50
Now, SOMEONE watches the news.  

IN_TIME_DVS716
01:16:29,00 --> 01:16:33,50
He turns off the TV. SOMEONE faces him from a doorway. 

IN_TIME_DVS717
01:16:37,00 --> 01:16:41,50
Now, a sign reads No Tell Hotel. Five hours per night. In a seedy room. 

IN_TIME_DVS718
01:16:44,00 --> 01:16:52,50
Now, a sign reads No Tell Hotel. Five hours per night. In a seedy room. Seated facing SOMEONE on a bed. 

IN_TIME_DVS719
01:16:50,00 --> 01:16:59,50
SOMEONE shows a hand of cards. He smiles and she throws them down at her side.  

IN_TIME_DVS720
01:17:02,00 --> 01:17:06,50
He shows his hand.  

IN_TIME_DVS721
01:17:10,00 --> 01:17:16,50
SOMEONE takes SOMEONE's blouse off, lays her down, and leans over her.  

IN_TIME_DVS722
01:17:13,00 --> 01:17:19,50
Outside, timekeepers approach SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS723
01:17:30,00 --> 01:17:34,50
SOMEONE readies his gun. In the room, SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE's neck. 

IN_TIME_DVS725
01:17:35,00 --> 01:17:41,50
He pauses, pushes himself up, and looks to the window. He faces his companion gravely. 

IN_TIME_DVS726
01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:43,50
Peering through blinds, he sees timekeepers approaching. 

IN_TIME_DVS727
01:17:42,00 --> 01:17:47,50
Peering through blinds, he sees timekeepers approaching.  

IN_TIME_DVS728
01:17:44,00 --> 01:17:50,50
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE leave the room, a few arrive in the hall.  

IN_TIME_DVS729
01:17:50,00 --> 01:17:54,50
The break into a nearby room. SOMEONE throws a chair through a window. 

IN_TIME_DVS730
01:17:53,00 --> 01:17:59,50
They land safely on a car below, and race across the deserted back street. They leap from the second story window. 

IN_TIME_DVS731
01:17:58,00 --> 01:18:06,50
The run around the corner of a chain link fence and continue behind a solid wall. 

IN_TIME_DVS733
01:18:10,00 --> 01:18:14,50
SOMEONE and his blond partner watch from the window. 

IN_TIME_DVS734
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:15,50
The two outlaws peek back at them. 

IN_TIME_DVS735
01:18:13,00 --> 01:18:17,50
SOMEONE squeezes past his men and jumps from the window. 

IN_TIME_DVS736
01:18:17,00 --> 01:18:23,50
SOMEONE squeezes past his men and jumps from the window. 

IN_TIME_DVS738
01:18:22,00 --> 01:18:27,50
The couple takes off running. SOMEONE hops down from the car and sprints after them with a methodical gait. 

IN_TIME_DVS739
01:18:24,00 --> 01:18:31,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE reach a more populated area where they pass men in jumpsuits heading to the factory. 

IN_TIME_DVS740
01:18:28,00 --> 01:18:36,50
SOMEONE arrives as well. 

IN_TIME_DVS741
01:18:33,00 --> 01:18:37,50
The outlaws dash down a narrow alley. 

IN_TIME_DVS743
01:18:41,00 --> 01:18:47,50
They climb a fire escape. Behind them, SOMEONE draws his gun.  

IN_TIME_DVS745
01:18:49,00 --> 01:19:03,50
Now, the two outlaws hurry over a tightly-packed network of rooftops. A few buildings behind them, SOMEONE climbs up and resumes his sprint. 

IN_TIME_DVS746
01:19:02,00 --> 01:19:07,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE scurry down a slanted roof. 

IN_TIME_DVS747
01:19:08,00 --> 01:19:12,50
Gaining on them, SOMEONE fires. 

IN_TIME_DVS748
01:19:10,00 --> 01:19:21,50
As SOMEONE races on, SOMEONE shoots back at their pursuer, then follows her. Without breaking his stride, SOMEONE leaps from one rooftop to another. 

IN_TIME_DVS749
01:19:18,00 --> 01:19:28,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE reach the end of the network and face a broad gap at their feet. Drawing near, SOMEONE takes cover and fires at them. 

IN_TIME_DVS750
01:19:26,00 --> 01:19:30,50
SOMEONE shoots back. 

IN_TIME_DVS752
01:19:32,00 --> 01:19:38,50
SOMEONE fires at SOMEONE, who ducks behind a domed bench. 

IN_TIME_DVS753
01:19:36,00 --> 01:19:46,50
SOMEONE slides down a pipe along the building, followed by her partner in crime. Lunging out to shoot, SOMEONE finds them gone. 

IN_TIME_DVS754
01:19:43,00 --> 01:19:53,50
The two outlaws hit the ground and dash hand in hand to a bus. They board and pay their fares. The driver faces a sign picturing them. 

IN_TIME_DVS755
01:19:54,00 --> 01:20:00,50
His side mirror shows SOMEONE sprinting toward the bus. 

IN_TIME_DVS756
01:19:58,00 --> 01:20:09,50
SOMEONE thrusts out his upturned wrist. The driver puts his own on top of it, watches his body clock tally the transfer of time, and welcomes them with a terse nod. 

IN_TIME_DVS757
01:20:07,00 --> 01:20:13,50
The bus pulls away, revealing SOMEONE as he arrives at the curb. 

IN_TIME_DVS758
01:20:11,00 --> 01:20:18,50
On board, SOMEONE and SOMEONE fall into a pair of unoccupied seats and catch their breath. 

IN_TIME_DVS759
01:20:15,00 --> 01:20:20,50
SOMEONE stares after the bus stoically, 

IN_TIME_DVS760
01:20:18,00 --> 01:20:22,50
then turns away. 

IN_TIME_DVS761
01:20:19,00 --> 01:20:26,50
Now, the two outlaws enter a sunlit hotel lobby and approach the desk. 

IN_TIME_DVS762
01:20:39,00 --> 01:20:42,50
He shows his clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS763
01:20:41,00 --> 01:20:48,50
The clerk smiles. A lanky man enters with a suitcase as the outlaws head upstairs. 

IN_TIME_DVS764
01:20:45,00 --> 01:20:52,50
Behind the desk, the clerk pulls her sleeve down over her clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS765
01:20:52,00 --> 01:20:57,50
The traveler gazes after the outlaws. 

IN_TIME_DVS766
01:20:55,00 --> 01:20:59,50
He leaves with a sneer. 

IN_TIME_DVS767
01:20:57,00 --> 01:21:01,50
At night. 

IN_TIME_DVS768
01:20:58,00 --> 01:21:04,50
The minutemen's car pulls up next to a group of guys who scatter. 

IN_TIME_DVS769
01:21:08,00 --> 01:21:15,50
SOMEONE' thugs herd the people into a line with their backs against a fence. 

IN_TIME_DVS770
01:21:14,00 --> 01:21:20,50
Among them, the lanky traveler shifts his angry gaze. 

IN_TIME_DVS771
01:21:23,00 --> 01:21:28,50
SOMEONE holds up a man's body clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS772
01:21:34,00 --> 01:21:39,50
His thugs hold the citizens at gunpoint. 

IN_TIME_DVS773
01:21:37,00 --> 01:21:44,50
SOMEONE steps forward and bends his ear with his finger, then glares at the people. 

IN_TIME_DVS774
01:21:43,00 --> 01:21:48,50
His gaze falls on the man with a month. 

IN_TIME_DVS775
01:21:45,00 --> 01:21:50,50
Shaking his head, SOMEONE turns away. 

IN_TIME_DVS776
01:21:48,00 --> 01:21:53,50
The fedora-wearing thug advances. 

IN_TIME_DVS777
01:21:56,00 --> 01:22:00,50
He depletes the man with a month. 

IN_TIME_DVS778
01:22:03,00 --> 01:22:07,50
His time runs out. 

IN_TIME_DVS779
01:22:06,00 --> 01:22:12,50
As he collapses, SOMEONE tilts his head with a smirk. 

IN_TIME_DVS780
01:22:09,00 --> 01:22:15,50
He faces the man next to the traveler and skips up to him. 

IN_TIME_DVS781
01:22:15,00 --> 01:22:19,50
The traveler steps forward. 

IN_TIME_DVS782
01:22:23,00 --> 01:22:29,50
SOMEONE looks back at the fedora-wearing thug, who lowers his gun. 

IN_TIME_DVS783
01:22:26,00 --> 01:22:33,50
The gang leader steps in close to the traveler and lazily caresses his lapel. 

IN_TIME_DVS784
01:22:33,00 --> 01:22:38,50
He brushes off his shoulder and smirks. 

IN_TIME_DVS785
01:22:37,00 --> 01:22:45,50
Now, on a billboard featuring SOMEONE and SOMEONE, a flickering footer reads Reward: Ten Years. 

IN_TIME_DVS786
01:22:43,00 --> 01:22:48,50
SOMEONE gazes at it through a hotel window. 

IN_TIME_DVS787
01:22:46,00 --> 01:22:53,50
He joins SOMEONE, wrapping an arm around her as she leans against him. 

IN_TIME_DVS788
01:22:53,00 --> 01:23:00,50
Their smiles fade and they gaze off thoughtfully in different directions. 

IN_TIME_DVS789
01:23:11,00 --> 01:23:16,50
SOMEONE's eyes widen and he shakes his head. 

IN_TIME_DVS790
01:23:21,00 --> 01:23:28,50
Smiling faintly, he nuzzles her auburn hair, then shrugs his head. 

IN_TIME_DVS791
01:23:33,00 --> 01:23:38,50
SOMEONE smirks flirtatiously and her companion grins. 

IN_TIME_DVS793
01:23:36,00 --> 01:23:42,50
She turns to face him and they share a tender kiss. 

IN_TIME_DVS794
01:23:41,00 --> 01:23:50,50
The minutemen burst in. Led by the fedora-wearing man, the thugs back SOMEONE up to a wall at gunpoint. 

IN_TIME_DVS795
01:23:47,00 --> 01:23:53,50
SOMEONE sits by SOMEONE and forcefully holds her close. 

IN_TIME_DVS796
01:24:18,00 --> 01:24:23,50
SOMEONE drags SOMEONE across the suite. 

IN_TIME_DVS797
01:24:20,00 --> 01:24:25,50
The fedora-wearing thug pulls SOMEONE along. 

IN_TIME_DVS798
01:24:23,00 --> 01:24:28,50
The minutemen force the couple to sit at a table. 

IN_TIME_DVS799
01:24:47,00 --> 01:24:52,50
SOMEONE hands his gun off to an underling. 

IN_TIME_DVS800
01:25:00,00 --> 01:25:06,50
SOMEONE removes his overcoat then his jacket. 

IN_TIME_DVS801
01:25:03,00 --> 01:25:08,50
Rolling up his shirt sleeve, he sits facing SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS802
01:25:06,00 --> 01:25:11,50
He rests his arms on the table and leans forward. 

IN_TIME_DVS803
01:25:11,00 --> 01:25:20,50
SOMEONE maintains a stoic gaze as the gangster reaches a hand across the table, his palm turned upward. 

IN_TIME_DVS804
01:25:37,00 --> 01:25:44,50
SOMEONE reaches for SOMEONE's leg but she smacks his hand away. 

IN_TIME_DVS805
01:25:43,00 --> 01:25:47,50
He gives a cocky grin. 

IN_TIME_DVS806
01:25:49,00 --> 01:25:55,50
SOMEONE looks to SOMEONE, who shakes her head with wide eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS807
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:59,50
He rolls up his sleeve and lays his arm on the table, showing his clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS808
01:25:56,00 --> 01:26:02,50
As he reaches his other hand out, SOMEONE takes a deep breath. 

IN_TIME_DVS809
01:26:00,00 --> 01:26:09,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE clasp each other's forearms. The gang leader wrenches his arm over SOMEONE's, quickly depleting his time. 

IN_TIME_DVS810
01:26:06,00 --> 01:26:11,50
SOMEONE stares at the men's clocks. 

IN_TIME_DVS811
01:26:09,00 --> 01:26:18,50
SOMEONE gazes steadily at his foe and breathes deeply through flared nostrils. He starts to rotate his arm over the gangster's. 

IN_TIME_DVS812
01:26:16,00 --> 01:26:23,50
SOMEONE lets him teasingly, then wrenches himself back into the upper handed position. 

IN_TIME_DVS813
01:26:21,00 --> 01:26:28,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE's clock. Its balance ticks toward 15 seconds. 

IN_TIME_DVS814
01:26:25,00 --> 01:26:33,50
SOMEONE lifts his chin, smirking triumphantly as he maintains eye contact with his rival. 

IN_TIME_DVS815
01:26:31,00 --> 01:26:36,50
SOMEONE's clock ticks under ten seconds. 

IN_TIME_DVS816
01:26:33,00 --> 01:27:01,50
SOMEONE' eyes dart downward. SOMEONE cocks his head, then claims the upper hand, pinning his opponent's wrist to the table. SOMEONE struggles futilely to free himself, then eyes his rapidly depleting balance. SOMEONE and the thugs lean forward, watching intently. SOMEONE scowls desperately. He watches his clock tick down to ten seconds. Without breaking eye contact with SOMEONE, SOMEONE draws a gun from his boot and shoots the underlings. 

IN_TIME_DVS817
01:26:59,00 --> 01:27:03,50
He aims at SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS818
01:27:04,00 --> 01:27:10,50
The gangster flies back in his chair and falls to the floor. 

IN_TIME_DVS819
01:27:07,00 --> 01:27:13,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE join hands and escape to a dimly lit hallway. 

IN_TIME_DVS820
01:27:12,00 --> 01:27:16,50
They hurry up a stairwell. 

IN_TIME_DVS821
01:27:16,00 --> 01:27:23,50
Now, SOMEONE gazes at the four dead minutemen who lie face down on a sidewalk. 

IN_TIME_DVS822
01:27:25,00 --> 01:27:30,50
SOMEONE blinks, his back to SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS823
01:27:29,00 --> 01:27:35,50
With his hands clasped calmly behind his back, 

IN_TIME_DVS824
01:27:32,00 --> 01:27:39,50
he steps up to SOMEONE, his face mere inches from the other timekeeper's. 

IN_TIME_DVS825
01:27:45,00 --> 01:27:50,50
His cold eyes hold SOMEONE's. 

IN_TIME_DVS826
01:27:49,00 --> 01:27:53,50
He backs off. 

IN_TIME_DVS827
01:27:50,00 --> 01:27:58,50
With his displeased gaze still on SOMEONE, SOMEONE rumples his lips, then turns away. 

IN_TIME_DVS828
01:27:55,00 --> 01:28:00,50
As he and the blond timekeeper stride off, 

IN_TIME_DVS829
01:27:57,00 --> 01:28:04,50
SOMEONE shifts his attention to the bystanders gathered in a wide circle around him. 

IN_TIME_DVS830
01:28:02,00 --> 01:28:07,50
He strolls up to a group of them. 

IN_TIME_DVS832
01:28:14,00 --> 01:28:19,50
SOMEONE leads SOMEONE by the hand across a roof. 

IN_TIME_DVS833
01:28:17,00 --> 01:28:23,50
Reaching a chest-high wall at its edge, they peer down at the street 

IN_TIME_DVS834
01:28:20,00 --> 01:28:27,50
where a digital sign on a storefront displays the time lender's loan rate. 

IN_TIME_DVS835
01:28:24,00 --> 01:28:31,50
They watch it as it ticks up from 33% to 37%. 

IN_TIME_DVS836
01:28:28,00 --> 01:28:32,50
SOMEONE turns away. 

IN_TIME_DVS837
01:28:34,00 --> 01:28:39,50
He stands with his back to SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS838
01:29:05,00 --> 01:29:10,50
She gives him an exasperated look. 

IN_TIME_DVS839
01:29:11,00 --> 01:29:17,50
She stares off thoughtfully, then shifts her eyes back to him. 

IN_TIME_DVS840
01:29:17,00 --> 01:29:22,50
SOMEONE shoots her a questioning glance. 

IN_TIME_DVS842
01:29:20,00 --> 01:29:28,50
Three limos pulled into the semi-circular driveway in front of a towering skyscraper. 

IN_TIME_DVS843
01:29:25,00 --> 01:29:31,50
A cluster of guards waits outside one as SOMEONE climbs out. 

IN_TIME_DVS844
01:29:29,00 --> 01:29:37,50
The suited men surround their charge and the group heads up a broad flight of stairs in the building's lobby. 

IN_TIME_DVS845
01:29:34,00 --> 01:29:40,50
Toting a gun in one hand, SOMEONE strides in after them. 

IN_TIME_DVS846
01:29:38,00 --> 01:29:43,50
SOMEONE spots her. 

IN_TIME_DVS847
01:29:44,00 --> 01:29:49,50
He raises his weapon. The other guards aim at her as well. 

IN_TIME_DVS848
01:29:54,00 --> 01:30:01,50
Pushing aside two guards, SOMEONE emerges from behind their protective wall. 

IN_TIME_DVS849
01:30:00,00 --> 01:30:04,50
She sets her gun on the floor. 

IN_TIME_DVS850
01:30:03,00 --> 01:30:09,50
He stares with wide eyes. She steps closer. 

IN_TIME_DVS851
01:30:08,00 --> 01:30:11,50
She smiles. 

IN_TIME_DVS852
01:30:15,00 --> 01:30:20,50
Among them, SOMEONE aims a gun at SOMEONE's head. 

IN_TIME_DVS853
01:30:18,00 --> 01:30:22,50
SOMEONE gives a shocked look. 

IN_TIME_DVS854
01:30:23,00 --> 01:30:32,50
As the guards set their weapons on the floor, SOMEONE removes his sunglasses. SOMEONE picks up her gun and strides up to her father. 

IN_TIME_DVS855
01:30:30,00 --> 01:30:35,50
Smiling, SOMEONE pulls SOMEONE closer. 

IN_TIME_DVS857
01:30:35,00 --> 01:30:41,50
he emerges from an elevator with SOMEONE at gunpoint. 

IN_TIME_DVS858
01:30:38,00 --> 01:30:45,50
SOMEONE follows. At her father's office, she enters a pass code. 

IN_TIME_DVS859
01:30:47,00 --> 01:30:52,50
SOMEONE guides the businessman inside. 

IN_TIME_DVS860
01:30:49,00 --> 01:30:57,50
He glances at the digital map and data tables as SOMEONE leads them past. 

IN_TIME_DVS861
01:30:54,00 --> 01:31:01,50
Reaching a vault in an adjacent room, he releases SOMEONE and moves to the metal door. 

IN_TIME_DVS862
01:30:58,00 --> 01:31:03,50
SOMEONE trains her gun on her father. 

IN_TIME_DVS863
01:31:17,00 --> 01:31:21,50
SOMEONE turns the vault's dial. 

IN_TIME_DVS864
01:31:21,00 --> 01:31:25,50
SOMEONE looks away. 

IN_TIME_DVS865
01:31:29,00 --> 01:31:34,50
He turns the vault's wheel and heaves the door open. 

IN_TIME_DVS866
01:31:32,00 --> 01:31:38,50
Inside, he finds a lone time capsule on a pedestal. 

IN_TIME_DVS867
01:31:35,00 --> 01:31:39,50
Its time balance reads 

IN_TIME_DVS868
01:31:37,00 --> 01:31:41,50
one million years. 

IN_TIME_DVS869
01:31:38,00 --> 01:31:43,50
SOMEONE stares disbelievingly. 

IN_TIME_DVS870
01:31:40,00 --> 01:31:47,50
SOMEONE watches as he exits the vault with the capsule and shakes his head. 

IN_TIME_DVS871
01:31:47,00 --> 01:31:51,50
He hands the capsule to her. 

IN_TIME_DVS872
01:32:48,00 --> 01:32:53,50
SOMEONE strides forward, 

IN_TIME_DVS873
01:32:50,00 --> 01:32:54,50
his gun aimed at SOMEONE's head. 

IN_TIME_DVS874
01:32:52,00 --> 01:32:57,50
The businessman backs up a few steps, 

IN_TIME_DVS875
01:32:54,00 --> 01:33:00,50
leaning away from the weapon only inches from his brow. 

IN_TIME_DVS876
01:32:57,00 --> 01:33:02,50
SOMEONE glares at him, then lowers his gun. 

IN_TIME_DVS877
01:33:00,00 --> 01:33:06,50
SOMEONE takes a shaky breath as she watches from a doorway. 

IN_TIME_DVS878
01:33:10,00 --> 01:33:17,50
He strides out of the office and SOMEONE punches a code into the keypad. 

IN_TIME_DVS879
01:33:14,00 --> 01:33:20,50
As the doors slide shut, closing SOMEONE inside, 

IN_TIME_DVS880
01:33:17,00 --> 01:33:22,50
she stares at him through their diminishing gap. 

IN_TIME_DVS881
01:33:20,00 --> 01:33:24,50
SOMEONE aims his gun at the keypad. 

IN_TIME_DVS882
01:33:23,00 --> 01:33:28,50
At the timekeeper's headquarters. 

IN_TIME_DVS883
01:33:29,00 --> 01:33:35,50
SOMEONE eyes the circulation map and per capita table. 

IN_TIME_DVS884
01:33:38,00 --> 01:33:42,50
SOMEONE's brow furrows. 

IN_TIME_DVS885
01:33:42,00 --> 01:33:46,50
SOMEONE sprints out of the building. 

IN_TIME_DVS886
01:33:43,00 --> 01:33:48,50
In a parking garage, SOMEONE pays an attendant. 

IN_TIME_DVS887
01:33:48,00 --> 01:33:55,50
A security gate at the parking booth lifts and SOMEONE drives a limo out of the garage. 

IN_TIME_DVS888
01:33:56,00 --> 01:34:03,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE distractedly chews gum as he steers a cruiser through New Greenwich. 

IN_TIME_DVS889
01:34:00,00 --> 01:34:06,50
His alert eyes scan his surroundings. 

IN_TIME_DVS890
01:34:15,00 --> 01:34:21,50
Riding beside SOMEONE, SOMEONE eyes the capsule. 

IN_TIME_DVS891
01:34:26,00 --> 01:34:31,50
SOMEONE finds 44 minutes on his clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS892
01:34:34,00 --> 01:34:43,50
Spinning the wheel, he skids around a grassy island dividing the two directions of traffic and speeds after the limo. 

IN_TIME_DVS893
01:34:48,00 --> 01:34:55,50
At one end of a bridge, timekeeper vehicles line up along the zone's border. 

IN_TIME_DVS894
01:34:52,00 --> 01:34:59,50
Taking shelter behind them, timekeepers aim their weapons over the hoods. 

IN_TIME_DVS895
01:34:56,00 --> 01:35:02,50
SOMEONE stares with determined eyes as he speeds toward the barricade. 

IN_TIME_DVS896
01:35:00,00 --> 01:35:07,50
SOMEONE glances over her shoulder at SOMEONE's cruiser, which closes in. 

IN_TIME_DVS897
01:35:10,00 --> 01:35:17,50
A barrage of bullets hits the limo, sending sparks off the vehicle's armored body. 

IN_TIME_DVS898
01:35:14,00 --> 01:35:22,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE flinch as shots hit the windshield, leaving dents in the bulletproof glass. 

IN_TIME_DVS899
01:35:19,00 --> 01:35:24,50
SOMEONE briefly takes SOMEONE's hand. 

IN_TIME_DVS900
01:35:21,00 --> 01:35:29,50
He weaves the limo between the cruisers and crashes straight through the border's security booth. 

IN_TIME_DVS901
01:35:26,00 --> 01:35:32,50
The concrete barricades lower and SOMEONE drives over. 

IN_TIME_DVS903
01:35:36,00 --> 01:35:41,50
The limo speeds down a street in the ghetto. 

IN_TIME_DVS904
01:35:38,00 --> 01:35:44,50
Following close behind, SOMEONE's cruiser turns a corner. 

IN_TIME_DVS905
01:35:41,00 --> 01:35:50,50
Meanwhile, outside the Mission, SOMEONE waits with the young proprietor. She blinks her anxious eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS906
01:35:54,00 --> 01:36:03,50
As they speed through an intersection one block from the Mission, SOMEONE's cruiser emerges from the cross street and smashes into them. 

IN_TIME_DVS907
01:36:00,00 --> 01:36:06,50
Both vehicles skid to a stop, billowing smoke. 

IN_TIME_DVS908
01:36:05,00 --> 01:36:10,50
SOMEONE runs over as SOMEONE climbs out of the limo. 

IN_TIME_DVS909
01:36:09,00 --> 01:36:14,50
He glances at the cruiser but sees no movement. 

IN_TIME_DVS910
01:36:13,00 --> 01:36:18,50
He hands her the capsule and her jaw drops. 

IN_TIME_DVS911
01:36:17,00 --> 01:36:21,50
She races off. 

IN_TIME_DVS912
01:36:19,00 --> 01:36:23,50
He's got an hour. 

IN_TIME_DVS913
01:36:22,00 --> 01:36:29,50
SOMEONE gets out of his car. As he aims his gun at SOMEONE and SOMEONE, Dayton residents crowd closer. 

IN_TIME_DVS914
01:36:30,00 --> 01:36:36,50
On the Mission's sign, the words Out Of turn off. 

IN_TIME_DVS915
01:36:37,00 --> 01:36:45,50
Grabbing SOMEONE's hand, SOMEONE pulls her against the flow of the crowd which now hurries toward the Mission. 

IN_TIME_DVS916
01:36:42,00 --> 01:36:55,50
He glances over his shoulder. Behind him, SOMEONE shoves his way past the flood of Dayton residents. With his gun in one hand, he pumps his arms as he sprints furiously. 

IN_TIME_DVS917
01:36:54,00 --> 01:37:01,50
He finds a timekeeper parked on a corner with his driver's side door open. 

IN_TIME_DVS918
01:37:01,00 --> 01:37:08,50
Grabbing him, he hurls him to the ground, climbs into the cruiser, and speeds off. 

IN_TIME_DVS919
01:37:06,00 --> 01:37:14,50
Outside the Mission, the crowd converges around the proprietor, who dispenses time from the stolen cartridge. 

IN_TIME_DVS920
01:37:11,00 --> 01:37:18,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE and SOMEONE flee down a street, still holding hands. 

IN_TIME_DVS921
01:37:19,00 --> 01:37:23,50
He checks his clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS922
01:37:23,00 --> 01:37:31,50
From the cruiser, SOMEONE spots the couple running down a road amid rolling grassy hills. 

IN_TIME_DVS923
01:37:28,00 --> 01:37:33,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE, noting her pained expression. 

IN_TIME_DVS924
01:37:33,00 --> 01:37:39,50
She nods. Meanwhile, the cruiser speeds down a nearby road. 

IN_TIME_DVS925
01:37:37,00 --> 01:37:43,50
A wide view shows SOMEONE and SOMEONE running on cracked pavement. 

IN_TIME_DVS926
01:37:40,00 --> 01:37:45,50
SOMEONE glances over his shoulder. 

IN_TIME_DVS927
01:37:42,00 --> 01:37:47,50
At the top of a hill, SOMEONE parks behind a 

IN_TIME_DVS928
01:37:45,00 --> 01:37:51,50
barricade of concrete blocks across the road which SOMEONE the time zone border. 

IN_TIME_DVS929
01:37:49,00 --> 01:37:56,50
Clutching his gun, he sprints between the blocks and follows the road down the hill. 

IN_TIME_DVS930
01:37:54,00 --> 01:38:01,50
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE close in on the border, SOMEONE cuts them off, his gun raised. 

IN_TIME_DVS931
01:38:01,00 --> 01:38:06,50
They halt in front of him and he gives a relieved look. 

IN_TIME_DVS932
01:38:09,00 --> 01:38:14,50
He allows an impressed smile. 

IN_TIME_DVS933
01:38:13,00 --> 01:38:17,50
SOMEONE scrutinizes him. 

IN_TIME_DVS934
01:38:17,00 --> 01:38:22,50
SOMEONE wipes his brow, then nods. 

IN_TIME_DVS935
01:38:44,00 --> 01:38:51,50
Shaking his head, SOMEONE gives an outraged smile. He glances at SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS936
01:38:51,00 --> 01:38:57,50
SOMEONE's clock shows 1 minute, 26 seconds. 

IN_TIME_DVS937
01:38:56,00 --> 01:39:00,50
SOMEONE nods. 

IN_TIME_DVS938
01:38:57,00 --> 01:39:04,50
A look of realization crosses his face and he shifts his worried eyes. 

IN_TIME_DVS939
01:39:03,00 --> 01:39:11,50
Lowering his gun, he checks his own clock, which counts down from five seconds. 

IN_TIME_DVS940
01:39:09,00 --> 01:39:14,50
His lips part in a shocked expression. 

IN_TIME_DVS941
01:39:13,00 --> 01:39:19,50
He convulses, then falls back with his arms and legs sprawled. 

IN_TIME_DVS942
01:39:16,00 --> 01:39:22,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE exchange a fearful glance. 

IN_TIME_DVS943
01:39:19,00 --> 01:39:25,50
Facing a city on the horizon, SOMEONE checks his clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS944
01:39:22,00 --> 01:39:26,50
58 seconds remain. 

IN_TIME_DVS945
01:39:26,00 --> 01:39:31,50
SOMEONE watches her own clock dip under one minute. 

IN_TIME_DVS946
01:39:38,00 --> 01:39:42,50
His clock shows 45 seconds. 

IN_TIME_DVS947
01:39:41,00 --> 01:39:47,50
He caresses her cheek, then leans in and kisses her. 

IN_TIME_DVS948
01:39:46,00 --> 01:39:53,50
Pulling away, he lifts his thoughtful gaze to the cruiser atop the hill. 

IN_TIME_DVS949
01:39:56,00 --> 01:40:04,50
They take off toward the cruiser. The distance between SOMEONE and SOMEONE grows and SOMEONE checks his clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS950
01:40:01,00 --> 01:40:07,50
20 seconds. He glances over his shoulder. 

IN_TIME_DVS951
01:40:07,00 --> 01:40:13,50
He frantically sprints ahead, his eyes focused on the top of the hill. 

IN_TIME_DVS952
01:40:13,00 --> 01:40:18,50
Behind him, SOMEONE checks her clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS953
01:40:16,00 --> 01:40:22,50
SOMEONE reaches the cruiser and jumps inside. He sets his arm in the scanner. 

IN_TIME_DVS954
01:40:23,00 --> 01:40:32,50
He reads the balance, then races back down the hill. Lifting her arm, SOMEONE finds six seconds left on her clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS955
01:40:30,00 --> 01:40:38,50
SOMEONE reaches out as they draw closer. SOMEONE launches into his arms. 

IN_TIME_DVS956
01:40:35,00 --> 01:40:42,50
As she clings to him, SOMEONE drops to one knee, his arms wrapped around her limp body. 

IN_TIME_DVS957
01:40:40,00 --> 01:40:45,50
With a relieved look, he presses a hand to the back of her head, 

IN_TIME_DVS958
01:40:43,00 --> 01:40:47,50
then pulls away and grins. 

IN_TIME_DVS959
01:40:48,00 --> 01:40:52,50
He checks his clock. 

IN_TIME_DVS960
01:40:54,00 --> 01:40:59,50
With his arms still around her, he helps her to her feet. 

IN_TIME_DVS961
01:40:57,00 --> 01:41:01,50
Cupping her face, he kisses her. 

IN_TIME_DVS962
01:41:01,00 --> 01:41:09,50
Now, in SOMEONE's office, SOMEONE watches the time zone map, which lights up in a frenzy. 

IN_TIME_DVS963
01:41:11,00 --> 01:41:15,50
SOMEONE gazes into his empty vault. 

IN_TIME_DVS964
01:41:14,00 --> 01:41:18,50
A news report plays. 

IN_TIME_DVS966
01:41:42,00 --> 01:41:49,50
SOMEONE and three others watch the circulation map at their headquarters. 

IN_TIME_DVS967
01:41:48,00 --> 01:41:53,50
A female timekeeper turns to him. 

IN_TIME_DVS968
01:41:51,00 --> 01:41:55,50
He gives a resolute nod. 

IN_TIME_DVS969
01:41:54,00 --> 01:42:02,50
Setting his gun on a table, he heads away past a poster kiosk which displays photos of SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

IN_TIME_DVS970
01:42:00,00 --> 01:42:05,50
Now, a news report shows the same images. 

IN_TIME_DVS971
01:42:12,00 --> 01:42:23,50
A captions under the photos reads 100 Years Reward. A wider view shows the news report on a television in a car's console. SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit in front. They share a look and SOMEONE inserts a magazine clip into a gun. 

IN_TIME_DVS974
01:42:23,00 --> 01:42:29,50
They get out of the car. 

IN_TIME_DVS976
01:42:27,00 --> 01:42:34,50
SOMEONE gazes up the wide steps leading to a stately building. 

IN_TIME_DVS977
01:42:33,00 --> 01:42:37,50
He shakes his head. 

IN_TIME_DVS978
01:42:37,00 --> 01:42:42,50
SOMEONE gives a sly smile. 

IN_TIME_DVS979
01:42:39,00 --> 01:42:45,50
She and SOMEONE ready their guns, then jog up the steps. 

IN_TIME_DVS980
01:42:44,00 --> 01:42:53,50
Our view widens to reveal a broad row of pillared stone archways opening into the towering bank's courtyard.
