LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS9
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:38,50
SOMEONE storms off. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS10
00:03:55,00 --> 00:04:01,50
Three years later, at a presentation 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS11
00:04:23,00 --> 00:04:27,50
He cups his ear. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS12
00:04:48,00 --> 00:04:53,50
SOMEONE stands before a class of 12 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS13
00:06:14,00 --> 00:06:19,50
She sets a rock on his lab table. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS14
00:06:31,00 --> 00:06:36,50
She holds a crystal on her necklace. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS15
00:06:38,00 --> 00:06:45,50
She walks off and SOMEONE fixes his gaze on the fossil. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS16
00:06:45,00 --> 00:06:53,50
He puts down a stack of papers, and picks up the prehistoric rock, which shows a familiar indentation. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS17
00:06:54,00 --> 00:07:03,50
The scientist takes a flip-top lighter from his pocket and eyes the inscription: Big Cat. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS18
00:07:01,00 --> 00:07:08,50
He flips open the top and places it in the indentation, a perfect fit. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS19
00:07:06,00 --> 00:07:11,50
SOMEONE breathes in deeply. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS20
00:07:13,00 --> 00:07:17,50
Now outside the La Brea tar pits. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS21
00:07:23,00 --> 00:07:29,50
Inside, SOMEONE lies on the floor. SOMEONE enters his office. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS24
00:08:07,00 --> 00:08:13,50
finds a makeshift electronic device on his desk. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS25
00:08:20,00 --> 00:08:25,50
He grabs a French fry. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS26
00:09:48,00 --> 00:09:52,50
near a fun house with a devil's open mouth. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS27
00:10:07,00 --> 00:10:11,50
by the store. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS28
00:10:15,00 --> 00:10:20,50
SOMEONE eyed the scruffy clerk. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS29
00:10:40,00 --> 00:10:47,50
He removes the tarp, revealing a model of a golden building with two pointed towers. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS30
00:11:12,00 --> 00:11:17,50
A man with a rifle enters. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS31
00:11:18,00 --> 00:11:23,50
The slack-jawed man points at the clerk. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS32
00:11:28,00 --> 00:11:34,50
At the cave entrance, SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit on a raft with the store clerk. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS33
00:11:56,00 --> 00:12:00,50
SOMEONE glares. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS34
00:12:07,00 --> 00:12:12,50
store clerk tosses trash out of the way. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS35
00:12:09,00 --> 00:12:18,50
the beat-up raft down a narrow canal. As they enter the dim cave, he turns on a string of Christmas lights overhead. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS36
00:12:59,00 --> 00:13:03,50
SOMEONE rolls his eyes. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS37
00:13:03,00 --> 00:13:09,50
The clerk furrows his brow and glances around. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS38
00:13:33,00 --> 00:13:38,50
He studies a hand-held meter. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS39
00:13:41,00 --> 00:13:45,50
He turns on the amplifier. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS41
00:13:58,00 --> 00:14:02,50
Rocks fall from the ceiling. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS42
00:14:58,00 --> 00:15:14,50
Into a swirl of white water, they topple out of the raft and disappear into a bright blue light. Back in the cave, the Christmas lights sway over the peaceful canal. A fake alien arm floats on the glassy water at the mouth of the cave. Fade to black. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS43
00:15:17,00 --> 00:15:32,50
Bright light fills our view, then fades to pale desert sand. SOMEONE lies with his headphones askew and his lips parted. An orange life jacket from the raft still sits on his shoulders. He opens his eyes and blinks. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS44
00:15:35,00 --> 00:15:39,50
SOMEONE lifts his head. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS45
00:15:43,00 --> 00:15:59,50
SOMEONE peers through a small window in a homey red door. Slowly opening it, she looks around and gapes. Splintered wood of a destroyed freestanding wall surrounds the door. Two large wooden oars rest at an angle on the sand. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS46
00:15:59,00 --> 00:16:05,50
SOMEONE looks at three daytime moons in the sky. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS47
00:16:04,00 --> 00:16:12,50
SOMEONE stands by a massive Viking ship with a crashed plane in its hull. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS48
00:16:17,00 --> 00:16:22,50
SOMEONE throws down his life jacket. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS49
00:17:12,00 --> 00:17:22,50
As SOMEONE sprints away, the video camera blips off. At a dune, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE plop on their stomachs and peer down at three creatures. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS50
00:17:31,00 --> 00:17:36,50
SOMEONE fidgets. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS51
00:17:49,00 --> 00:17:56,50
looks to SOMEONE at the top of the dune. SOMEONE and SOMEONE arrive beside her. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS52
00:18:02,00 --> 00:18:06,50
SOMEONE holds out a lighter. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS54
00:18:25,00 --> 00:18:41,50
A furry face peeks out from behind a stone block. SOMEONE tilts her head curiously. The time travelers draw closer to the block etched with arrow-shaped hieroglyphics. As it spots them, the primate hides itself behind the block. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS55
00:18:44,00 --> 00:18:49,50
SOMEONE huddles against the stone as SOMEONE bends down. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS56
00:18:51,00 --> 00:18:56,50
SOMEONE stares suspiciously. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS57
00:18:58,00 --> 00:19:04,50
SOMEONE holds out her hand. The primate creeps closer. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS58
00:19:08,00 --> 00:19:13,50
She touches her chest. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS59
00:19:14,00 --> 00:19:20,50
The primate imitates her by resting a hand on SOMEONE's breast. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS60
00:19:26,00 --> 00:19:30,50
She moves the primate's hand and touches his knee. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS61
00:19:39,00 --> 00:19:43,50
SOMEONE cups SOMEONE's breast. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS62
00:19:44,00 --> 00:19:49,50
SOMEONE's hand away. SOMEONE pats her shoulder. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS63
00:20:10,00 --> 00:20:14,50
SOMEONE reaches for SOMEONE. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS64
00:20:47,00 --> 00:20:52,50
SOMEONE clings to SOMEONE's leg, his hand on her breast 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS65
00:20:57,00 --> 00:21:01,50
then pounds her chest. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS66
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:06,50
SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE, then rushes over. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS67
00:21:31,00 --> 00:21:35,50
SOMEONE humps SOMEONE's leg. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS68
00:21:55,00 --> 00:22:02,50
SOMEONE's waist. The four dangle, side by side, high above the ground. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS69
00:22:12,00 --> 00:22:17,50
They glance worriedly over their shoulders. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS70
00:22:19,00 --> 00:22:25,50
SOMEONE gapes at the bones below. A shiny space suit lies amid the rubble. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS71
00:22:34,00 --> 00:22:39,50
They swing back and forth, picking up momentum. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS72
00:22:50,00 --> 00:22:54,50
SOMEONE's fingers almost touch the 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS73
00:25:42,00 --> 00:25:47,50
lips tremble. It angrily withdraws its head from the hole. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS74
00:25:50,00 --> 00:25:57,50
T-rex stomps off, its tail swishing behind it. SOMEONE and SOMEONE peer after it. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS75
00:26:05,00 --> 00:26:09,50
SOMEONE comes up behind them. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS76
00:26:11,00 --> 00:26:15,50
He lifts his trembling chin. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS77
00:26:15,00 --> 00:26:21,50
SOMEONE turns into the cave, and takes in its ridged high-rising walls. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS78
00:26:24,00 --> 00:26:28,50
He drops to one knee. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS79
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:54,50
The group cautiously follows the music, moving deeper into the cave. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS80
00:27:13,00 --> 00:27:21,50
Three crescent moons hover in the dark sky above a warm glow from the setting sun. Inside the cave, 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS81
00:27:20,00 --> 00:27:28,50
continues to turn on the phonograph. SOMEONE rips her pant legs into shorts. SOMEONE touches SOMEONE's bare legs. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS82
00:27:29,00 --> 00:27:35,50
SOMEONE slaps his hand away. He touches her 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS83
00:27:36,00 --> 00:27:43,50
SOMEONE takes a piece of SOMEONE's pants over to a blanket, where he sits and flails around. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS84
00:28:10,00 --> 00:28:14,50
SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS85
00:28:13,00 --> 00:28:17,50
She squats in front of him. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS87
00:28:57,00 --> 00:29:02,50
SOMEONE smiles and walks away. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS88
00:29:00,00 --> 00:29:05,50
SOMEONE glares as SOMEONE squats down. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS89
00:29:08,00 --> 00:29:13,50
spots SOMEONE carrying a crate. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS91
00:29:48,00 --> 00:30:03,50
Now, SOMEONE creeps to the mouth of the cave, clutching a set of bicycle handlebars. Beside him, SOMEONE wears a helmet and carries a shield, while SOMEONE wields a gardening hoe. SOMEONE's gaze falls on a large round object wrapped in leaves. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS92
00:30:04,00 --> 00:30:13,50
With wide eyes, he crouches down in front of the mysterious package. He grits his teeth as he peels back a waxy leaf. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS93
00:30:15,00 --> 00:30:21,50
SOMEONE lifts an object the size of a large beach ball. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS94
00:30:20,00 --> 00:30:25,50
From across the lush valley, 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS95
00:31:23,00 --> 00:31:28,50
SOMEONE turns off the camera as SOMEONE and SOMEONE enter. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS96
00:31:49,00 --> 00:31:53,50
SOMEONE breaks open a melon-like fruit. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS97
00:32:02,00 --> 00:32:06,50
The spiders crawl out of the fruit and up SOMEONE. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS98
00:32:13,00 --> 00:32:17,50
He eats it, then smiles. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS99
00:32:40,00 --> 00:32:49,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE race outside and she hands him binoculars. Through the lenses, he sees a flash of light receding into the jungle. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS101
00:33:21,00 --> 00:33:26,50
They chase SOMEONE. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS102
00:33:26,00 --> 00:33:32,50
In the jungle, SOMEONE jogs to a stop. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS103
00:33:32,00 --> 00:33:37,50
He faces a crystal pylon. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS104
00:33:39,00 --> 00:33:45,50
He ducks a thrown rock, which smashes into a statue. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS105
00:34:04,00 --> 00:34:10,50
SOMEONE points fearfully at a statue. The others enter the plaza ruins. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS106
00:34:09,00 --> 00:34:16,50
Clawed reptilian feet step out from a row of niches along a rock wall. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS107
00:34:25,00 --> 00:34:29,50
They see hundreds of eagle-sized bats. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS108
00:34:41,00 --> 00:34:45,50
They face the pylon. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS109
00:34:50,00 --> 00:34:56,50
He places both palms on the transparent structure. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS110
00:35:02,00 --> 00:35:06,50
He puts his hands on it. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS111
00:35:54,00 --> 00:35:59,50
Nearby graffiti reads, "Beware of Sleestak." 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS112
00:35:59,00 --> 00:36:07,50
SOMEONE grips SOMEONE's chin and turns his head to look at dozens of lizard-like creatures emerging from niches in the plaza wall. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS113
00:36:10,00 --> 00:36:14,50
Survivors back away from them. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS114
00:36:51,00 --> 00:37:01,50
SOMEONE manipulates her hand until the buckle reflects a beam of sunlight. He aims the ray at the eye of a statue and it bounces among the reflect 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS115
00:37:13,00 --> 00:37:17,50
They linger outside. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS116
00:37:28,00 --> 00:37:32,50
They're standing in a vast limbo. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS117
00:37:36,00 --> 00:37:41,50
from SOMEONE's vision, lies prone. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS118
00:38:27,00 --> 00:38:31,50
He stands at a table of crystals. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS120
00:41:02,00 --> 00:41:07,50
He uses a laser pointer. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS121
00:41:15,00 --> 00:41:20,50
He fills a mini hot air balloon made out of a blowfish. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS122
00:42:39,00 --> 00:42:45,50
SOMEONE folds his arms with a smirk. SOMEONE looks to SOMEONE. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS123
00:43:06,00 --> 00:43:10,50
He raises the jug. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS124
00:43:29,00 --> 00:43:34,50
SOMEONE winces queasily and SOMEONE clutches a hand to her mouth. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS125
00:43:39,00 --> 00:43:44,50
He holds out the jug. SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS126
00:43:46,00 --> 00:43:51,50
He wipes his eyes and blinks. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS127
00:44:18,00 --> 00:44:22,50
He rubs his eyes. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS128
00:44:23,00 --> 00:44:28,50
SOMEONE sits on a rock, pointing. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS129
00:44:38,00 --> 00:44:45,50
Now, SOMEONE leads the humans out of the jungle and into a vast desert. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS130
00:44:53,00 --> 00:45:01,50
SOMEONE points. Our view pulls back through the broken window of a British phone booth. Beyond it, the Golden Gate bridge juts from 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS131
00:45:07,00 --> 00:45:12,50
A Union 76 Ball revolve 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS132
00:45:40,00 --> 00:45:44,50
vendor peers through the window. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS133
00:45:58,00 --> 00:46:03,50
rush past SOMEONE and the scientist heading 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS134
00:46:44,00 --> 00:46:49,50
Two Allosaurus sniff the air, then face the humans. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS135
00:48:06,00 --> 00:48:16,50
The Allosaurus moves on. Grumpy plunges his head in. From a distance, SOMEONE video-records the T-Rex emerging from 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS136
00:48:27,00 --> 00:48:32,50
SOMEONE races through a row of tollbooths. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS137
00:48:51,00 --> 00:48:55,50
They Bounce on the limo's roof. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS138
00:49:24,00 --> 00:49:28,50
He scampers off, kicking a can. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS139
00:49:28,00 --> 00:49:34,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hide near a medieval catapult. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS140
00:50:40,00 --> 00:50:44,50
He falls over, frozen stiff. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS141
00:50:57,00 --> 00:51:02,50
SOMEONE grins hopefully. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS142
00:51:13,00 --> 00:51:23,50
Pterodactyl swoops down and grabs it, taking the amplifier with it. SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE stare helplessly as the predator flies away with the device. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS143
00:51:28,00 --> 00:51:44,50
Hanging his head, the scientist sulks off. SOMEONE gazes after him worriedly. Later, she, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE trek through the dumping ground. They find SOMEONE reclining listlessly in the back of an old half-buried Cadillac convertible. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS144
00:52:38,00 --> 00:52:43,50
He robotically sticks his hand halfway down his pants. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS145
00:53:18,00 --> 00:53:26,50
away, SOMEONE storms off through the dumping ground. SOMEONE steps closer to SOMEONE and shrugs his brow. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS146
00:53:27,00 --> 00:53:32,50
The scientist scratches his head. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS147
00:53:37,00 --> 00:53:47,50
They leave SOMEONE alone. Nighttime. In the jungle, SOMEONE writes in her journal by a campfire. Bugs the size of 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS148
00:53:44,00 --> 00:53:53,50
hummingbirds flutter around her and she waves them away. SOMEONE crosses to SOMEONE, who sits forlornly on his own. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS149
00:55:14,00 --> 00:55:23,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE turn and SOMEONE looks up from her journal. In tree-dappled moonlight, SOMEONE strolls into view, strumming a 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS151
00:55:24,00 --> 00:55:31,50
scientist plants his feet, facing his companions with a sober expression. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS154
00:57:19,00 --> 00:57:27,50
the bug and splattering blood everywhere. He looks up, his face ashen and his chest heaving. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS155
00:57:34,00 --> 00:57:40,50
SOMEONE blinks groggily, then leans his head back. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS156
00:57:40,00 --> 00:57:52,50
Daytime. Sunbeams filter through the trees. SOMEONE sleeps curled up by SOMEONE, his hand on her breast. SOMEONE sleeps nearby. A few feet away, SOMEONE stands up 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS157
00:57:51,00 --> 00:57:58,50
He twists from the waist, exposing a basketball-sized welt on his shoulder blade. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS158
00:58:17,00 --> 00:58:22,50
He puts his shirt on. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS159
00:59:01,00 --> 00:59:10,50
As they climb, SOMEONE lags far behind. Now they near the top. The pterodactyl swoops overhead. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS160
00:59:15,00 --> 00:59:23,50
SOMEONE looks to SOMEONE, who grins and gives an encouraging nod. He points up and they climb to the top. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS161
00:59:59,00 --> 01:00:03,50
He turns to find his primitive friend feigning 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS162
01:00:11,00 --> 01:00:15,50
He drops his backpack. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS163
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:19,50
SOMEONE touches his shoulder and he pauses. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS164
01:00:17,00 --> 01:00:22,50
They share a tender look. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS165
01:00:35,00 --> 01:00:41,50
He removes his khaki shirt, leaving his T-shirt on. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS166
01:01:14,00 --> 01:01:25,50
The eggs tremble atop their perches. SOMEONE fearfully turns and one of the eggshells cracks. Several more begin to hatch as he watches helplessly. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS167
01:01:23,00 --> 01:01:28,50
On the other side, SOMEONE edges back and SOMEONE swallows hard. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS168
01:01:27,00 --> 01:01:32,50
beak hooks through one of the eggshells as a baby pterodactyl 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS169
01:01:30,00 --> 01:01:36,50
Several more follow suit. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS170
01:02:23,00 --> 01:02:30,50
He smiles modestly. SOMEONE turns, finding all the hatchlings asleep behind him. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS171
01:02:32,00 --> 01:02:39,50
Now, SOMEONE flies through the air, waving his arms. SOMEONE follows, belly down. SOMEONE 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS172
01:03:12,00 --> 01:03:16,50
and hands one to SOMEONE and another to SOMEONE. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS173
01:03:18,00 --> 01:03:23,50
Both men drink the fruit's nectar. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS174
01:04:26,00 --> 01:04:31,50
SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE a look of concern. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS175
01:04:32,00 --> 01:04:38,50
Later in the pool, SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE with bloodshot eyes. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS176
01:04:54,00 --> 01:04:58,50
As SOMEONE's stoned gaze remain 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS177
01:04:56,00 --> 01:05:02,50
SOMEONE, he shifts his jaw. SOMEONE pops up again. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS178
01:05:04,00 --> 01:05:12,50
By the table, SOMEONE stands with the Tachyon Amplifier strapped over her chest. She turns it on. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS179
01:05:10,00 --> 01:05:15,50
She takes a few steps away from the pool. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS180
01:05:16,00 --> 01:05:20,50
across the desert, she grins. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS181
01:05:20,00 --> 01:05:27,50
over the pristine white sand, SOMEONE carries the device about 100 yards from the pool. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS182
01:05:27,00 --> 01:05:39,50
She stops, frowning. Before her, a triangle rises from the ground. From a distance, the crystalline pylon almost disappears against the cloudy sky. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS183
01:05:42,00 --> 01:05:52,50
SOMEONE approaches it, her hand still on the Tachyon Amplifier. Now, clumps of vines hang from the rough-hewn walls of the cavern. Entering, 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS184
01:05:51,00 --> 01:06:01,50
two massive crystals jutting out at opposite angles, and each emitting a bluish glow. Meanwhile, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE lie on their backs on a dune. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS185
01:06:08,00 --> 01:06:20,50
On the distant horizon, a huge creature crawls toward them. SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE all turn their heads in unison. It's a giant crab, snapping two huge claws. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS186
01:06:19,00 --> 01:06:26,50
The guys lift their heads, fixated on the creature. The crab draws closer. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS187
01:06:38,00 --> 01:06:45,50
Now as the sun sets, the three feast on the giant crab. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS188
01:06:43,00 --> 01:06:51,50
SOMEONE squeezes a humongous lemon wedge over SOMEONE's piece, then adds some juice to his own. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS189
01:07:36,00 --> 01:07:39,50
SOMEONE high fives SOMEONE. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS190
01:08:44,00 --> 01:08:48,50
From a distance, we see SOMEONE and SOMEONE 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS191
01:09:00,00 --> 01:09:13,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE steps across the spongy cavern floor. A dozen more crystals jut from the walls. She notices a group of softball-sized eggs on a brown steaming mound. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS192
01:09:17,00 --> 01:09:24,50
She pulls one of the eggs from the mound and clear goo drips from its bottom. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS193
01:09:22,00 --> 01:09:29,50
As she examines the egg, the SOMEONE's hologram pops up behind her. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS194
01:09:56,00 --> 01:10:01,50
The SOMEONE collapses. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS197
01:10:07,00 --> 01:10:13,50
SOMEONE approaches his slain body. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS198
01:10:22,00 --> 01:10:31,50
Now, the tree of the narcotic fruit lies bare. Poolside, the three pals sleep, wearing matching towels around their waists. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS199
01:10:42,00 --> 01:10:47,50
SOMEONE awakes. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS200
01:11:03,00 --> 01:11:12,50
Inside the cavern, SOMEONE pops up, shifting his eyes side to side. He attempts to move stealthily amid the crystals. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS201
01:11:10,00 --> 01:11:18,50
Looking back, he flashes a complex set of hand signals. At the mouth of the cave, SOMEONE shrugs. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS202
01:11:19,00 --> 01:11:24,50
SOMEONE follows SOMEONE past the crystals. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS203
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:28,50
they hide behind a wall. Beyond an opening into another chamber, two SOMEONE walks. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS204
01:11:41,00 --> 01:11:47,50
As two SOMEONE hold each other, their frog-like throats expand. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS205
01:11:55,00 --> 01:12:00,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE look on. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS206
01:12:04,00 --> 01:12:12,50
Their voyeuristic expressions sour and two Sleestak skins land at their feet. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS207
01:12:15,00 --> 01:12:21,50
SOMEONE covers his mouth. SOMEONE grimaces and they share a look. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS209
01:14:14,00 --> 01:14:19,50
She wraps her arms around his neck and gives him a passionate kiss. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS210
01:14:53,00 --> 01:14:58,50
SOMEONE stops kissing her. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS212
01:15:29,00 --> 01:15:34,50
they fall in line. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS213
01:16:20,00 --> 01:16:28,50
SOMEONE notices the dot of his laser pointer on his chest. It works its way up to his forehead. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS214
01:16:46,00 --> 01:16:51,50
He steps out to face Grumpy. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS215
01:17:03,00 --> 01:17:08,50
He picks up a rock and throws it at her. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS216
01:17:10,00 --> 01:17:16,50
With a hurt gaze, SOMEONE walks down the steps, past Grumpy. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS217
01:17:19,00 --> 01:17:23,50
SOMEONE hands SOMEONE a bag. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS218
01:18:22,00 --> 01:18:26,50
He gives him a man hug. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS219
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:34,50
SOMEONE leaves past Grumpy. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS220
01:18:38,00 --> 01:18:42,50
He hurries across the platform and 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS221
01:19:11,00 --> 01:19:16,50
tosses aside the bag of fireworks. SOMEONE 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS223
01:19:31,00 --> 01:19:36,50
behind a rock, SOMEONE watches the battle. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS224
01:19:36,00 --> 01:19:40,50
digs in the bag. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS225
01:19:40,00 --> 01:19:44,50
a Roman candle, he takes out his lighter. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS226
01:19:57,00 --> 01:20:00,50
SOMEONE looks on. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS227
01:21:17,00 --> 01:21:21,50
SOMEONE rocket him. He ducks. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS228
01:21:45,00 --> 01:21:49,50
out of the plaza.  

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS229
01:21:53,00 --> 01:21:59,50
SOMEONE leans wearily against a rock and faces SOMEONE. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS231
01:24:10,00 --> 01:24:15,50
He guards the humans. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS233
01:24:42,00 --> 01:24:47,50
SOMEONE sniffs at SOMEONE's stained clothes. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS234
01:25:11,00 --> 01:25:16,50
The Tyrannosaur faces SOMEONE. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS235
01:25:29,00 --> 01:25:35,50
SOMEONE holds out his fist. Grumpy steps forward and taps it with 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS242
01:27:01,00 --> 01:27:08,50
SOMEONE stares at the tiny fragments of the broken crystal. He runs to SOMEONE and rips off her necklace.  

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS243
01:27:17,00 --> 01:27:21,50
As they race toward the vortex, 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS244
01:28:19,00 --> 01:28:24,50
SOMEONE purses his lips. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS245
01:28:29,00 --> 01:28:35,50
Holding hands, they jog toward the image of Earth in the vortex. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS246
01:28:39,00 --> 01:28:46,50
SOMEONE smiles and waves. SOMEONE and SOMEONE jump through the vortex, which vanish 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS247
01:28:46,00 --> 01:28:52,50
beside the trailer. Light flashes from the fun house. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS248
01:28:54,00 --> 01:29:00,50
The two scientists face each other, their jaws hanging slack. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS249
01:29:01,00 --> 01:29:08,50
They share a tight embrace. SOMEONE pulls away, cupping SOMEONE's head in her hand. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS250
01:29:07,00 --> 01:29:13,50
Her hazel eyes shine as she beams up at him. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS251
01:29:16,00 --> 01:29:31,50
SOMEONE knits his brow and shakes his head. SOMEONE's smile grows forced and she drops her gaze. Wincing, the scientist leans his head back, then puts a finger beneath her chin, and guides her face upward. He leans in for a kiss. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS252
01:29:31,00 --> 01:29:36,50
They notice SOMEONE outside. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS253
01:30:08,00 --> 01:30:13,50
Back in the Land of the Lost. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS254
01:30:25,00 --> 01:30:30,50
SOMEONE hops on SOMEONE for a piggyback. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS255
01:30:30,00 --> 01:30:39,50
SOMEONE carries the primate to the top of a dune. A vast Pakuni village sprawls in the lush valley below. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS256
01:31:00,00 --> 01:31:05,50
nearly nude Pakuni women race up the dune. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS257
01:31:30,00 --> 01:31:35,50
The women fawn over SOMEONE. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS258
01:31:36,00 --> 01:31:40,50
He notices a woman standing behind 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS259
01:31:43,00 --> 01:31:48,50
Today Show logo rotates. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS260
01:32:30,00 --> 01:32:36,50
SOMEONE hands SOMEONE a thick book. The host eyes it irritably. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS261
01:32:55,00 --> 01:33:02,50
black. A title appears, word by word: Land of the Lost. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS263
01:36:18,00 --> 01:36:26,50
As the overhead lights dim, an assistant picks up the egg. 

LAND_OF_THE_LOST_DVS264
01:36:30,00 --> 01:36:39,50
The TV crew shuts off the lights and heads out of the studio.
