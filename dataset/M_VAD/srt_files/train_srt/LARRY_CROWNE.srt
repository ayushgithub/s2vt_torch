LARRY_CROWNE_DVS10
00:03:10,00 --> 00:03:14,50
He unfastens his brace. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS11
00:03:14,00 --> 00:03:18,50
In apparel with a trainee. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS12
00:04:09,00 --> 00:04:13,50
It shows all team of executives. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS13
00:04:14,00 --> 00:04:19,50
He points to a crown on his mug. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS14
00:04:41,00 --> 00:04:48,50
SOMEONE glances from his white-mustached boss to a trio of younger executives. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS15
00:05:18,00 --> 00:05:24,50
The senior executive meets his gaze. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS16
00:05:31,00 --> 00:05:35,50
Man shows a ring. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS17
00:05:39,00 --> 00:05:44,50
Unfazed executive grins. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS18
00:06:05,00 --> 00:06:10,50
SOMEONE stares. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS19
00:06:35,00 --> 00:06:41,50
The beefy executive callously picks pizza out of his teeth. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS20
00:06:41,00 --> 00:06:47,50
Larry’s eyes glisten in a helpless stare. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS21
00:06:45,00 --> 00:06:52,50
The brown-faced executive spreads his hands. SOMEONE takes a breath 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS22
00:06:49,00 --> 00:06:59,50
to speak then swallows and looks away. Now traffic lines up behind SOMEONE as he drives his SUV with a stunned gaze. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS23
00:06:57,00 --> 00:07:21,50
A view with the left break light shows the SUV gliding into the driveway of a modest home with a well-manicured front lawn. Nighttime. A doorway on the opposite end of the cluttered room frames SOMEONE as he sits on the edge of his bed. Later he lies awake on his stomach, with one-half of his face against a pillow. Now on his back, he presses his hands to his face. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS24
00:07:19,00 --> 00:07:38,50
An open doorway shows a glimpse of SOMEONE shoveling through the house. In an adjacent room a globe lamp glows softly. Standing in a closet of mostly empty hangers, SOMEONE hangs up his red U-Mart polo shirt. He stares at it for a moment, then slides the closet door shut. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS25
00:07:37,00 --> 00:07:41,50
Daytime. A series of phone calls. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS26
00:07:57,00 --> 00:08:16,50
SOMEONE flips his cellphone shut and rests this chin in his hand. Now at a bathroom sink he turns on the cold-water tap and bends over to splash his face. Later, he gazes worriedly into the mirror, as he blots his skin with a towel. Now he holds a pair of slacks on an ironing board. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS27
00:08:55,00 --> 00:09:01,50
Now he sits across from a banker with blond, feathered hair. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS28
00:09:26,00 --> 00:09:31,50
SOMEONE's chest heaves. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS29
00:09:41,00 --> 00:09:49,50
Now at home, SOMEONE hauls lawn chairs and a bag of golf clubs out to his front lawn. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS30
00:10:12,00 --> 00:10:16,50
SOMEONE puffs a pipe. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS31
00:10:58,00 --> 00:11:05,50
SOMEONE follows his neighbor into a garage filled with secondhand goods. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS32
00:11:18,00 --> 00:11:23,50
He hands SOMEONE a booklet. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS33
00:11:42,00 --> 00:11:46,50
Back in the present. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS34
00:12:05,00 --> 00:12:09,50
Entrance reads East Valley Community. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS35
00:12:18,00 --> 00:12:22,50
He looks at map and checks it, then. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS37
00:12:23,00 --> 00:12:27,50
Now at a registration desk he looks over a course book. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS38
00:12:25,00 --> 00:12:32,50
A silver haired man with a bowtie and a toothy smile approaches him. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS39
00:13:14,00 --> 00:13:18,50
He points at the course book. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS40
00:13:27,00 --> 00:13:32,50
He gives a suggestive wink. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS41
00:13:43,00 --> 00:13:53,50
Camera bulb flashes and a student ID appears, featuring a photo of a puzzled-looking SOMEONE. Now at a gas station SOMEONE inspects the ID. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS42
00:13:51,00 --> 00:13:59,50
Gas tank pocketing his wallet, he eyes the pump’s display. As his gas cost ticks up past $60 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS43
00:14:01,00 --> 00:14:05,50
He fills his small tank. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS44
00:14:10,00 --> 00:14:15,50
SOMEONE’s total passes $70.00. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS45
00:14:14,00 --> 00:14:19,50
The scooter’s total is less than four. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS46
00:14:22,00 --> 00:14:26,50
The scooter’s meek. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS47
00:14:26,00 --> 00:14:31,50
He wrenches the gas nozzle from his tank. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS48
00:14:34,00 --> 00:14:38,50
SOMEONE approaches a scooter. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS49
00:14:41,00 --> 00:14:46,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS50
00:15:19,00 --> 00:15:26,50
Now SOMEONE carries over a flat screen TV. Later he straddles the scooter. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS51
00:15:46,00 --> 00:15:51,50
He falters, half astride the scooter. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS52
00:15:53,00 --> 00:15:57,50
Mill around outside East Valley Community College. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS53
00:15:56,00 --> 00:16:01,50
She pulls into a space in the parking lot. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS54
00:16:03,00 --> 00:16:10,50
Driver side door opens and a woman’s hand sets a pair of high heels on the ground. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS55
00:16:08,00 --> 00:16:12,50
Shapely foot slides into each high heels. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS56
00:16:11,00 --> 00:16:17,50
Owner an alluring woman with wavy auburn hair emerges. Wearing 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS57
00:16:22,00 --> 00:16:26,50
she trudges down a hall. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS58
00:16:28,00 --> 00:16:33,50
She enters her in her cluttered office reading the document. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS59
00:16:32,00 --> 00:16:36,50
She sits at her desk, 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS60
00:16:36,00 --> 00:16:40,50
she brushes her hair out of her face. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS61
00:16:45,00 --> 00:16:50,50
Then opens a drawer and takes out a pill. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS63
00:16:55,00 --> 00:17:03,50
She takes a weary breath. A full-figured raven-haired woman holding a to-go cup appears in her doorway. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS64
00:17:17,00 --> 00:17:22,50
Her colleague enters an office across the hall. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS65
00:17:44,00 --> 00:17:49,50
Still sitting, she sips her drink. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS66
00:18:13,00 --> 00:18:17,50
The young woman grins. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS67
00:18:22,00 --> 00:18:27,50
Removing her helmet, she shakes out her curly hair. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS68
00:18:32,00 --> 00:18:37,50
SOMEONE eyes his belted khakis. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS69
00:18:44,00 --> 00:18:51,50
Now the auburn haired professor peeks in through a window in a classroom door. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS70
00:18:50,00 --> 00:18:55,50
She enters and looks around. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS71
00:18:54,00 --> 00:18:59,50
She counts the meager number of students. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS72
00:18:58,00 --> 00:19:02,50
She checks again. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS73
00:19:14,00 --> 00:19:18,50
The students stare at her. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS74
00:19:23,00 --> 00:19:27,50
SOMEONE bursts in through another door. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS75
00:19:26,00 --> 00:19:33,50
The students follow his gaze to their professor, whose shoulders sag disappointedly. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS76
00:19:34,00 --> 00:19:38,50
Strides to the front of the class. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS77
00:19:45,00 --> 00:19:58,50
He watches from a front desk off to one side, as Professor SOMEONE sets down her back. The instructor gazes out at their expectant faces, then gives an indifferent shrug. She writes on a chalkboard in front of them. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS78
00:20:07,00 --> 00:20:13,50
Breaks, she waves dismissively. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS79
00:20:29,00 --> 00:20:35,50
She gives a bright firm nod. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS80
00:20:38,00 --> 00:20:47,50
She eyes the students who shoot each other uneasy glances, then return their attention to their professor. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS81
00:20:57,00 --> 00:21:03,50
A young man with dark curly hair raises his hand. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS82
00:21:02,00 --> 00:21:07,50
With a wry look she cocks her head. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS83
00:21:06,00 --> 00:21:11,50
Her eyes narrow. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS84
00:21:13,00 --> 00:21:18,50
SOMEONE blinks apprehensively. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS85
00:21:30,00 --> 00:21:38,50
He smiles and nods. The other students shift their uneasy gazes to Miss SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS86
00:21:42,00 --> 00:21:49,50
SOMEONE half-smiles in SOMEONE’s direction but breaks off an urge to comment to him. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS87
00:21:48,00 --> 00:21:53,50
He answers his cell. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS88
00:21:53,00 --> 00:21:58,50
Miss SOMEONE's jaw drops. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS89
00:21:58,00 --> 00:22:05,50
With a resolute nod she strides up to SOMEONE's desk and raps on it. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS90
00:22:14,00 --> 00:22:23,50
He hangs up. As the professor leaves SOMEONE's desk, SOMEONE watches her alertly. Later, he hurries. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS91
00:22:30,00 --> 00:22:34,50
Seated at the end of one. He stops. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS92
00:22:43,00 --> 00:22:47,50
He sits beside her. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS93
00:23:15,00 --> 00:23:24,50
SOMEONE gives a puzzled frown, SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE. Tilting her head she considers him. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS94
00:23:25,00 --> 00:23:30,50
SOMEONE's brow crinkles. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS95
00:23:33,00 --> 00:23:37,50
She snags his cell. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS96
00:23:34,00 --> 00:23:39,50
She tosses its casing to. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS98
00:23:50,00 --> 00:23:54,50
He adjusts a mic. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS99
00:24:25,00 --> 00:24:31,50
He smiles. The students stare. His smile widens, 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS100
00:24:29,00 --> 00:24:34,50
he grins more broadly. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS101
00:24:37,00 --> 00:24:42,50
He lifts his brow at the unresponsive students. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS102
00:24:53,00 --> 00:25:01,50
Another classroom Miss SOMEONE writes care on a blackboard then faces two males and two females. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS103
00:25:01,00 --> 00:25:06,50
She gives a disappointed nod. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS104
00:25:06,00 --> 00:25:17,50
With her eyes averted, she grabs her bag off the table and strides to the back of the classroom. The students watch as the professor exits. Now in a computer 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS105
00:25:17,00 --> 00:25:22,50
saw an image of a woman in her underwear. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS109
00:25:46,00 --> 00:25:53,50
She grabs two bottles from a liquor cabinet. Her high heels off, she dumps ice into a blender. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS110
00:25:52,00 --> 00:25:57,50
Scans his office. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS111
00:25:56,00 --> 00:26:01,50
He grabs a book and enters the kitchen. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS112
00:26:25,00 --> 00:26:30,50
His wife indifferently sips her drink. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS113
00:26:28,00 --> 00:26:33,50
She lowers the cocktail. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS114
00:26:41,00 --> 00:26:46,50
She sits in an armchair. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS115
00:26:49,00 --> 00:26:53,50
Guilty frown. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS116
00:27:07,00 --> 00:27:11,50
He rolls his eyes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS117
00:27:10,00 --> 00:27:16,50
As he sits across from SOMEONE, she looks up from her magazine. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS118
00:27:33,00 --> 00:27:38,50
She takes two long swigs. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS119
00:27:36,00 --> 00:27:41,50
Closing her eyes, she leans forward. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS120
00:27:39,00 --> 00:27:45,50
She holds her brow. She winces. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS122
00:28:28,00 --> 00:28:35,50
SOMEONE meets his gaze. She opens her mouth to speak, then strides off. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS123
00:28:37,00 --> 00:28:46,50
Escaping to a balcony, SOMEONE closes the sliding door and sits. Her husband wraps on the glass, his gaze intolerant. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS124
00:28:46,00 --> 00:28:51,50
He cups his hands around his mouth. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS125
00:28:54,00 --> 00:29:02,50
Now in speech class a blond student hyperactively swivels a Lacrosse stick in her two-handed grip. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS126
00:29:31,00 --> 00:29:36,50
SOMEONE shyly raises a hand. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS127
00:29:41,00 --> 00:29:52,50
SOMEONE squares a stack of notecards on his desk then rises from his seat. As he moves behind the lectern the dean smiles excitedly. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS128
00:29:50,00 --> 00:29:55,50
SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS129
00:30:09,00 --> 00:30:14,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS130
00:30:21,00 --> 00:30:26,50
SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE checks his phone 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS131
00:30:25,00 --> 00:30:30,50
and picks lint of his shirt. He blinks nervously. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS132
00:30:30,00 --> 00:30:34,50
He checks his notes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS133
00:30:32,00 --> 00:30:38,50
As the dean gapes, SOMEONE narrows her eyes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS134
00:30:46,00 --> 00:30:51,50
As SOMEONE sits back down the dean grins. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS135
00:30:57,00 --> 00:31:02,50
SOMEONE heads to the podium. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS136
00:31:06,00 --> 00:31:11,50
SOMEONE stares disbelievingly. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS137
00:31:11,00 --> 00:31:14,50
Into the mic. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS138
00:31:22,00 --> 00:31:27,50
Grinning he glances around at his classmates. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS139
00:31:38,00 --> 00:31:44,50
Lying on the floor with his toe and the other two back away. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS140
00:31:51,00 --> 00:31:59,50
He snaps as he steps from side to side repeatedly putting his feet apart then together. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS141
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:06,50
Legs bent, he swivels his knees in and out. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS143
00:32:17,00 --> 00:32:23,50
Hovers on the movie screen, asking, Scoot? 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS144
00:32:25,00 --> 00:32:29,50
takes the phone out again. Another 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS145
00:32:28,00 --> 00:32:32,50
and look to your left. Furrowing his brow 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS146
00:32:31,00 --> 00:32:34,50
He turns over his shoulder and sees SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS147
00:32:33,00 --> 00:32:37,50
riding a scooter. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS148
00:32:41,00 --> 00:32:46,50
Professor SOMEONE glares. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS149
00:32:46,00 --> 00:32:51,50
He stands in front of SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS150
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:57,50
SOMEONE closes his cell and places it in the professor's hand. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS151
00:33:00,00 --> 00:33:04,50
As he walks off, SOMEONE 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS152
00:33:04,00 --> 00:33:08,50
to SOMEONE, who winces. Later. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS153
00:33:13,00 --> 00:33:17,50
SOMEONE reverts his gaze as she 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS154
00:33:22,00 --> 00:33:26,50
his polo. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS155
00:33:29,00 --> 00:33:33,50
SOMEONE locks his menacing. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS156
00:35:48,00 --> 00:35:52,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS157
00:37:03,00 --> 00:37:07,50
Hurries over. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS158
00:37:16,00 --> 00:37:21,50
SOMEONE heads home. A scruffy friend studies a 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS159
00:37:29,00 --> 00:37:33,50
while he searches a rack of clothes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS160
00:37:33,00 --> 00:37:36,50
Her pair of shorts. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS161
00:37:51,00 --> 00:38:02,50
In SOMEONE's house, the middle-aged student highlights almost every line on a textbook's pages. Seated at his kitchen island he looks to the front door and doffs his glasses. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS162
00:38:00,00 --> 00:38:05,50
SOMEONE enters with a blonde friend. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS163
00:38:30,00 --> 00:38:34,50
SOMEONE gets up. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS164
00:38:42,00 --> 00:38:48,50
Later Sal cuts SOMEONE's hair in the bathroom. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS165
00:38:52,00 --> 00:38:56,50
His friends redecorate. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS166
00:39:00,00 --> 00:39:08,50
SOMEONE shrugs. Later SOMEONE drapes a silk scarf over a lamp. In the now smartly arranged living room, 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS167
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:10,50
SOMEONE and a friend read. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS168
00:39:09,00 --> 00:39:15,50

00:39:39,00 --> 00:39:44,50
SOMEONE gives him a kiss. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS172
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:48,50
She follows the others out. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS173
00:39:51,00 --> 00:39:57,50
He peeks through his window blinds, then turns. SOMEONE faces him. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS174
00:40:08,00 --> 00:40:12,50
SOMEONE nods. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS175
00:40:21,00 --> 00:40:25,50
SOMEONE makes eye contact. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS176
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:31,50
Nodding, SOMEONE swallows. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS177
00:40:31,00 --> 00:40:35,50
They stack their left hands on top. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS178
00:40:39,00 --> 00:40:53,50
SOMEONE's look goes from smiley to severe in a split second. He leaves. SOMEONE smoothes his new do, rubbing the sides forward and padding down the back. He views his handsome living room. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS179
00:41:14,00 --> 00:41:19,50
Lamar bites down on his pipe. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS180
00:41:37,00 --> 00:41:41,50
SOMEONE sees SOMEONE watching. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS181
00:42:50,00 --> 00:42:56,50
She raises her window. Later in class. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS182
00:43:09,00 --> 00:43:17,50
SOMEONE doffs his glasses and beams. He sees the female Lacrosse player watching his googly eyed response. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS183
00:43:17,00 --> 00:43:22,50
SOMEONE eyes his professor. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS184
00:43:21,00 --> 00:43:27,50
He winks at her. SOMEONE eyes him flatly, then looks to her right. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS185
00:43:30,00 --> 00:43:34,50
Talk about dance steps sleeps. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS186
00:43:32,00 --> 00:43:37,50
An eraser hits him and he jolts awake. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS187
00:43:42,00 --> 00:43:47,50
She regards SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS188
00:43:48,00 --> 00:43:55,50
His smile wilts and he nervously glances aside. SOMEONE looks to the center. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS189
00:44:07,00 --> 00:44:11,50
SOMEONE points. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS190
00:44:14,00 --> 00:44:19,50
SOMEONE frowns studiously. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS191
00:44:33,00 --> 00:44:38,50
At Talia's photo, teacher's pet. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS192
00:44:37,00 --> 00:44:42,50
I read the course pad. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS193
00:44:44,00 --> 00:44:56,50
The professor's hand reaches out. SOMEONE flips his cellphone shut and hands it over. Standing over him, SOMEONE angrily shakes the phone. Now at a storage facility. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS194
00:45:45,00 --> 00:45:53,50
SOMEONE bends over, his cotton-clad rear inadvertently mooning SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS195
00:45:50,00 --> 00:45:56,50
Takes off his shades and glares at SOMEONE. She shrugs then drapes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS196
00:45:57,00 --> 00:46:02,50
SOMEONE waggles his bottoms into the pants. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS197
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:05,50
Puts his shades back on. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS198
00:46:04,00 --> 00:46:11,50
Now SOMEONE's scooter sits parked outside of SOMEONE's Restaurant. Inside, he pours coffee for group of older men. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS199
00:46:11,00 --> 00:46:17,50
men playing cards. He sets down the pot and sits by SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS200
00:46:29,00 --> 00:46:33,50
SOMEONE eyes him. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS201
00:46:32,00 --> 00:46:36,50
He doffs his glasses. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS202
00:47:00,00 --> 00:47:03,50
Carlos resumes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS203
00:47:05,00 --> 00:47:09,50
Raul nods grimly. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS204
00:47:12,00 --> 00:47:16,50
Now SOMEONE cracks an egg. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS205
00:47:39,00 --> 00:47:44,50
SOMEONE shakes SOMEONE's hand. Now in class. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS206
00:48:06,00 --> 00:48:12,50
The students look over their shoulders. SOMEONE wears vampire fangs. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS207
00:48:28,00 --> 00:48:33,50
SOMEONE hangs his head, SOMEONE wipes her brow. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS208
00:48:33,00 --> 00:48:38,50
His chest. Now our view follow SOMEONE as he weaves through traffic o0n his blue scooter. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS209
00:48:58,00 --> 00:49:02,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS210
00:49:11,00 --> 00:49:18,50
SOMEONE hands over his cell. Later he talks with to the professor outside. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS211
00:49:29,00 --> 00:49:34,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS212
00:49:40,00 --> 00:49:46,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch her go. SOMEONE low 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS213
00:49:50,00 --> 00:49:54,50
parked outside donut prince.  

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS214
00:49:52,00 --> 00:49:58,50
SOMEONE sits in the car with a pen and a slip of paper. Rain trickles down. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS215
00:50:02,00 --> 00:50:07,50
The square of paper aside and grabs another. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS216
00:50:05,00 --> 00:50:10,50
An SUV parks in front of her car. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS217
00:50:13,00 --> 00:50:17,50
SOMEONE drinks from her travel cup. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS218
00:50:15,00 --> 00:50:24,50
Peering ahead, she notices something and sets the cup back down. She gawks as SOMEONE and SOMEONE leave the SUV for the donut shop. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS219
00:50:28,00 --> 00:50:35,50
Windshield wipers swish before her view of the duo closing their umbrellas and entering. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS220
00:50:36,00 --> 00:50:40,50
She feeds SOMEONE a bite. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS221
00:50:45,00 --> 00:50:50,50
They return to SOMEONE's SUV. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS222
00:50:54,00 --> 00:51:01,50
Later, SOMEONE enters the classroom wearing a tasseled scarf. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS223
00:51:05,00 --> 00:51:09,50
SOMEONE enters. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS224
00:51:10,00 --> 00:51:14,50
SOMEONE enters. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS225
00:51:15,00 --> 00:51:20,50
As SOMEONE enters, SOMEONE adjusts the podium. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS226
00:51:22,00 --> 00:51:31,50
She puts down a box then crosses to her desk at the back of the room. SOMEONE draws a paper slip from the box. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS227
00:51:35,00 --> 00:51:42,50
SOMEONE heads for the podium. SOMEONE seated at the desk and checks her watch. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS228
00:51:42,00 --> 00:51:50,50
SOMEONE looks up at a clock, which reads two minutes to eight. He scans his fellow students. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS229
00:51:50,00 --> 00:51:55,50
He fidgets with the paper slip. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS230
00:52:06,00 --> 00:52:10,50
SOMEONE glares. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS232
00:54:27,00 --> 00:54:32,50
She gives him a trendy dark rimmed pair. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS233
00:54:41,00 --> 00:54:47,50
She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him on the cheek. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS234
00:54:48,00 --> 00:54:54,50
SOMEONE takes a seat opposite them. SOMEONE regards him uneasily. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS235
00:54:52,00 --> 00:54:57,50
SOMEONE glares. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS236
00:55:22,00 --> 00:55:30,50
Later, SOMEONE rides glumly as her husband drives. A dessert box sits on the dashboard. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS237
00:56:17,00 --> 00:56:22,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes at him. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS238
00:56:28,00 --> 00:56:34,50
SOMEONE stares ahead, her jaw hanging open. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS239
00:57:14,00 --> 00:57:26,50
She picks up a fistful of pebbles from a tree planter, hurls them after the departing car, then staggers off. Now she sits cross-legged on a bus stop bench in front of a row of dark

00:57:26,00 --> 00:57:30,50
with the flow of traffic the street

00:58:38,00 --> 00:58:41,50
She puts on her high heeled pumps. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS244
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:43,50
She stands. SOMEONE frowns. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS245
00:58:43,00 --> 00:58:47,50
She looks at him with a withering gaze. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS246

01:01:17,00 --> 01:01:24,50
SOMEONE returns the key tin to its pot, then keeps his back to SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS255
01:01:29,00 --> 01:01:35,50
SOMEONE's brow furrows as he listens. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS256
01:01:33,00 --> 01:01:37,50
He rolls his eyes.

01:01:36,00 --> 01:01:41,50
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS258
01:01:42,00 --> 01:01:48,50
Facing her, SOMEONE takes in her drunken grin.

01:01:49,00 --> 01:01:53,50
She shows her ring. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS260
01:02:08,00 --> 01:02:14,50
She smiles through half closed eyes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS261
01:02:21,00 --> 01:02:25,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS262
01:02:38,00 --> 01:02:55,50
SOMEONE gives him a playful grin and SOMEONE stares at her with concerned eyes. She sways slightly, her hands joint beneath her chin and her gaze softens. As she grabs him, SOMEONE wraps his arms around her waist. They kiss. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS263
01:03:00,00 --> 01:03:04,50
Her off her feet and she slaps.

He raps against the trunk, the cab pulls away. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS271
01:05:01,00 --> 01:05:07,50
Cheesecake drips from the takeout box in his hand. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS272
01:05:06,00 --> 01:05:12,50
He lumbers on to the sidewalk and approaches the apartment building. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS273
01:05:12,00 --> 01:05:24,50
On the landing, he finds the contents of his home office. Multiple copies of the same book sit in stacks around his computer, which displays a porn site.

In class SOMEONE wears sunglasses. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS276
01:06:18,00 --> 01:06:23,50
Grabbing a skateboard, SOMEONE smirks at SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS277
01:06:21,00 --> 01:06:34,50
The middle-aged student gathers his things and makes his way towards SOMEONE's table at the back of the room. She sits stiffly, her large dark sunglasses masking most of her expression. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS278
01:06:34,00 --> 01:06:39,50
SOMEONE offers a tender smile. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS279
01:06:51,00 --> 01:06:56,50
SOMEONE's hopeful smile fades. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS280
01:06:58,00 --> 01:07:04,50
SOMEONE's brow knits in a wounded look. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS281
01:07:08,00 --> 01:07:12,50
She gazes off. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS282
01:07:11,00 --> 01:07:17,50
She gives a brisk headshake then returns her attention to SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS283
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:52,50
With his lips pressed in a solemn line SOMEONE gives a respectful nod. SOMEONE's chin twitches as she firmly returns the gesture. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS284
01:07:55,00 --> 01:08:00,50
As he turns away, SOMEONE's shoulders sag. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS285
01:08:00,00 --> 01:08:23,50
Chain swings from SOMEONE's pocket as he pulls his bag over his shoulder. Sitting motionless, the teacher gazes after him, then bows her head as he exits. Now at home, SOMEONE packs papers into a large accordion file. He places a checkmark on the last line of a list. Picking up a key, he eyes a handwritten tag tied to it with string, then throws it in the file. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS286
01:08:22,00 --> 01:08:27,50

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS288
01:09:07,00 --> 01:09:17,50
With a triumphant smirk he turns on his heel and strides out of the bank. Now at the yard sale, he smokes a pipe with Lamar. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS289
01:09:41,00 --> 01:09:46,50
SOMEONE gives him a thoughtful look.

A mother and daughter arrive with a measuring tape. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS291
01:10:07,00 --> 01:10:13,50
While lying in bed, SOMEONE wipes a tear from the corner of her eye. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS292
01:10:18,00 --> 01:10:25,50
Still in her pajamas, she opens a windows blinds. As she peers outside, falling 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS293
01:10:23,00 --> 01:10:28,50
rain reflects against the glass. Lingering by the window 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS294
01:10:27,00 --> 01:10:37,50
from a mug. Now in class she walks among her students with a box of folded slips of paper. Each student draws one. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS295
01:10:47,00 --> 01:10:52,50
SOMEONE draws a topic and reads it.

01:11:19,00 --> 01:11:26,50
SOMEONE strolls up to the podium and sets the cardboard box on top. Her students gather there. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS299
01:11:24,00 --> 01:11:30,50
Picking up a notebook, she heads to the back of the classroom. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS300
01:11:31,00 --> 01:11:36,50
SOMEONE removes his reading glasses, then gazes after her. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS301
01:11:37,00 --> 01:11:44,50
He follows the other students out. Now SOMEONE walks down the hall to her office. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS302
01:12:08,00 --> 01:12:12,50
SOMEONE gapes. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS303
01:12:14,00 --> 01:12:19,50
SOMEONE looks over. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS304
01:12:20,00 --> 01:12:27,50
With her gaze fixed on SOMEONE's SOMEONE twitches a faint, crooked smile. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS305
01:12:25,00 --> 01:12:30,50
SOMEONE enters her office. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS306
01:12:34,00 --> 01:12:39,50
Now in Economics. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS307
01:12:44,00 --> 01:12:48,50
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS308
01:12:51,00 --> 01:12:56,50
SOMEONE stands his class. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS309
01:13:00,00 --> 01:13:07,50
He regards his sober students with wide eyes. SOMEONE taps his pen. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS310
01:13:29,00 --> 01:13:34,50
SOMEONE's smile fades. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS311
01:13:53,00 --> 01:13:57,50
She shows her lower back. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS312
01:13:58,00 --> 01:14:05,50
SOMEONE touches it. Watching them, SOMEONE knocks on the window. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS313
01:14:06,00 --> 01:14:11,50
He throws up his hand and turns away. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS314
01:14:17,00 --> 01:14:22,50
He gets on his scooter. 

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS315
01:14:29,00 --> 01:14:38,50
Now in the kitchen at SOMEONE's, SOMEONE transfers a grilled sandwich on to a plate, garnishes the meal and sets the order on a pickup or a paperback.  

LARRY_CROWNE_DVS316
01:14:37,00 --> 01:14:44,50
