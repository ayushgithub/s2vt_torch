LIFE_OF_PI_DVS41
00:02:44,00 --> 00:02:51,50
Our distant view sharpens to reveal a cheetah patting across a lush habitat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS43
00:02:51,00 --> 00:02:59,50
Two black aardvarks wade through water up to their heads, flapping their long snouts as they move along. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS49
00:03:09,00 --> 00:03:15,50
An array of colorful exotic birds perch around a pond. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS51
00:03:16,00 --> 00:03:25,50
Elsewhere, a proboscis monkey rubs its dangling, bulbous nose. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS52
00:03:23,00 --> 00:03:30,50
Coming out of a cave-like shelter, a rhinoceros turns around. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS53
00:03:27,00 --> 00:03:34,50
Going back in, it halts half way. Its rear-end sticking out in the sunny yard. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS55
00:03:37,00 --> 00:03:42,50
Now a nimble primate swings among the branches of a tree. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS57
00:03:42,00 --> 00:03:50,50
It reaches a high branch and gazes out over its surroundings. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS58
00:03:47,00 --> 00:03:55,50
A small, red-ish bird stands on a floating pad near the concrete rim of a pool. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS59
00:03:52,00 --> 00:03:58,50
The still waters reflect a Bengal tiger stalking past. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS61
00:04:13,00 --> 00:04:18,50
A lizard darts through the rainy yard. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS62
00:04:21,00 --> 00:04:27,50
In a modern kitchen, a middle aged man stands at a stove. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS63
00:04:28,00 --> 00:04:32,50
He eyes a pleasant-faced young man. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS64
00:04:56,00 --> 00:05:01,50
The younger man smiles. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS66
00:05:14,00 --> 00:05:18,50
SOMEONE, she carries a boy. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS67
00:05:25,00 --> 00:05:30,50
He tosses the little boy into the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS68
00:05:28,00 --> 00:05:32,50
In the present. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS69
00:05:52,00 --> 00:06:00,50
In a flashback, a sign labels a complex surrounding a pristine public pool. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS71
00:05:58,00 --> 00:06:04,50
Stylish guests relax on the elegant deck. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS72
00:06:16,00 --> 00:06:24,50
Boasting a broad chest, narrow waist and dark mustache, SOMEONE gazes out with a love-lorn smile. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS73
00:06:21,00 --> 00:06:29,50
As he scans one of the complex's balconies, a swimmer paddles across our view. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS74
00:06:26,00 --> 00:06:32,50
From under water, we watch SOMEONE dive in. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS75
00:06:48,00 --> 00:06:52,50
A flashback at a school. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS76
00:06:56,00 --> 00:07:01,50
A boy peers down into a courtyard. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS79
00:07:24,00 --> 00:07:29,50
The teacher holds a beaker full of yellow fluid. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS80
00:07:29,00 --> 00:07:34,50
Noticing what's in his hands, he puts it down. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS81
00:07:33,00 --> 00:07:39,50
Mortified, SOMEONE glances around the classroom. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS82
00:07:43,00 --> 00:07:50,50
Leaving his seat, the skinny, sad-eyed SOMEONE marches up to the front of the class. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS83
00:07:54,00 --> 00:07:59,50
He writes on a chalkboard. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS84
00:08:17,00 --> 00:08:22,50
The teacher and student stare. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS85
00:08:24,00 --> 00:08:29,50
SOMEONE puts the chalk down and resumes his seat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS86
00:08:44,00 --> 00:08:49,50
SOMEONE leaves another chalkboard and resumes his seat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS87
00:08:54,00 --> 00:08:58,50
On a walkway. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS88
00:08:57,00 --> 00:09:04,50
A librarian rushes with a book among a throng of students to a classroom. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS89
00:09:01,00 --> 00:09:07,50
Inside, SOMEONE fills the chalkboard with numbers. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS90
00:09:04,00 --> 00:09:12,50
Several more boards stand filled to his left and students call out each number he writes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS92
00:09:12,00 --> 00:09:17,50
The librarian consults his book. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS93
00:09:26,00 --> 00:09:30,50
Back in the present. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS94
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:04,50
The writer averts his eyes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS95
00:10:17,00 --> 00:10:21,50
The writer shrugs good naturedly. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS96
00:10:46,00 --> 00:10:52,50
He helps his host bring food to a table and they sit down to lunch. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS97
00:11:02,00 --> 00:11:07,50
He graciously serves his guest. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS98
00:11:21,00 --> 00:11:28,50
In a flashback, two stylish blondes ride bicycles down a street. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS99
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:35,50
They follow the charming, colorful street toward the sea. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS100
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:05,50
Elsewhere, a beautiful woman teaches gardening. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS101
00:12:17,00 --> 00:12:24,50
Taking a disc of naan, he notices his host's eyes closed in prayer. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS102
00:12:21,00 --> 00:12:26,50
The writer sets down the bread. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS106
00:13:02,00 --> 00:13:07,50
She tells her sons the story. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS111
00:13:15,00 --> 00:13:21,50
The lovely woman snuggles on a bed with her two boys. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS112
00:13:19,00 --> 00:13:23,50
So Krishna opened his mouth. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS115
00:13:26,00 --> 00:13:32,50
She saw in Krishna's mouth the whole entire universe. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS116
00:13:30,00 --> 00:13:35,50
Young SOMEONE screws his mouth up thoughtfully. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS117
00:13:33,00 --> 00:13:40,50
Later in the dark, SOMEONE sits hunched beneath the sheet and uses a flashlight. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS118
00:13:38,00 --> 00:13:42,50
His brother sleeping beside him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS119
00:13:39,00 --> 00:13:46,50
SOMEONE turns the pages of a comic book depicting the Krishna story. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS120
00:13:48,00 --> 00:13:55,50
A large panel illustrates a smiling Krishna holding his mouth open. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS121
00:13:52,00 --> 00:13:59,50
Beyond his lips swirl colorful galaxies, planets, and stars. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS122
00:13:56,00 --> 00:14:03,50
As we peer closely at the universe between Krishna's lips, it moves. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS124
00:14:32,00 --> 00:14:36,50
With the boy's father. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS125
00:15:00,00 --> 00:15:06,50
A barge carrying a depiction of Vishnu floats passed SOMEONE's mother. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS126
00:15:17,00 --> 00:15:25,50
Our view lifts up and away from the floating candles to the stars twinkling in the night's sky. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS127
00:15:22,00 --> 00:15:29,50
Our view spins, then descends to a sunny day in a lush valley. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS128
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:53,50
Facing his sad-eyed, skinny brother, an adolescent SOMEONE points out a church at the rim of the misty valley. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS129
00:15:50,00 --> 00:15:56,50
It overlooks a tranquil river winding through verdant lands. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS130
00:15:54,00 --> 00:15:59,50
Now, as we peer out the church's open door. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS131
00:15:56,00 --> 00:16:02,50
SOMEONE leans into view with wide eyes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS132
00:15:59,00 --> 00:16:05,50
He slips inside, then creeps to an alcove. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS133
00:16:02,00 --> 00:16:12,50
Scooping up water from a basin with his hand, he takes a few sips then turns and takes in the space with a curious reverent gaze. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS134
00:16:14,00 --> 00:16:23,50
Now SOMEONE stares across the pews at the alter where golden candlesticks surround a crucified Jesus statue. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS135
00:16:20,00 --> 00:16:27,50
His gaze drifts along a high row of paintings and fixates on one. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS137
00:16:32,00 --> 00:16:38,50
The priest approaches the boy and offers a glass of water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS138
00:16:36,00 --> 00:16:43,50
Staring at the glass, SOMEONE cautiously accepts the drink and takes a tiny sip. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS139
00:16:42,00 --> 00:16:50,50
He glances at the priest then holds out a hand and regards the painting of Jesus being crucified. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS140
00:17:22,00 --> 00:17:28,50
Now young SOMEONE sits beside a glimmering river. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS141
00:17:29,00 --> 00:17:35,50
He stands and stumbles into the water. Now in the church. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS142
00:17:56,00 --> 00:18:04,50
SOMEONE removes his hand from a Vishnu figure and presses his palms together in Christian prayer. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS143
00:18:01,00 --> 00:18:06,50
He turns off a lamp and goes to bed. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS144
00:18:11,00 --> 00:18:23,50
Now young SOMEONE walks down a dirt road lined with grimy homes. Looking right, he sees dozens of kneeling men bowing, performing Salah in the mosque's courtyard. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS145
00:18:29,00 --> 00:18:36,50
SOMEONE watches from outside the gate, then slowly moves towards to courtyard congregation. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS146
00:18:37,00 --> 00:18:42,50
Speakers sit atop the mosque's tower. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS147
00:18:42,00 --> 00:18:48,50
Now at home, the young Indian performs Salah alone. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS148
00:19:03,00 --> 00:19:08,50
Later at the dinner table with his family. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS149
00:19:05,00 --> 00:19:11,50
SOMEONE crosses himself and prays as his family begins dining. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS150
00:19:08,00 --> 00:19:13,50
His father watches him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS151
00:20:17,00 --> 00:20:22,50
Gita nods and swallows her food. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS152
00:20:28,00 --> 00:20:32,50
She touches her chest. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS153
00:20:44,00 --> 00:20:49,50
He glances between his sons. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS154
00:20:48,00 --> 00:20:52,50
SOMEONE nods gently at his father. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS155
00:20:51,00 --> 00:20:56,50
His beautiful mother eyes her family. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS156
00:20:54,00 --> 00:21:00,50
Slowly lifting his sheepish gaze, SOMEONE looks around the table. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS157
00:21:00,00 --> 00:21:07,50
His father stops eating and faces his wife who returns an amused smile. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS158
00:21:04,00 --> 00:21:10,50
In present day, SOMEONE and the writer leave his house. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS159
00:21:29,00 --> 00:21:35,50
At the zoo, young SOMEONE leads SOMEONE into a shadowy back room. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS160
00:21:37,00 --> 00:21:42,50
SOMEONE continues into a caged area. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS161
00:21:41,00 --> 00:21:46,50
He grabs handfuls of raw meat from a table. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS162
00:21:46,00 --> 00:21:51,50
He turns a wheel near a gate. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS163
00:22:18,00 --> 00:22:21,50
At the zoo. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS164
00:22:28,00 --> 00:22:34,50
SOMEONE crouches before the gate with SOMEONE kneeling behind. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS165
00:22:31,00 --> 00:22:39,50
A Bengal tiger steps beneath the lifted gate and enters the narrow corridor before them. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS166
00:22:36,00 --> 00:22:42,50
SOMEONE turns and runs but SOMEONE remains still. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS167
00:22:39,00 --> 00:22:43,50
Stopping near the end. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS168
00:22:40,00 --> 00:22:45,50
The beautiful animal stares at the boy. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS169
00:22:44,00 --> 00:22:50,50
SOMEONE extends a handful of meat between the bars. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS170
00:22:51,00 --> 00:23:00,50
SOMEONE glances at a gated off entrance to his side, then slowly stalks down the feeding corridor toward SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS171
00:23:02,00 --> 00:23:09,50
The young boy remains still as the tiger nears. Its long striped tail swaying behind. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS172
00:23:07,00 --> 00:23:14,50
Keeping his eyes fixed on SOMEONE Parker's, SOMEONE's hand trembles with the slab of meat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS173
00:23:12,00 --> 00:23:17,50
The magnificent tiger stops a foot away. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS174
00:23:14,00 --> 00:23:20,50
His ears point backward as he extends his nose to the meat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS175
00:23:19,00 --> 00:23:23,50
SOMEONE's father hurries inside. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS176
00:23:21,00 --> 00:23:26,50
The tiger bolts away. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS177
00:23:46,00 --> 00:23:51,50
Glaring, his father shakes his head and faces SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS178
00:23:50,00 --> 00:23:54,50
SOMEONE runs off. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS179
00:23:52,00 --> 00:23:58,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch a zoo keeper enter the room carrying a live goat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS180
00:23:56,00 --> 00:24:00,50
He sets it before the feeding corridor. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS181
00:23:58,00 --> 00:24:05,50
Securing its rope leash to the bars, Selvam faces SOMEONE's father. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS185
00:24:27,00 --> 00:24:31,50
SOMEONE's mother enters. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS186
00:24:36,00 --> 00:24:40,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS187
00:24:56,00 --> 00:25:04,50
SOMEONE crosses his arms and stares ahead as Selvam spins the metal wheel. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS188
00:25:01,00 --> 00:25:07,50
At the end of the corridor the tiger's gate slides open. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS189
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:09,50
The family stands together facing the gate. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS190
00:25:07,00 --> 00:25:13,50
The alarmed goat shakes its head and ears, then spins in a circle. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS191
00:25:13,00 --> 00:25:20,50
SOMEONE slowly turns the corner and eyes the goat with his mouth hanging open. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS192
00:25:17,00 --> 00:25:23,50
Lowering his head, the intimidating beast stalks forward. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS193
00:25:23,00 --> 00:25:29,50
SOMEONE watches as he suddenly springs toward his prey. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS194
00:25:28,00 --> 00:25:35,50
SOMEONE winces and SOMEONE pulls SOMEONE against her as SOMEONE remains completely still. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS195
00:25:33,00 --> 00:25:40,50
With the goat now on the other side of the bars, SOMEONE pulls it back toward his cage. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS196
00:25:37,00 --> 00:25:42,50
With his head pressed to his mother's bosom. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS197
00:25:39,00 --> 00:25:45,50
SOMEONE watches the carnivore drag his kill. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS199
00:25:55,00 --> 00:26:02,50
Now in bed, teenage SOMEONE reads a Dostoyevsky novel as SOMEONE awakes to an alarm. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS200
00:26:01,00 --> 00:26:08,50
Later outside their school, young students rush passed SOMEONE through the rain. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS201
00:26:23,00 --> 00:26:29,50
Now SOMEONE sits on a beam below an ocean SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS202
00:26:26,00 --> 00:26:31,50
He reads L'Etranger by Albert Camus. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS203
00:26:38,00 --> 00:26:46,50
Now a round-faced teenage beauty dances with other girls wearing a vibrant red saari. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS204
00:26:43,00 --> 00:26:49,50
SOMEONE plays the dholak drum and watches her closely. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS205
00:26:55,00 --> 00:27:07,50
An older teacher sits crossed-legged and chants as teenage girls perform a lively dance. The round-faced girl spins rapidly, catching SOMEONE's gaze on several twirls. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS206
00:27:08,00 --> 00:27:13,50
SOMEONE glances at the teacher as the dance slows. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS207
00:27:33,00 --> 00:27:44,50
Keeping her hands on her hips, the round-faced beauty steps forward. SOMEONE stares at her with mesmerized eyes. His mouth hanging open slightly. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS208
00:27:42,00 --> 00:27:47,50
The teacher breaks his trance. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS209
00:27:47,00 --> 00:27:52,50
SOMEONE closes his lips and glances at SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS210
00:27:50,00 --> 00:27:55,50
She keeps her eyes cast down as her classmates smile. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS211
00:27:53,00 --> 00:28:01,50
Later in a bustling marketplace, SOMEONE spies on SOMEONE as she shops with friends. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS212
00:27:58,00 --> 00:28:10,50
A girl spots him and he quickly ducks behind colorful hanging items. As SOMEONE and her friends move on, SOMEONE attempts to follow them with the drum satchel draped over his shoulder. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS213
00:28:07,00 --> 00:28:20,50
He exits the market and stops, searching in both directions. Now SOMEONE scurries through a section of tall root-like banyan trees where SOMEONE awaits with her friends. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS214
00:28:23,00 --> 00:28:29,50
SOMEONE stares at the ground then forms a bowl with his hands. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS215
00:28:28,00 --> 00:28:32,50
She furrows her brow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS216
00:28:46,00 --> 00:28:50,50
SOMEONE smiles and looks down. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS217
00:28:53,00 --> 00:28:57,50
He forms the bowl. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS218
00:29:09,00 --> 00:29:17,50
Surrounded by banyan trees, SOMEONE glances down then shows SOMEONE a warm smile. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS219
00:29:15,00 --> 00:29:21,50
Later at the zoo, SOMEONE and SOMEONE view the tiger lounge. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS220
00:29:27,00 --> 00:29:31,50
He faces them with his ears pointed back. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS221
00:29:35,00 --> 00:29:40,50
SOMEONE tilts her head and looks up. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS222
00:29:39,00 --> 00:29:46,50
A big smile spreads on SOMEONE's face and he glances between her and the tiger. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS223
00:29:44,00 --> 00:29:52,50
Later at the dinner table, SOMEONE stares off in a trance, smiling to himself as his father speaks. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS224
00:30:14,00 --> 00:30:19,50
SOMEONE shakes his head with a furrowed brow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS225
00:30:24,00 --> 00:30:28,50
His mother looks down. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS226
00:30:58,00 --> 00:31:10,50
SOMEONE stares longingly at his mother who catches SOMEONE's humorless gaze. Later beneath the ocean SOMEONE, SOMEONE sits with SOMEONE as she ties pink string around his wrist. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS227
00:31:19,00 --> 00:31:23,50
The young beauty takes his hand. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS228
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:34,50
Now on a freighter ship, SOMEONE leans on the rail of the main deck. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS229
00:31:31,00 --> 00:31:39,50
He gazes back at the brilliant sun setting beyond his homeland on the horizon. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS230
00:31:40,00 --> 00:31:46,50
He faces forward then looks back at the sun as his mother approaches. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS231
00:31:45,00 --> 00:31:52,50
SOMEONE stops beside her boy, following his gaze to the setting sun. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS232
00:31:51,00 --> 00:31:55,50
SOMEONE shifts his weight. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS233
00:32:05,00 --> 00:32:10,50
SOMEONE eyes her son then walks away. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS234
00:32:08,00 --> 00:32:14,50
Blinking rapidly, SOMEONE keeps his gaze fixed on the horizon. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS235
00:32:11,00 --> 00:32:17,50
Now in the eating quarters, SOMEONE faces a husky, larged-nosed cook. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS239
00:32:30,00 --> 00:32:36,50
The cook reaches behind the counter and puts a morsel of parsley on the plate. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS240
00:32:37,00 --> 00:32:42,50
She asked if you have something vegetarian. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS241
00:32:41,00 --> 00:32:45,50
The cook glances at the plate. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS242
00:32:44,00 --> 00:32:51,50
The cow that produced this liver was vegetarian, the pigs that went into these sausages were vegetarian. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS243
00:32:49,00 --> 00:32:54,50
Very funny but my wife doesn't eat liver. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS244
00:32:52,00 --> 00:32:57,50
The cook shrugs and grabs another plate. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS245
00:33:00,00 --> 00:33:06,50
Then she can eat the sausage, the rice and the gravy or you can cook your own food. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS246
00:33:05,00 --> 00:33:10,50
How dare you talk to my wife like that. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS248
00:33:11,00 --> 00:33:16,50
I cook for sailors not curry eaters. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS249
00:33:14,00 --> 00:33:19,50
SOMEONE grabs the cook. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS254
00:33:24,00 --> 00:33:30,50
The sailors pull SOMEONE away from the crazy-eyed cook. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS255
00:33:28,00 --> 00:33:35,50
Now the family sits with their eyes cast down as a teenage Asian boy joins them. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS256
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:53,50
SOMEONE eyes the amiable boy and shakes his head with a smile. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS257
00:33:50,00 --> 00:34:00,50
Now below the deck, two orangutans sit in a four by four cage. The larger one takes the smaller one's hand and comforts it. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS258
00:33:58,00 --> 00:34:04,50
SOMEONE sits outside the cage, watching them closely and eating a banana. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS259
00:34:02,00 --> 00:34:09,50
His father dumps food in an ostrich pen as a camel and giraffe watch attentively. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS260
00:34:06,00 --> 00:34:12,50
Stacks of animal crates line the cargo hold. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS261
00:34:40,00 --> 00:34:47,50
SOMEONE stares at his son as he shoves pills into a banana. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS262
00:34:44,00 --> 00:34:49,50
SOMEONE shifts his gaze to the ship's floor. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS263
00:34:52,00 --> 00:34:56,50
Present day on a park bench. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS264
00:34:59,00 --> 00:35:06,50
The writer watches him with a furrowed brow as adult SOMEONE stares into the river before them. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS265
00:35:25,00 --> 00:35:29,50
The writer nods and grins. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS267
00:35:32,00 --> 00:35:37,50
Facing the river, he leans forward. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS268
00:35:43,00 --> 00:35:48,50
A map of the South Pacific fills the screen. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS269
00:35:51,00 --> 00:35:55,50
We zoom to the Mariana trench. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS270
00:35:57,00 --> 00:36:07,50
As we push through thick, churning storm clouds, deck lights illuminate a freighter in the night. Heavy rains pound on the swelling ocean. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS271
00:36:08,00 --> 00:36:18,50
Ramping off a wave, the ship's bow lands hard on the seething surface. Water bursts upwards as it skips to another wave. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS272
00:36:17,00 --> 00:36:23,50
Below deck, SOMEONE slowly awakes in his cabin bunk. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS273
00:36:25,00 --> 00:36:31,50
His eyes dart about. His parents sleep in a bed across the room. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS274
00:36:30,00 --> 00:36:35,50
He leans down to the bottom bunk and shakes his sleeping brother. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS275
00:36:50,00 --> 00:36:57,50
SOMEONE quickly pulls himself into his bunk as his mother rolls over. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS276
00:36:54,00 --> 00:36:59,50
The hands on a travel clock point to 1:17. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS277
00:37:01,00 --> 00:37:06,50
SOMEONE climbs a flight of stairs and enters a corridor. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS278
00:37:05,00 --> 00:37:10,50
The door swings shut behind him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS279
00:37:07,00 --> 00:37:13,50
He staggers and steadies himself on a railing as he moves along. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS280
00:37:10,00 --> 00:37:15,50
Turning, he faces a door with a port hole. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS281
00:37:14,00 --> 00:37:19,50
SOMEONE peers through at the lightning flashing in the darkness. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS282
00:37:18,00 --> 00:37:25,50
He turns a latch and the door swings open. The wind and rain lash in at him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS283
00:37:23,00 --> 00:37:34,50
Venturing out, SOMEONE leans over a railing and scans his tempestuous surroundings. As he steps along a walkway, his feet slide on the wet flooring. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS284
00:37:32,00 --> 00:37:38,50
He stumbles as the ship violently rocks and he catches himself on a banister. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS285
00:37:38,00 --> 00:37:45,50
SOMEONE climbs stairs to the neck deck and slides on his bare feet again. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS286
00:37:44,00 --> 00:37:51,50
He catches himself on a railing and clings to it as he beams down at the churning, roiling ocean. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS287
00:37:51,00 --> 00:37:57,50
Stepping back, he looks skyward and waves his arms giddily. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS288
00:37:58,00 --> 00:38:04,50
He struggles to perform a worshipful dance. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS292
00:38:10,00 --> 00:38:21,50
Getting to his feet, he notices a red light flashing from a high post. Falling again, SOMEONE slides into a barrier at the edge of the upper deck. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS294
00:38:20,00 --> 00:38:29,50
He braces himself and climbs to his feet. The ship plunges into a wave sending water crashing over him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS295
00:38:26,00 --> 00:38:32,50
It leaves the upper deck flooded as he recovers. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS298
00:38:33,00 --> 00:38:40,50
SOMEONE watches two sailors moving frantically below with flashlights. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS300
00:38:41,00 --> 00:38:46,50
SOMEONE reaches for them futilely as they wash overboard. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS301
00:38:44,00 --> 00:38:49,50
Sobered, he races back inside. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS303
00:38:51,00 --> 00:38:55,50
He staggers through a corridor. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS304
00:38:56,00 --> 00:39:04,50
Finding his level flooded, he dives into the water and swims. He passes a panicking zebra. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS306
00:39:05,00 --> 00:39:08,50
SOMEONE surfaces. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS307
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:11,50
Gasping then submerges himself and swims onward. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS308
00:39:09,00 --> 00:39:16,50
The teen passes through a dark section lit only by the pulsing red emergency lights. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS309
00:39:14,00 --> 00:39:20,50
Reaching a door at the end of the corridor, he struggles to open it. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS310
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:24,50
It springs open releasing a powerful current of water and air bubbles. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS311
00:39:23,00 --> 00:39:31,50
SOMEONE hangs onto the door frame and tries futilely to pull himself into his family's quarters. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS312
00:39:28,00 --> 00:39:35,50
Releasing it, he drifts back down the corridor and returns to the deck. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS313
00:39:32,00 --> 00:39:36,50
An animal leaps passed him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS315
00:39:35,00 --> 00:39:43,50
A bird seeks refuge in the nearby tower. Other animals struggle for footing on the rocking ship. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS318
00:39:52,00 --> 00:39:57,50
A sailor gives him a life jacket. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS319
00:39:56,00 --> 00:40:01,50
The Buddhist struggles to free a lifeboat carrying the cook. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS321
00:40:01,00 --> 00:40:06,50
The Buddhist leaps to SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS322
00:40:10,00 --> 00:40:21,50
The Buddhist, captain and the sailor shove him onto the boat. SOMEONE tumbles across the canvas cover and hangs off the edge. The cook signals to the men on the ship. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS324
00:40:20,00 --> 00:40:26,50
SOMEONE climbs back up and scrambles around as the others shout at him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS327
00:40:31,00 --> 00:40:38,50
As SOMEONE clings to one set of lines, the cook unfastens another. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS328
00:40:35,00 --> 00:40:41,50
The Buddhist points as the zebra at the railing of an upper deck. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS331
00:40:42,00 --> 00:40:47,50
The boat tips and the cook falls off. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS333
00:40:46,00 --> 00:40:52,50
SOMEONE loses his grip on the lines and the lifeboat plummets to the sea. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS334
00:40:49,00 --> 00:41:02,50
SOMEONE lands on his belly and struggles to hold on as the boat bucks on the churning waters. SOMEONE slides backward, landing at a wave that buoys him back on the boat again. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS335
00:40:59,00 --> 00:41:07,50
It carries him past the shouting men at the edge of the ship's deck. A giant wave washes them from view. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS336
00:41:05,00 --> 00:41:13,50
The lifeboat carries SOMEONE through the wreckage. A boom sweeps low over his head. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS337
00:41:10,00 --> 00:41:27,50
Escaping the wreckage, the lifeboat briefly capsizes. As it rights itself, we find SOMEONE holding on tightly and the zebra lying inside. SOMEONE peers across the giant waves and locates the sinking ship. He notices a whistle on his life jacket and blows it. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS338
00:41:27,00 --> 00:41:32,50
He frantically waves his arm at the ship. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS340
00:41:33,00 --> 00:41:41,50
Peering into the seemingly endless expanse of rolling waves, SOMEONE spots a figure in the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS342
00:41:46,00 --> 00:41:58,50
Finding a life preserver, he climbs up on the canvas secured tautly over the front half of the boat. He casts the flotation device out into the water with all his might. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS343
00:41:55,00 --> 00:42:05,50
The lights of the capsizing ship twinkle and pulse in the distance as SOMEONE uses a line to reel in the drowning figure. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS345
00:42:05,00 --> 00:42:14,50
He slides a long handles oar out from beneath the canvas cover and extends it over the water toward the life preserver. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS347
00:42:13,00 --> 00:42:20,50
Two paws and a large furry head emerge from the center of the ring. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS350
00:42:25,00 --> 00:42:33,50
SOMEONE jabs futilely at the tiger with the oar. A wave carries the beast to the lifeboat's rim. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS351
00:42:30,00 --> 00:42:47,50
SOMEONE grabs on and climbs partially aboard. Scrambling to the prow, SOMEONE dives into the water. Getting his bearings, he looks back at the lifeboat, then gazes out over the roiling water. A giant wave looms stories high above him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS352
00:42:46,00 --> 00:42:54,50
SOMEONE takes a deep breath and submerges. The wave briefly rolls him as it passes by. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS353
00:42:54,00 --> 00:43:02,50
Staying under, SOMEONE swims past a shark as he makes his way beyond the lifeboat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS354
00:43:05,00 --> 00:43:11,50
Turning, he finds himself facing the completely submerged ship. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS355
00:43:10,00 --> 00:43:15,50
The teen halts and hovers in the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS356
00:43:12,00 --> 00:43:18,50
His limbs splayed as he stares at the enormous craft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS357
00:43:15,00 --> 00:43:21,50
The deck lights glow as the ocean's depths claim the vessel. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS358
00:43:20,00 --> 00:43:26,50
SOMEONE looks on helplessly as the ship descends into the deep. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS360
00:43:26,00 --> 00:43:32,50
Turning away, he swims. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS362
00:43:38,00 --> 00:43:45,50
Two other sharks fight over a fresh kill beneath him. The tempestuous waters swirl over SOMEONE as he makes his way back to the surface. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS363
00:43:45,00 --> 00:43:50,50
The teen thrusts his head above water and gasps. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS364
00:43:52,00 --> 00:43:58,50
With long strokes, he swims back to the lifeboat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS365
00:44:00,00 --> 00:44:09,50
SOMEONE grabs for a mast jutting five feet from the prow, but a passing wave compromises his reach. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS366
00:44:06,00 --> 00:44:11,50
Another carries him to the boat's rim. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS367
00:44:12,00 --> 00:44:20,50
SOMEONE climbs on to the deck with the zebra who lies curled up on its side on one end. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS368
00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:22,50
Knee-deep water sloshes around the deck. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS369
00:44:20,00 --> 00:44:26,50
SOMEONE climbs back on the canvas cover, then scrambles to the prow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS370
00:44:24,00 --> 00:44:29,50
He leans far out, clinging to the mast. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS371
00:44:26,00 --> 00:44:32,50
A wave sends a blast of spray into his face. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS372
00:44:29,00 --> 00:44:36,50
Shaking his head, he catches his breath and peers down into the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS373
00:44:45,00 --> 00:44:50,50
Another blast of sea-spray drenches the teen. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS374
00:44:54,00 --> 00:45:01,50
He watches helplessly as the ship sinks further beneath the churning waves. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS375
00:44:58,00 --> 00:45:04,50
The ocean's rippling surface distorts SOMEONE's view of the lost vessel. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS376
00:45:02,00 --> 00:45:10,50
We drift up and away from the boy as the lifeboat carries him over the ship's watery grave. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS377
00:45:10,00 --> 00:45:17,50
A section at a time, the deck lights flicker then blink out. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS378
00:45:14,00 --> 00:45:21,50
Lightning flashes then diminishes leaving the boy alone in the darkness. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS380
00:45:22,00 --> 00:45:33,50
The next day a seemingly endless expanse of choppy waves roll beneath a low ceiling of storm clouds. The lifeboat bobs amidst the whitecaps. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS381
00:45:33,00 --> 00:45:43,50
With the life preserver looped over the prow beam, a huddled, shivering SOMEONE sits in the rain while clinging to the mast with his hands. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS382
00:45:40,00 --> 00:45:45,50
His feet brace against the front of the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS383
00:45:43,00 --> 00:45:48,50
A shark passes beneath him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS384
00:45:46,00 --> 00:45:54,50
Glancing down at it, SOMEONE struggles his way to the canvas covered bow and rolls over on top of the beam. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS385
00:45:56,00 --> 00:46:02,50
Lifting the edge of the canvas, he peers inside. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS386
00:45:59,00 --> 00:46:04,50
Water sloshes over the floor of the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS387
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:10,50
The water splashes the zebra who still lies curled up on the wooden bench-like seats rimming the far end. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS388
00:46:07,00 --> 00:46:15,50
One of its hind legs lies unnaturally straight as it drags its haunch along the bench. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS389
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:18,50
Later, SOMEONE uses a bucket to bail water from the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS390
00:46:15,00 --> 00:46:22,50
With weary, dogged motions, he scoops out one bucketful after another. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS391
00:46:20,00 --> 00:46:27,50
SOMEONE drops the bucket and collapses on the bench near the canvas cover's edge. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS392
00:46:24,00 --> 00:46:30,50
He leans back, his arms draped on the boat's rim and cover. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS393
00:46:30,00 --> 00:46:34,50
SOMEONE lifts his head. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS394
00:46:32,00 --> 00:46:37,50
A hyena emerges from the canvas shelter. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS395
00:46:35,00 --> 00:46:44,50
The hyena darts back under the canvas. As SOMEONE takes up a long handles oar and jumps to the canvas cover. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS396
00:46:41,00 --> 00:46:51,50
SOMEONE the hyena darts out. It leaps at SOMEONE clumsily and snaps at the oar. Its jaws clamp on the oars paddle. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS397
00:46:48,00 --> 00:46:54,50
SOMEONE drops the oar and retreats to the prow beam. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS398
00:46:51,00 --> 00:46:58,50
Clinging by his arms, he swings himself around so his legs dangle over the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS399
00:46:56,00 --> 00:47:03,50
Curling his abdominal muscles, he lifts his legs and fits them through the life preserver. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS400
00:47:01,00 --> 00:47:14,50
From his makeshift seat, he watches SOMEONE mid-boat as the hyena tries to climb up onto the canvas. The beast makes it only half way up, its hind legs staggering with the rocking of the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS401
00:47:14,00 --> 00:47:20,50
The spotted hyena keeps its four paws on the canvas, staring at SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS402
00:47:20,00 --> 00:47:26,50
It turns its head. SOMEONE follows its gaze, peering across the surf. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS403
00:47:24,00 --> 00:47:31,50
From a cresting wave, an orangutan rises into view, perched on a floating bundle. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS404
00:47:33,00 --> 00:47:40,50
SOMEONE ducks into the canvas and the zebra stretches its neck toward the approaching ape. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS405
00:47:38,00 --> 00:47:45,50
As she draws near, we recognize her flotation device has bananas wrapped in netting. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS406
00:47:42,00 --> 00:47:48,50
SOMEONE extends an oar to her and she climbs aboard. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS407
00:47:48,00 --> 00:47:55,50
The teen gives her a weary smile then leans over the side of the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS408
00:47:52,00 --> 00:47:58,50
In the water, the banana bundles float free of the netting. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS409
00:47:55,00 --> 00:48:00,50
SOMEONE gathers up the net. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS410
00:47:57,00 --> 00:48:03,50
Pulls out a stray banana and tosses it to Orange Juice. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS411
00:48:00,00 --> 00:48:08,50
The orangutan lets it bounce off her shoulder and land on the flooded floor of the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS412
00:48:05,00 --> 00:48:12,50
Facing SOMEONE, she grimly works her lips and folds her long arms. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS413
00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:14,50
Frowning, the teen peers out over the sea. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS414
00:48:15,00 --> 00:48:27,50
As SOMEONE faces her with a concerned expression, the orangutan lowers her gaze and sighs. Turning her head over her shoulder, she gazes off over the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS415
00:48:24,00 --> 00:48:29,50
SOMEONE blinks understandingly. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS416
00:48:30,00 --> 00:48:35,50
SOMEONE settles wearily onto the canvas. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS417
00:48:35,00 --> 00:48:40,50
He gives a resigned sigh. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS418
00:48:39,00 --> 00:48:47,50
Now flies swarm around the injured zebra, a thin white foam covering its lips. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS419
00:48:47,00 --> 00:48:52,50
Standing on the canvas cover, SOMEONE turns. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS420
00:48:57,00 --> 00:49:02,50
He drops to all fours and picks up the bucket. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS421
00:49:00,00 --> 00:49:05,50
Lying on his belly, he slams it against the boat's hull. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS422
00:49:04,00 --> 00:49:10,50
The hyena emerges from beneath the canvas. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS423
00:49:07,00 --> 00:49:12,50
Rediscovering SOMEONE, it leaps at him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS424
00:49:09,00 --> 00:49:15,50
The teen scrambles back and fends off SOMEONE with the oar. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS425
00:49:13,00 --> 00:49:17,50
The animal gnaws on its paddle. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS426
00:49:14,00 --> 00:49:28,50
Orange Juice scoots back on the bench and shrieks as SOMEONE bounds passed her and runs in circles. The hyena briefly leans over the edge the resumes its wild laps as SOMEONE stands ready with the oar. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS427
00:49:25,00 --> 00:49:32,50
SOMEONE stops at the center, his body convulsing. He vomits on the floor. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS428
00:49:32,00 --> 00:49:40,50
Licking his chops, he makes another try for SOMEONE but slumps weakly against the canvas. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS430
00:49:40,00 --> 00:49:46,50
The netting dangles from the base of the prow beam. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS431
00:49:43,00 --> 00:49:52,50
SOMEONE sits at the bow sharing a vigilant gaze with the hyena who remains back at the edge of the canvas. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS432
00:49:49,00 --> 00:49:55,50
The teen wavers wearily, his eyelids heavy. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS433
00:49:52,00 --> 00:49:57,50
Glancing over his shoulder. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS434
00:49:54,00 --> 00:50:00,50
SOMEONE bounds to the zebra and snaps at its injured hind leg. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS435
00:49:57,00 --> 00:50:02,50
The wounded animal kicks at the predator. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS436
00:50:07,00 --> 00:50:13,50
SOMEONE and Orange Juice watch helplessly as SOMEONE kills the zebra. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS438
00:50:19,00 --> 00:50:28,50
On a gently rolling current, SOMEONE sits in the makeshift seat at the boats prow, hugging the life preserver. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS439
00:50:25,00 --> 00:50:32,50
Dark circles shade his bleary eyes above his red, chapped cheeks. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS440
00:50:29,00 --> 00:50:34,50
SOMEONE's eyelids droop and he blinks himself awake. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS441
00:50:34,00 --> 00:50:38,50
The teen nods off again. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS442
00:50:35,00 --> 00:50:42,50
He falls back into the water, hanging by his knees from the life preserver. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS443
00:50:44,00 --> 00:50:49,50
Waking, he jolts up and gasps. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS444
00:50:46,00 --> 00:50:52,50
The sputtering teen manages to sit up and catch his breath. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS445
00:50:49,00 --> 00:50:56,50
A line of saliva streams from his mouth as he looks around and recovers. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS446
00:50:53,00 --> 00:50:58,50
In the boat, the zebra lies dead. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS447
00:50:56,00 --> 00:51:03,50
Orange Juice slumps against the edge of the canvas cover taking slow, deep breaths. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS448
00:51:10,00 --> 00:51:22,50
He lifts away a hatch beneath the canvas cover and finds a duffle inside. Opening it, he finds a red booklet titled, "Survival at Sea" lying atop an array of supplies. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS449
00:51:20,00 --> 00:51:26,50
SOMEONE takes it out and flips through pages illustrated with diagrams. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS450
00:51:24,00 --> 00:51:33,50
Lifting another hatch, the teen finds it packed with life jackets. He takes one out and tosses it to Orange Juice. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS451
00:51:34,00 --> 00:51:40,50
The orangutan picks it up, turning it in her hands and feet as she examines it. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS452
00:51:38,00 --> 00:51:44,50
Beyond her, SOMEONE digs out several more life jackets. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS453
00:51:41,00 --> 00:51:47,50
Orange Juice gives hers a shake, the throws it down. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS454
00:51:46,00 --> 00:51:54,50
Later, using ropes and netting, he bundles the life jackets together into a small, makeshift raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS455
00:51:51,00 --> 00:51:58,50
The life preserver crowns it and three long handled oars criss-cross out from it. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS456
00:51:55,00 --> 00:52:00,50
Forming six branch-like spokes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS457
00:51:58,00 --> 00:52:03,50
As SOMEONE struggles to maneuver it into the water, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS458
00:52:00,00 --> 00:52:05,50
SOMEONE emerges from the canvas shelter. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS459
00:52:03,00 --> 00:52:12,50
Perching atop the zebra's carcass, he starts to take a bite. Orange Juice angrily thumps the rim of the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS460
00:52:09,00 --> 00:52:16,50
SOMEONE turns and stalks the orangutan who backs against the canvas' edge. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS461
00:52:13,00 --> 00:52:19,50
As SOMEONE lunges, she strikes him down. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS462
00:52:19,00 --> 00:52:25,50
As SOMEONE looks on, his jubilant smile fades. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS463
00:52:22,00 --> 00:52:30,50
Orange Juice peers down at the hyena, then sits on steadily and faces her human companion. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS464
00:52:27,00 --> 00:52:31,50
SOMEONE attacks her. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS465
00:52:32,00 --> 00:52:37,50
He drags her down to the floor and tears into her. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS466
00:52:34,00 --> 00:52:40,50
SOMEONE climbs over his raft and unsheathes a knife. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS467
00:52:37,00 --> 00:52:43,50
The hyena retreats to the boat's stern and cowers. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS468
00:52:40,00 --> 00:52:46,50
Our view sweeps down to Orange Juice's body as it grows still. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS469
00:52:44,00 --> 00:52:49,50
Blood stains the wood near her throat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS470
00:52:48,00 --> 00:52:54,50
As he stares down at her, SOMEONE's mournful expression hardens wrathfully. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS471
00:52:52,00 --> 00:52:57,50
Facing SOMEONE, he swings the knife. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS472
00:52:59,00 --> 00:53:15,50
The tiger springs out from the shelter beneath him. Landing on the zebra, SOMEONE kills the hyena with a wrench of his jaws. Behind him, SOMEONE scrambles for his makeshift raft. As he pushes it overboard, the tiger faces him with a snarl. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS473
00:53:14,00 --> 00:53:19,50
Standing, SOMEONE picks up the oar. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS474
00:53:18,00 --> 00:53:23,50
SOMEONE swats it from his grasp. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS475
00:53:20,00 --> 00:53:30,50
As the tiger climbs onto the canvas, SOMEONE curls up in a fetal position with his back to him and squeezes his eyes shut. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS476
00:53:30,00 --> 00:53:37,50
SOMEONE backs off, returning his attention to his kill. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS477
00:53:36,00 --> 00:53:43,50
SOMEONE leaps from the boat, following a rope, tethering the raft to the lifeboat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS478
00:53:41,00 --> 00:53:47,50
He tries to climb on top of the raft but it rolls under his weight. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS479
00:53:48,00 --> 00:53:55,50
Later, the boy persists as the bundle of life jackets loosens and rolls beneath his grasp. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS480
00:53:53,00 --> 00:53:57,50
He strikes it angrily. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS481
00:53:55,00 --> 00:54:03,50
Later still, he ties the life jacket to the end of an oar spoke, balancing the raft's buoyancy. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS482
00:54:04,00 --> 00:54:09,50
A shark swims passed as he works, spotting it. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS483
00:54:07,00 --> 00:54:12,50
The boy climbs on top of the raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS484
00:54:10,00 --> 00:54:16,50
Now SOMEONE lies still beneath the canvas shelter. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS485
00:54:14,00 --> 00:54:25,50
At the boat's prow, SOMEONE peaks in at the tiger, he lifts out the duffle of supplies, revealing a sizable stock of canned goods and boxed food beneath. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS486
00:54:22,00 --> 00:54:27,50
SOMEONE eagerly climbs in to retrieve them. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS487
00:54:27,00 --> 00:54:34,50
Now, perched at the prow of the lifeboat, SOMEONE drinks down the contents of a can. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS488
00:54:31,00 --> 00:54:39,50
He fits a plastic lid on top, then drops it into a sack nestled at the center of his makeshift raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS489
00:54:37,00 --> 00:54:43,50
SOMEONE takes a handful of cans from the supply hatch and drops those in as well. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS490
00:54:41,00 --> 00:54:47,50
Taking out small boxes, he chucks one in and opens the other. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS491
00:54:45,00 --> 00:54:50,50
Unwrapping a nutritional biscuit, he takes a big bite. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS492
00:54:51,00 --> 00:54:58,50
Looking down, he finds a sizable rat scurrying over the cans. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS493
00:54:56,00 --> 00:55:00,50
SOMEONE watches it as he eats. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS494
00:54:59,00 --> 00:55:03,50
SOMEONE lunges at him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS495
00:55:01,00 --> 00:55:06,50
The tiger halts, his claws sticking in the canvas. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS496
00:55:03,00 --> 00:55:11,50
He staggers back, snapping irritably at the fabric as a recoiling SOMEONE watches with wide eyes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS497
00:55:09,00 --> 00:55:16,50
SOMEONE turns his gaze out over the slate-grey water surrounding them. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS498
00:55:13,00 --> 00:55:21,50
He walks along the benches lining the boat's perimeter, pausing to paw at the zebra carcass. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS499
00:55:18,00 --> 00:55:24,50
With the animal distracted, SOMEONE starts to climb from the prow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS500
00:55:27,00 --> 00:55:35,50
SOMEONE charges forward, his head jetting up from the canvas' open flap at the bow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS501
00:55:32,00 --> 00:55:40,50
His enormous mass knocks SOMEONE onto his back on the canvas and the rat scurries along the cover. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS502
00:55:37,00 --> 00:55:48,50
SOMEONE emerges from the opening at the boat's center and climbs partway up on the canvas. The rat climbs up SOMEONE's arm and over his head. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS503
00:55:45,00 --> 00:55:49,50
The teen grabs the rodent. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS504
00:55:47,00 --> 00:55:52,50
SOMEONE pauses, staring hungrily. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS505
00:55:49,00 --> 00:55:55,50
SOMEONE throws the rat at the tiger who catches it in his mouth. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS506
00:55:53,00 --> 00:56:03,50
As SOMEONE slurps it down, SOMEONE jumps off the boat, he tries to push away on the raft but finds a line tethering him closely to the boat's prow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS507
00:56:02,00 --> 00:56:11,50
As he tries to release the line, SOMEONE lunges over the prow swiping his massive claws at his head. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS508
00:56:12,00 --> 00:56:22,50
SOMEONE ducks and the tiger nearly falls off the boat. Scraping his rear claws against the painted metal hull, the tiger climbs back aboard. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS509
00:56:19,00 --> 00:56:25,50
SOMEONE pushes off from the boat on his raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS510
00:56:22,00 --> 00:56:31,50
SOMEONE returns to the center of the boat as the frightened teen paddles away. Still securely connected by the tether. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS511
00:56:31,00 --> 00:56:37,50
Stopping a few yards from the boat, SOMEONE vomits into the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS512
00:56:34,00 --> 00:56:42,50
At night, a full moon shines through a gap in the clouds. On the boat, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS513
00:56:39,00 --> 00:56:45,50
SOMEONE drags the zebra carcass out of view. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS514
00:56:42,00 --> 00:56:47,50
From his raft, SOMEONE watches tearfully. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS515
00:56:45,00 --> 00:56:51,50
His sits cross-legged, his shoulders hunched. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS516
00:56:48,00 --> 00:56:56,50
SOMEONE peers out at him from the edge of the boat, his parted lips showing his long, sharp fangs. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS517
00:56:54,00 --> 00:57:00,50
The tiger calmly flops his tail as he observes the boy. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS518
00:56:57,00 --> 00:57:01,50
His lips quivering. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS519
00:56:58,00 --> 00:57:03,50
SOMEONE regards the tiger woefully. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS520
00:57:03,00 --> 00:57:08,50
Thick clouds drift before the enormous full moon. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS521
00:57:06,00 --> 00:57:16,50
As the boat and raft float of gently rolling waves, the clouds gradually blot out the moonlight leaving the boy and tiger in darkness. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS522
00:57:16,00 --> 00:57:22,50
Now a rising golden sun cuts through the dark. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS523
00:57:19,00 --> 00:57:29,50
As it illuminates the sky, we find the boat and raft adrift on perfectly still, glassy waters that reflect the cloudy sky. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS524
00:57:27,00 --> 00:57:31,50
As we peer down on them from above, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS525
00:57:29,00 --> 00:57:37,50
we find a perfect mirror-like image of the sun-lit clouds, undisturbed on the water's surface. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS526
00:57:34,00 --> 00:57:40,50
SOMEONE maintains his cross-legged pose as he watches the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS527
00:57:43,00 --> 00:57:47,50
Later he writes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS528
00:57:50,00 --> 00:57:55,50
He uses blank pages in the survival book. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS529
00:57:54,00 --> 00:57:58,50
He write with a pencil. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS530
00:57:57,00 --> 00:58:02,50
He presses the tip to the paper making a period. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS531
00:57:59,00 --> 00:58:07,50
Later, he puts the folded torn out in an empty water can and caps it. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS532
00:58:04,00 --> 00:58:09,50
As we watch from a distance. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS533
00:58:06,00 --> 00:58:13,50
SOMEONE stands from the center of his raft and throws the can with all his might. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS534
00:58:10,00 --> 00:58:17,50
It lands close to us and bobs peacefully in the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS535
00:58:14,00 --> 00:58:23,50
A birds-eye view shows the can about ten yards from SOMEONE's raft sending out gentle ripples over the current-less sea. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS536
00:58:21,00 --> 00:58:26,50
The boy turns, looking over his shoulder. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS537
00:58:25,00 --> 00:58:32,50
Tethered a few yards off, the lifeboat appears empty and peaceful. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS538
00:58:31,00 --> 00:58:39,50
SOMEONE emerges from the canvas shelter at the center of the boat, steps up on a seat below its rim, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS539
00:58:36,00 --> 00:58:41,50
He gazes out over the vast expanse of motion-less sunlit sea. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS543
00:58:47,00 --> 00:58:52,50
Watching him calmly, SOMEONE crouches down and takes up the rope tether. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS544
00:58:51,00 --> 00:58:57,50
Tugging hand over hand, he reels the boat closer. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS545
00:59:02,00 --> 00:59:08,50
At the prow, SOMEONE lifts the end of the canvas cover and peers beneath. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS546
00:59:06,00 --> 00:59:13,50
Nestled inside, SOMEONE snarls up at him but makes no move to rise. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS547
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:16,50
The carcasses of the zebra and the hyena flank the predator. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS549
00:59:15,00 --> 00:59:21,50
SOMEONE gives a small nod and gazes into the animal's fierce amber eyes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS550
00:59:21,00 --> 00:59:27,50
The teen lowers the flap, then pushes the boat off. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS551
00:59:37,00 --> 00:59:46,50
Standing along in the vast, isolated expanse, he turns his gaze toward the sunlit clouds above. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS552
01:00:01,00 --> 01:00:09,50
Now a map from the survival book illustrates the world's ocean currents with inter-swirling circles. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS553
01:00:06,00 --> 01:00:12,50
Reading it on his bobbing raft, SOMEONE looks over his shoulder. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS554
01:00:14,00 --> 01:00:20,50
Now SOMEONE reads through the book and follows its advice. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS555
01:00:31,00 --> 01:00:36,50
SOMEONE notices a rash along his side. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS556
01:00:37,00 --> 01:00:43,50
Later, he lies back, his hands over his face. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS557
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:53,50
He catches rain in the bucket, his open mouth, and cans in each hand. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS558
01:00:53,00 --> 01:00:59,50
SOMEONE collects water puddled on the canvas cover. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS559
01:00:59,00 --> 01:01:06,50
Now ten hash marks mar the hull off the prow. SOMEONE carves an eleventh with his knife. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS560
01:01:06,00 --> 01:01:11,50
Juxtaposed with the scenes, SOMEONE reads the book. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS561
01:01:09,00 --> 01:01:15,50
On an overcast day, he studies the book on his raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS562
01:01:13,00 --> 01:01:18,50
Pausing, he faces the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS563
01:01:35,00 --> 01:01:39,50
SOMEONE uses the canvas cone. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS564
01:02:42,00 --> 01:02:47,50
He drags the boat sideways over the waves. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS565
01:02:54,00 --> 01:02:59,50
He pulls the boat close. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS566
01:02:56,00 --> 01:03:03,50
SOMEONE emerges from his shelter, his ears back and his eyes wide. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS567
01:03:00,00 --> 01:03:06,50
Standing on the raft, SOMEONE rocks the boat by its prow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS568
01:03:09,00 --> 01:03:16,50
Blinking his amber eyes, the tiger hangs his head and convulses nauseously. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS569
01:03:14,00 --> 01:03:21,50
Gritting his teeth. SOMEONE pushes himself up on the boat's canvas cover. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS570
01:03:18,00 --> 01:03:26,50
He plants his feet wide apart and crouches over, getting his balance as he faces the tiger. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS571
01:03:26,00 --> 01:03:37,50
He lunges forward, his arms raised and spread. SOMEONE retreats to the boat's stern, sits on the rear seat and leans his face over the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS572
01:03:34,00 --> 01:03:40,50
SOMEONE watches him with wide eyes then reaches for his pants. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS573
01:03:37,00 --> 01:03:43,50
In front of his feet, urine hits the canvas. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS574
01:03:40,00 --> 01:03:46,50
Finishing, SOMEONE fiercely points downward. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS575
01:03:53,00 --> 01:04:00,50
SOMEONE opens his mouth wide in what appears to be a lazy yawn. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS576
01:03:57,00 --> 01:04:02,50
He turns, putting his tail to SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS577
01:03:59,00 --> 01:04:04,50
He sprays the teen in the face. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS578
01:04:02,00 --> 01:04:08,50
Sputtering, SOMEONE rolls off the canvas and the tiger reclaims it. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS579
01:04:10,00 --> 01:04:17,50
Now wearing the sea anchor as a hat that shades his face, neck and shoulders, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS580
01:04:14,00 --> 01:04:22,50
SOMEONE reels in a floating beach ball-sized device shaped like a chocolate kiss. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS581
01:04:19,00 --> 01:04:23,50
It collects dew. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS582
01:04:20,00 --> 01:04:26,50
Harvesting a plastic sack of fresh water, SOMEONE drinks through a straw. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS584
01:04:26,00 --> 01:04:30,50
He pours the rest into the bucket. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS585
01:04:28,00 --> 01:04:35,50
Later, he hefts the bucket into the lifeboat, setting it on the seat at the stern. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS586
01:04:32,00 --> 01:04:37,50
He raises the whistle to his lips. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS587
01:04:47,00 --> 01:04:52,50
The tiger emerges from his shelter. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS588
01:04:50,00 --> 01:04:55,50
SOMEONE pushes off as SOMEONE approaches the bucket. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS589
01:04:53,00 --> 01:04:59,50
The tiger bats it gently, sniffs it, and sticks his face in. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS590
01:05:05,00 --> 01:05:09,50
He writes in the survival book. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS591
01:05:29,00 --> 01:05:35,50
He baits a fishing hook with chewed biscuit then lowers it into the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS592
01:05:33,00 --> 01:05:39,50
From the lifeboat, SOMEONE licks his chops as he looks on. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS593
01:05:36,00 --> 01:05:40,50
SOMEONE faces him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS594
01:05:40,00 --> 01:05:45,50
The boy tries casting the line again. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS595
01:05:44,00 --> 01:05:51,50
Later, the low sun casts a shimmering beam across the sapphire blue ocean. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS596
01:05:49,00 --> 01:05:55,50
SOMEONE paces along the seats, peering into the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS597
01:05:52,00 --> 01:05:59,50
We glimpse a few green-tinted shapes swimming just below the surface. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS598
01:05:58,00 --> 01:06:04,50
Prepping his fishing line, SOMEONE glances up at the tiger. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS599
01:06:02,00 --> 01:06:07,50
A few fish splash the water surface. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS600
01:06:05,00 --> 01:06:09,50
SOMEONE jumps in. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS601
01:06:08,00 --> 01:06:13,50
SOMEONE looks up, his eyes wide. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS602
01:06:10,00 --> 01:06:18,50
From underwater, we watch SOMEONE paddling expertly among the darting fish. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS603
01:06:15,00 --> 01:06:21,50
His head held high, he snaps his jaws at one and misses. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS605
01:06:21,00 --> 01:06:26,50
Looking on, SOMEONE allows an amused smile. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS606
01:06:23,00 --> 01:06:30,50
Shaking water out of his pressed back ears, SOMEONE turns toward him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS607
01:06:28,00 --> 01:06:32,50
SOMEONE's smile fades. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS608
01:06:29,00 --> 01:06:36,50
Grabbing the tether, he tugs hand over fist to reel himself toward the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS609
01:06:33,00 --> 01:06:39,50
SOMEONE, paddles steadily, his gaze calm. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS610
01:06:39,00 --> 01:06:45,50
As SOMEONE nears the boat, the tiger draws close to him, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS611
01:06:42,00 --> 01:06:49,50
the teen climbs aboard just as the predator reaches his rafts outer spokes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS612
01:06:47,00 --> 01:06:52,50
The tiger tries to climb the raft, then the ship's hull. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS613
01:06:50,00 --> 01:06:55,50
His claws find no hold in its painted metal. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS614
01:06:54,00 --> 01:07:00,50
SOMEONE tries climbing aboard the raft from another spoke. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS615
01:06:57,00 --> 01:07:03,50
From the boat, SOMEONE struggles to heft up the raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS616
01:07:05,00 --> 01:07:16,50
Lying back, he uses one leg as extra leverage. The tiger hangs off the far spokes, adding to its weight then drops into the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS617
01:07:16,00 --> 01:07:21,50
With the raft resting on the canvas cover, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS618
01:07:18,00 --> 01:07:24,50
SOMEONE circles the boat, pawing at its hull. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS619
01:07:22,00 --> 01:07:27,50
SOMEONE takes a hatchet from the supply hatch. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS620
01:07:24,00 --> 01:07:31,50
He glances around, then beats SOMEONE at the side of the boat and raises the hatchet. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS621
01:07:32,00 --> 01:07:40,50
The tiger hangs on by ropes draped around the hull. Staring him down, SOMEONE's gaze softens. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS622
01:07:37,00 --> 01:07:43,50
The mostly submerged tiger stares up at him helplessly. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS623
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:46,50
Clinging to the ropes with his front claws. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS624
01:07:43,00 --> 01:07:49,50
Lowering the axe, SOMEONE gets down and kicks a seat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS626
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:57,50
As he looks around, SOMEONE paddles along the hull and tries again without success. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS627
01:07:54,00 --> 01:08:01,50
SOMEONE taps the boat's inner wall with his hatchet, the ducks into the canvas shelter. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS628
01:08:02,00 --> 01:08:08,50
He emerges, the stands and peers over the side of the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS629
01:08:09,00 --> 01:08:17,50
Standing between the two broken stumps of a broken off bench that once stretched across the boat, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS630
01:08:14,00 --> 01:08:19,50
SOMEONE looks around again. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS631
01:08:16,00 --> 01:08:22,50
He crouches and lifts up a hatch in front of his feet. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS632
01:08:19,00 --> 01:08:27,50
He sets the sizable pallet of wooden slats on the seat then reaches for his raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS633
01:08:27,00 --> 01:08:33,50
At dusk, our gaze drifts over the water, back to the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS634
01:08:30,00 --> 01:08:36,50
A beam of light dances up through the canvas. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS635
01:08:36,00 --> 01:08:42,50
SOMEONE emerges from the shelter with a flashlight in hand. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS636
01:08:39,00 --> 01:08:44,50
Shining it over the side, he finds SOMEONE clinging to the whole rope. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS639
01:08:45,00 --> 01:08:53,50
He lowers his raft, now larger, sturdier, and stocked with supplies, over the other side of the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS640
01:08:51,00 --> 01:08:59,50
He keeps hold of it with a rope as he crosses back to SOMEONE's side and puts the whistle to his lips. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS641
01:08:58,00 --> 01:09:03,50
He drops the slatted pallet overboard. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS642
01:09:01,00 --> 01:09:07,50
Attached to the boat with ropes, it forms a crude ladder. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS643
01:09:04,00 --> 01:09:10,50
As SOMEONE uses it to climb on board, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS644
01:09:07,00 --> 01:09:13,50
SOMEONE jumps off the other side and lands on his raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS645
01:09:10,00 --> 01:09:16,50
Standing on his hand-crafted flotation vessel, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS646
01:09:13,00 --> 01:09:19,50
the teen slowly lets out the tether connecting him to the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS647
01:09:17,00 --> 01:09:22,50
SOMEONE arrives back on board. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS648
01:09:19,00 --> 01:09:24,50
His soaked fur revealing his lean frame. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS649
01:09:22,00 --> 01:09:26,50
As he shakes himself off, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS650
01:09:23,00 --> 01:09:28,50
SOMEONE watches him carefully. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS651
01:09:25,00 --> 01:09:31,50
The tiger faces him, then steps down out of view. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS652
01:09:29,00 --> 01:09:36,50
Now, under sun-lit water, we watch fish swim beneath the improved raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS653
01:09:33,00 --> 01:09:42,50
Our view surfaces to find SOMEONE seated at one end making notes as he overlooks his stock of supplies. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS654
01:09:47,00 --> 01:09:51,50
He marks off an illustrated list. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS655
01:09:49,00 --> 01:09:54,50
Later, as he makes modifications to the raft, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS656
01:09:52,00 --> 01:09:59,50
an enormous green fish with a blue crest swims toward a net dangling from the humble craft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS657
01:09:57,00 --> 01:10:04,50
Re-attaching a life jacket to an oar beam, SOMEONE pauses and stares down at it. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS658
01:10:03,00 --> 01:10:09,50
The colorful fish swims right into the net. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS660
01:10:07,00 --> 01:10:15,50
Reaching down, SOMEONE gingerly scoops up the other sides, closing it off, then yanks the fish out of the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS661
01:10:14,00 --> 01:10:22,50
Straddling the new criss-crossing grid of oar beams, SOMEONE struggles to wrestle the fish into submission. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS662
01:10:20,00 --> 01:10:27,50
Roughly 2/3 his size, the fish thrashes wildly in his grasp. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS663
01:10:26,00 --> 01:10:40,50
SOMEONE pins it down on an oar beam, stretches one arm out and grabs the hatchet from the edge of the supply pallet. He sits up, holds the fish down with one hand and uses the other to club the fish with the blunt end of the hatchet. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS664
01:10:42,00 --> 01:10:47,50
He pauses, his features set in a savage glare. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS665
01:10:45,00 --> 01:10:52,50
The stunned fish feebly works its sharp-toothed jaws, blood seeps out beneath its gill. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS666
01:10:50,00 --> 01:10:55,50
SOMEONE stares with a softened remorseful gaze. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS667
01:10:53,00 --> 01:11:00,50
The fish grows still and its vibrant colors fade to dull, mottled shades of grey. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS668
01:11:05,00 --> 01:11:10,50
SOMEONE joins his hands and bows. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS669
01:11:17,00 --> 01:11:24,50
Later with his whistle between his lips, SOMEONE hefts the dead fish into the life boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS670
01:11:24,00 --> 01:11:29,50
SOMEONE creeps out from his shelter. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS672
01:11:28,00 --> 01:11:33,50
Standing on the raft grid, SOMEONE holds onto the boat's hull rope as he looks on. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS673
01:11:31,00 --> 01:11:37,50
The tiger chomps down on the fish and drags it back into the shelter. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS674
01:11:34,00 --> 01:11:39,50
The teen leans an ear close to the hull. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS675
01:11:40,00 --> 01:11:47,50
SOMEONE plants both hands on the painted metal, then gently pushes off. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS676
01:11:46,00 --> 01:11:57,50
On a starry night beneath a full moon, countless sea creatures swimming around the boat and raft give off a cerulean-hued phosphorescent glow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS677
01:11:54,00 --> 01:12:02,50
From the boat's prow, the tether sets off the same luminescence where it submerges beneath the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS678
01:12:00,00 --> 01:12:07,50
SOMEONE takes in the dazzling array of ocean life glowing beneath his raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS679
01:12:04,00 --> 01:12:10,50
A few jelly fish gracefully open and shut their bells. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS681
01:12:10,00 --> 01:12:15,50
Shifting to all fours on the grid, SOMEONE dips a hand into the ocean. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS682
01:12:12,00 --> 01:12:18,50
The water gives off a sparkling glow with each motion of his hand. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS684
01:12:19,00 --> 01:12:25,50
He turns and peers off into the distance with wide eyes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS685
01:12:22,00 --> 01:12:29,50
The teen looks around cautiously then returns his attention to the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS686
01:12:26,00 --> 01:12:35,50
His lips curl into a delighted child-like smile as he sets off the bright glow with strokes of his hand. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS688
01:12:34,00 --> 01:12:40,50
As his movements gain intensity, the resulting glow gathers mass and brightness. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS689
01:12:37,00 --> 01:12:43,50
It illuminates SOMEONE's grinning face as he plays. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS690
01:12:41,00 --> 01:12:46,50
The boy slows to a halt, his smile fading. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS692
01:12:45,00 --> 01:12:52,50
From the depths, a slowly glowing shape rapidly ascends between the raft and lifeboat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS693
01:12:49,00 --> 01:12:53,50
It's a humpback whale. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS694
01:12:51,00 --> 01:12:57,50
The creature leaps from the water as big as a small ship. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS695
01:12:55,00 --> 01:13:04,50
SOMEONE stares as the gigantic whale corkscrews through the air, glowing water streaming from its fins. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS696
01:13:01,00 --> 01:13:07,50
Descending, it lands on the tether and overturns the raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS697
01:13:05,00 --> 01:13:12,50
SOMEONE plunges into the water along with the boxes of biscuits and cans of water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS699
01:13:10,00 --> 01:13:16,50
he quickly makes his way back to the raft and climbs on board. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS700
01:13:14,00 --> 01:13:23,50
From high above, we watch the whale create a luminescent trail as it swims an arc around the lifeboat and raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS701
01:13:20,00 --> 01:13:27,50
It sprays brightly glowing water from its blow-hole then paddles away. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS703
01:13:32,00 --> 01:13:38,50
Now a long row of hash marks wraps around the prow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS704
01:13:40,00 --> 01:13:44,50
Wearing his shirt as a turban, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS705
01:13:41,00 --> 01:13:48,50
SOMEONE scratches yet another SOMEONE with his knife, then sheathes the blade. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS706
01:13:45,00 --> 01:13:53,50
He pushes himself along the hull, standing on a new triangular version of the raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS707
01:13:53,00 --> 01:14:00,50
Now holding the long wooden handle of a blunt-edged metal boat hook, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS708
01:13:57,00 --> 01:14:03,50
SOMEONE tries to pry a grappling tool from the canvas cover. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS709
01:14:00,00 --> 01:14:07,50
With no luck, he cautiously climbs from his raft onto the bow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS710
01:14:04,00 --> 01:14:13,50
As he tugs at the grappling tool, SOMEONE emerges from his covered quarters. He faces SOMEONE with fangs bared. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS711
01:14:13,00 --> 01:14:22,50
A fish suddenly whacks SOMEONE in the face. He falls onto the canvas and the fish flops beside him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS712
01:14:19,00 --> 01:14:25,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE growls as several more shoot over the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS713
01:14:22,00 --> 01:14:30,50
Glancing around with wide eyes, SOMEONE backs away from the tiger and grabs the flailing fish. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS714
01:14:28,00 --> 01:14:32,50
The teen stands at the bow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS715
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:41,50
He hurls the fish at the tiger's mouth and it spreads wings. The flying fish makes a sharp turn and glides along the ocean. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS716
01:14:39,00 --> 01:14:43,50
The both watch it fly away. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS717
01:14:40,00 --> 01:14:47,50
As they turn, hundreds of flying fish soar directly at them. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS718
01:14:46,00 --> 01:14:53,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE frantically swipes at the small fish as SOMEONE shields his face. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS719
01:14:51,00 --> 01:14:57,50
The fluttering silver creatures pelt his exposed torso. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS720
01:14:54,00 --> 01:15:02,50
Glancing between his arms, SOMEONE watches his carnivorous shipmate bat fish from the air. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS721
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:07,50
The frothy surface seethes around the boat as countless flying fish skip along the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS722
01:15:05,00 --> 01:15:11,50
SOMEONE flails atop the canvas, swinging his arms and body. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS723
01:15:09,00 --> 01:15:16,50
As two fish skitter side by side, a larger fish snatches one. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS724
01:15:13,00 --> 01:15:21,50
The companion fish dodges a breaching predator which we follow as it dips beneath the surface. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS725
01:15:18,00 --> 01:15:29,50
A large spiny, fish rapidly cuts through the ocean and leaps out, landing in the boat. SOMEONE SOMEONE swipes at it as SOMEONE's eyes grow wide. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS726
01:15:28,00 --> 01:15:42,50
SOMEONE wildly swings the boat hook, sticking the metal end in SOMEONE's mouth. Shaking his head, the tiger backs away and swipes at it. SOMEONE maintains his balance and keeps the boat hook between them. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS727
01:15:39,00 --> 01:15:44,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE bares his fangs. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS728
01:15:45,00 --> 01:16:00,50
The ferocious animal reluctantly backs away. Trembling, SOMEONE grabs his grappling tool and sticks it in the large fish. He heaves it onto the canvas and turns starting down SOMEONE SOMEONE as fish continue flying by. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS729
01:15:57,00 --> 01:16:04,50
Beneath the angry tiger, a pile of fish writhe on the boat floor. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS730
01:16:01,00 --> 01:16:07,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE backs away and focuses on the smaller fish. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS731
01:16:04,00 --> 01:16:14,50
Grabbing the handle of the boat hook, SOMEONE stands tall atop the canvas. His chest heaves as he glares down at the tiger. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS732
01:16:11,00 --> 01:16:18,50
A few fish continue passing by and they skip along the calming surface. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS733
01:16:20,00 --> 01:16:28,50
The triangular raft floats beside the lifeboat as SOMEONE watches SOMEONE SOMEONE feast. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS734
01:16:26,00 --> 01:16:33,50
At night, SOMEONE sits on the raft filleting the large fish he claimed. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS735
01:16:30,00 --> 01:16:37,50
The vegetarian warily places a piece of fish in his mouth. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS736
01:16:35,00 --> 01:16:42,50
Without hesitation, he eagerly slices a large hunk of meat from the fish. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS737
01:16:40,00 --> 01:16:45,50
SOMEONE takes in several big bites, filling his mouth. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS738
01:16:44,00 --> 01:16:50,50
Next day, he rubs ointment on a small shin wound and wraps it in gauze. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS739
01:17:06,00 --> 01:17:15,50
Sitting on his raft, SOMEONE uses a knife to carve a wood panel from the boat into a slim, pointy spear. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS740
01:17:12,00 --> 01:17:18,50
Now, standing on the canvas, he challenges SOMEONE SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS741
01:17:16,00 --> 01:17:24,50
The tiger stalks along the port side bench as the teen creeps closer with his spear in hand. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS742
01:17:21,00 --> 01:17:29,50
SOMEONE pokes the spear directly in front of SOMEONE's face and the beast pins back his ears to his head. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS744
01:17:29,00 --> 01:17:33,50
As the brave trainer inches forward, SOMEONE backs away. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS745
01:17:31,00 --> 01:17:38,50
Reaching the stern, the tiger lies down and kneads its massive paws on the port side bench. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS746
01:17:39,00 --> 01:17:46,50
He gets a claw stuck in the wood and rips it free then shows his teeth to SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS747
01:17:44,00 --> 01:17:50,50
The teen flinches but keeps his spear aimed at the tiger. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS748
01:17:47,00 --> 01:17:54,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE beats his tail against the bench, then sits up and raises a front paw. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS749
01:17:52,00 --> 01:17:56,50
He swats at the spear. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS750
01:17:57,00 --> 01:18:03,50
Standing his ground, SOMEONE slowly turns his head. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS751
01:18:01,00 --> 01:18:08,50
Watching the tiger out of the corner of his eye, he extends the spear toward him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS752
01:18:05,00 --> 01:18:10,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE swats it away. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS754
01:18:09,00 --> 01:18:14,50
As SOMEONE brings the spear back, the tiger angrily swipes with both paws and charges. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS756
01:18:17,00 --> 01:18:22,50
Facing the beast, SOMEONE glares and shakes the spear. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS757
01:18:21,00 --> 01:18:26,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE backs away and lies down at the stern. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS758
01:18:26,00 --> 01:18:32,50
SOMEONE's gaze softens as he watches the dominated cat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS759
01:18:30,00 --> 01:18:38,50
He reaches into a yellow pouch tied around his waist and pulls out a slab of fish. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS761
01:18:37,00 --> 01:18:42,50
Glancing between the tiger and the bait, he cautiously slides it onto the spear. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS762
01:18:40,00 --> 01:18:46,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE bares his teeth as SOMEONE slowly extends the reward. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS763
01:18:47,00 --> 01:18:55,50
Closing his mouth, SOMEONE SOMEONE wiggles his nose and lip at the dangling morsel. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS764
01:18:52,00 --> 01:18:58,50
SOMEONE keeps his eyes locked on the tiger's movement. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS765
01:18:55,00 --> 01:19:02,50
He guides the cat's face to the bench and slides the food off the spear. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS766
01:18:59,00 --> 01:19:04,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE happily indulges. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS767
01:19:01,00 --> 01:19:07,50
Their eyes connect as the tiger looks up. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS768
01:19:04,00 --> 01:19:09,50
And SOMEONE remains in the dominant position. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS769
01:19:08,00 --> 01:19:12,50
He holds out the spear. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS771
01:19:11,00 --> 01:19:18,50
SOMEONE taps the port side bench and tosses a piece of fish in the exact spot. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS772
01:19:15,00 --> 01:19:21,50
Stepping forward, SOMEONE SOMEONE gobbles it. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS773
01:19:18,00 --> 01:19:24,50
As he paws back toward the stern, he glares at the teen. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS774
01:19:22,00 --> 01:19:29,50
SOMEONE's mouth hangs open and he shows a slight grin, then glances at the other side of the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS775
01:19:30,00 --> 01:19:36,50
He taps the starboard side and tosses a piece of fish. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS776
01:19:33,00 --> 01:19:37,50
The tiger moves to it. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS777
01:19:35,00 --> 01:19:43,50
SOMEONE steps onto the port side bench and taps again, relocating the tiger with another piece. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS778
01:19:40,00 --> 01:19:46,50
As he points at the canvas covered section at the bow of the boat, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS779
01:19:43,00 --> 01:19:49,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE sits down on the starboard bench and scowls. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS780
01:19:55,00 --> 01:20:01,50
SOMEONE's ears perk up as he shifts his gaze away from SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS781
01:20:01,00 --> 01:20:08,50
Baring his teeth, the tiger backs away from the bow and SOMEONE lifts the spear. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS782
01:20:08,00 --> 01:20:13,50
SOMEONE charges and the tiger scurries below. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS783
01:20:11,00 --> 01:20:17,50
SOMEONE stares at the draped canvas with wide eyes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS784
01:20:14,00 --> 01:20:22,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE remains underneath and the victorious teen sits back on the bench at the stern. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS785
01:20:19,00 --> 01:20:24,50
He stays alert with the spear in hand. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS786
01:20:24,00 --> 01:20:31,50
SOMEONE gazes with bewildered eyes. His dry, cracked lips rest slightly open. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS787
01:20:29,00 --> 01:20:34,50
Later, he stands on the raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS788
01:20:31,00 --> 01:20:37,50
Building a canvas canopy attached to a wooden cross. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS789
01:20:35,00 --> 01:20:41,50
Rope tied from a crossbar to the raft holds the canopy flat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS790
01:20:38,00 --> 01:20:43,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE watches from the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS791
01:20:40,00 --> 01:20:46,50
SOMEONE lounges underneath in a makeshift net hammock. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS792
01:20:43,00 --> 01:20:49,50
He takes out his survival journal and a pencil. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS793
01:21:10,00 --> 01:21:14,50
Now, he stabs at sharks. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS794
01:21:29,00 --> 01:21:36,50
On the raft, SOMEONE uses two pails as a dholak drum then suddenly stops. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS795
01:21:37,00 --> 01:21:45,50
SOMEONE quickly stands and moves around the raft gazing at a massive school of dolphins. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS796
01:21:42,00 --> 01:21:48,50
They dip in and out of the ocean about 100 feet away. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS797
01:21:45,00 --> 01:21:50,50
A flock of seagulls fly along with them. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS798
01:21:48,00 --> 01:21:54,50
SOMEONE's smiling mouth hangs open as he follows their movement. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS799
01:21:51,00 --> 01:21:58,50
Far behind them, a large ship appears on the horizon. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS800
01:21:56,00 --> 01:22:04,50
SOMEONE waves his arms and stares ahead then quickly moves to the other side of the raft. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS801
01:22:01,00 --> 01:22:07,50
He pulls a flare gun from his survival pack and checks the chamber. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS803
01:22:06,00 --> 01:22:11,50
Facing the ship, he cocks the gun and raises it in the air. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS804
01:22:15,00 --> 01:22:22,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE watches the flare burst in the sky and retreats below the canvas. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS805
01:22:19,00 --> 01:22:23,50
SOMEONE reloads and aims again. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS806
01:22:23,00 --> 01:22:29,50
He glances toward the ship then swiftly grabs another flare. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS807
01:22:28,00 --> 01:22:36,50
Later, the ship resembles a speck on the horizon moving toward the massive setting sun. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS808
01:22:33,00 --> 01:22:40,50
Orange signal smoke wafts from the raft as SOMEONE waves a different type of flare. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS809
01:22:38,00 --> 01:22:44,50
Now only a small pink glow marks the horizon. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS810
01:22:41,00 --> 01:22:47,50
On his raft, SOMEONE gazes out with defeated eyes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS811
01:22:45,00 --> 01:22:51,50
He glances back at SOMEONE SOMEONE who sits calmly on the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS812
01:22:53,00 --> 01:23:00,50
SOMEONE raises the flare gun beside his sullen face and fires upward. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS813
01:22:59,00 --> 01:23:08,50
From a distance, the bright orange flare briefly illuminates the dark night sky and the screen fades to black. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS816
01:23:13,00 --> 01:23:20,50
From directly overhead, we view sharks and large fish swimming just beneath the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS817
01:23:17,00 --> 01:23:22,50
A massive whale shark slowly passes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS819
01:23:35,00 --> 01:23:41,50
At night, reflections of stars glimmer on the black water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS821
01:23:46,00 --> 01:23:52,50
The tiger remains still, keeping his gaze fixed. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS822
01:23:53,00 --> 01:23:58,50
SOMEONE watches the mysterious cat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS823
01:23:59,00 --> 01:24:07,50
SOMEONE's ear twitches and he slowly turns his head looking down into the dark ocean. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS824
01:24:04,00 --> 01:24:10,50
Glancing from the regal beast's profile toward the water, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS825
01:24:07,00 --> 01:24:12,50
SOMEONE climbs to his knees. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS826
01:24:09,00 --> 01:24:15,50
The weakened teen gazes over the side of the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS828
01:24:13,00 --> 01:24:19,50
Behind him, hundreds of stars sparkle across the calm, black sky. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS829
01:24:21,00 --> 01:24:31,50
Beyond his reflection in the water, SOMEONE SOMEONE watches a slim fish swim by with a soft blue glow trailing behind it. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS830
01:24:28,00 --> 01:24:36,50
Several more follow as we move through the tiger's image and below the surface. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS831
01:24:34,00 --> 01:24:41,50
Now dozens of fish cut through the water and a shark swims into the school. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS832
01:24:38,00 --> 01:24:43,50
A large squid emerges from the dark abyss. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS833
01:24:41,00 --> 01:24:47,50
Pumping its tentacles, the squid propels itself farther from our view. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS834
01:24:45,00 --> 01:24:52,50
As a large whale approaches, the squid latches onto its back. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS835
01:24:49,00 --> 01:24:57,50
The whale frantically swims about with the flailing squid squeezing its long tentacles. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS836
01:24:54,00 --> 01:25:01,50
Suddenly, the whale transforms into a jumble of zoo animals. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS837
01:24:58,00 --> 01:25:05,50
As they burst apart, the squid becomes a school of scattering fish. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS838
01:25:02,00 --> 01:25:08,50
A hippo, rhino, giraffe and other animals disperse. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS839
01:25:06,00 --> 01:25:12,50
Mixed in with a sea turtle, manta ray and other sea life. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS840
01:25:09,00 --> 01:25:18,50
A brilliant light zooms and reveals a snaggletooth angler fish with an illuminated antenna. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS841
01:25:15,00 --> 01:25:20,50
Diving deeper into the abyss. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS842
01:25:17,00 --> 01:25:24,50
Tiny particles erupt into vibrant pockets of glowing light. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS843
01:25:21,00 --> 01:25:31,50
We move through a glowing orange trail and dissipating blue particles into an array of teal and purple bubbles. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS844
01:25:29,00 --> 01:25:37,50
A glowing blue lotus flower quickly dissolves and forms into SOMEONE's beautiful mother. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS845
01:25:35,00 --> 01:25:43,50
A pink creature swims before her smiling face as we zoom through her forehead into the blackness. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS846
01:25:41,00 --> 01:25:49,50
Now the Tsimtsum lies on the ocean floor, a blue and teal glow surrounds the sunken ship. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS847
01:25:46,00 --> 01:25:53,50
Our view suddenly backtracks out of the water through SOMEONE's bewildered reflection. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS848
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:58,50
Perched on the bench, SOMEONE SOMEONE watches his dazed shipmate. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS849
01:25:56,00 --> 01:26:02,50
SOMEONE remains in a kneeling position, gazing over the side. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS851
01:26:00,00 --> 01:26:06,50
the boat resembles a white speck on a vast black surface. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS853
01:26:19,00 --> 01:26:25,50
As SOMEONE writes, the lead runs out on his only pencil. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS854
01:26:23,00 --> 01:26:29,50
He lies over the journal and rolls the half inch stub between his fingers. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS855
01:26:28,00 --> 01:26:33,50
Later, a thick cloud brews in the distance. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS856
01:26:31,00 --> 01:26:36,50
Lightning flashes in the darkest section. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS857
01:26:34,00 --> 01:26:39,50
SOMEONE glares at it, then faces SOMEONE SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS858
01:26:39,00 --> 01:26:44,50
The tiger finishes grooming his paw and looks up. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS859
01:26:42,00 --> 01:26:48,50
Now the raft floats on choppy water beside the bow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS860
01:26:46,00 --> 01:26:52,50
SOMEONE unties his canvas canopy and takes down the wooden post. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS861
01:26:50,00 --> 01:26:58,50
Kneeling on the raft, he quickly collects his tools as the agitated surface intensifies beneath him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS862
01:26:56,00 --> 01:27:03,50
With his ears pinned back, SOMEONE SOMEONE takes cover under the canvas. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS863
01:27:00,00 --> 01:27:06,50
SOMEONE secures his tools in the bow and grabs the journal. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS864
01:27:03,00 --> 01:27:10,50
As a large wave sprays over, strong wind whips it away. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS865
01:27:08,00 --> 01:27:14,50
He falls forward and rolls off the canvas into the turbulent water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS866
01:27:15,00 --> 01:27:21,50
SOMEONE watches the journal get sucked into the darkening sky. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS867
01:27:19,00 --> 01:27:25,50
He climbs onto the boat and secures a rope around his torso. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS868
01:27:22,00 --> 01:27:35,50
Rain pounds down as the boat rocks between surging waves. SOMEONE brushes his chin length hair from his face and sees a yellow beam of light protruding through a hole in the storm cloud. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS869
01:27:32,00 --> 01:27:41,50
A massive lightning bolt smacks down beside the boat, spreading a web of brilliant electricity beneath the surface. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS870
01:27:49,00 --> 01:27:56,50
A large wave knocks SOMEONE off the canvas and into the boat. He struggles to his feet. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS871
01:27:56,00 --> 01:28:00,50
He pounds on the canvas. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS872
01:28:05,00 --> 01:28:19,50
He stares into the sky with a huge smile then pulls himself to a crouching position on the bench. Ocean water pours over the frenzied teen as he rips the canvas free of each hook, trying to uncover his friend. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS875
01:28:22,00 --> 01:28:31,50
A massive wave suddenly overtakes the lifeboat. It briefly suspends underwater then shoots through the surface. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS876
01:28:29,00 --> 01:28:37,50
SOMEONE continues unhooking the canvas as the boat ramps off surging waves. He uncovers SOMEONE SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS878
01:28:39,00 --> 01:28:53,50
The tiger flails around in the boat, desperately clawing at the side to keep his head above water. Perched on the bow, SOMEONE gazes at the panicked animal as swirling water covers them both. Lightning fills the sky. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS881
01:29:06,00 --> 01:29:12,50
A wall of water crashes down knocking SOMEONE off the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS882
01:29:10,00 --> 01:29:15,50
His raft floats atop the churning water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS883
01:29:12,00 --> 01:29:19,50
With the rope around his waist, he climbs back up the side and flops onto the bench. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS884
01:29:21,00 --> 01:29:28,50
Shaking his head, SOMEONE blinks rapidly and sees SOMEONE SOMEONE struggling across the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS885
01:29:26,00 --> 01:29:31,50
The tiger manages to secure his front legs on the bench. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS886
01:29:31,00 --> 01:29:38,50
SOMEONE glances behind him and pulls himself up, then crawls to his feet at the bow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS887
01:29:36,00 --> 01:29:45,50
The teen grips the edge and steadies himself. Up ahead, the violent ocean surface pulls the raft farther from the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS888
01:29:43,00 --> 01:29:51,50
SOMEONE gazes longingly after it, then glances back at SOMEONE SOMEONE and grabs the canvas cover. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS889
01:29:48,00 --> 01:29:54,50
He struggles to secure it to the hooks along the bow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS890
01:29:51,00 --> 01:30:01,50
In the distance, a brilliant lightning bolt strikes down followed by flashes of lightning throughout thin pockets in the clouds. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS891
01:29:59,00 --> 01:30:05,50
Now SOMEONE secures the canvas to the final hook and cowers beneath. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS892
01:30:04,00 --> 01:30:10,50
Water rushes along the boat and completely covers him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS893
01:30:07,00 --> 01:30:13,50
As it recedes, he lies on the bench gasping for air. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS894
01:30:13,00 --> 01:30:20,50
The boat rocks the water to the stern and washed SOMEONE SOMEONE off the bench toward SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS897
01:30:21,00 --> 01:30:27,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE lies next to SOMEONE as the water recedes from them both. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS898
01:30:24,00 --> 01:30:32,50
He desperately claws at the bench but the water in the rocking boat sweeps him back to the stern. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS899
01:30:29,00 --> 01:30:37,50
SOMEONE watches the tiger climb onto the bench just as the water rushes back and submerges the teen. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS900
01:30:38,00 --> 01:30:44,50
Now sun shines on SOMEONE's back through a hole in the canvas. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS901
01:30:42,00 --> 01:30:47,50
Water calmly sweeps up over the bench waking him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS902
01:30:45,00 --> 01:30:53,50
He looks across the boat at SOMEONE SOMEONE who sleeps on the bench in a small shaft of sunlight. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS903
01:30:50,00 --> 01:30:56,50
Two feet of ocean water rocks from side to side in the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS905
01:30:55,00 --> 01:31:01,50
Pushing more canvas back, SOMEONE squints as bright sun blankets his face. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS906
01:31:03,00 --> 01:31:08,50
The rolling ocean settles from the storm. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS907
01:31:06,00 --> 01:31:13,50
Sunlight shines on SOMEONE who stands atop the canvas covering the lifeboat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS908
01:31:11,00 --> 01:31:18,50
A short length of rainbow prism light filters from the dark clouds on the horizon. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS910
01:31:18,00 --> 01:31:28,50
Viewed from high overhead, the half covered lifeboat resembles a tiny, two-toned capsule adrift in a sea of black. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS911
01:31:25,00 --> 01:31:33,50
The darkness rapidly lightens to a shimmering and opaque surface with reflected grey clouds. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS913
01:31:32,00 --> 01:31:38,50
By the side of the boat, a few raindrops land in the water causing tiny, circular ripples. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS914
01:31:36,00 --> 01:31:41,50
SOMEONE drinks from a plastic yellow pail. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS915
01:31:39,00 --> 01:31:48,50
He lowers it to reveal dead sunken eyes and untamed black hair forming a nest around his drawn and weary face. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS916
01:31:46,00 --> 01:31:55,50
His blurry gaze shifts into focus revealing SOMEONE SOMEONE, emaciated and lying on the bench with one arm dangling. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS917
01:31:53,00 --> 01:31:59,50
SOMEONE gently steps toward him across the canvas cover. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS918
01:31:56,00 --> 01:32:01,50
Holding the yellow container by his side. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS919
01:31:59,00 --> 01:32:07,50
Using the rim of the boat for support, he steps onto the bench and approaches the resting beast. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS921
01:32:05,00 --> 01:32:11,50
Standing back, he reaches out and tilts the container over SOMEONE's head. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS922
01:32:08,00 --> 01:32:14,50
A thin stream of water lands in the tiger's mouth. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS923
01:32:15,00 --> 01:32:22,50
The cat's lip reflectively curls barely exposing his razor sharp teeth. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS924
01:32:19,00 --> 01:32:24,50
The tiger swallows with a labored breath. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS926
01:32:23,00 --> 01:32:28,50
With saddened eyes, SOMEONE lowers himself toward the resting creature. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS927
01:32:27,00 --> 01:32:34,50
The gaunt voyager's hand trembles as he reaches toward the beast's massive head. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS928
01:32:31,00 --> 01:32:39,50
As he touches the fur of SOMEONE's brow, the cat briefly flinches then lies still. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS929
01:32:37,00 --> 01:32:42,50
The teen's eyes glisten and his lips tremble. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS930
01:32:48,00 --> 01:32:54,50
The tiger weakly looks up at him as SOMEONE strokes its forehead. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS931
01:32:51,00 --> 01:32:57,50
He holds his hand still for a moment then pulls away. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS933
01:32:56,00 --> 01:33:02,50
Holding onto the rim of the boat, SOMEONE takes a seat beside the sickly animal. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS934
01:32:59,00 --> 01:33:06,50
He places the yellow contain aside and slides closer to the tiger. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS935
01:33:05,00 --> 01:33:11,50
SOMEONE lifts his companion's head without resistance, 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS936
01:33:08,00 --> 01:33:13,50
and nestles close to the animal. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS937
01:33:10,00 --> 01:33:16,50
He rests the tigers head on his lap and softly rubs its crown. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS938
01:33:14,00 --> 01:33:18,50
He stares for a moment. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS939
01:33:15,00 --> 01:33:21,50
Then looks up at the sky as despair wells in his eyes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS940
01:33:21,00 --> 01:33:26,50
A teardrop travels down his face and neck. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS941
01:33:34,00 --> 01:33:40,50
Drops of rain land on SOMEONE's sun-blistered face and chest. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS942
01:33:37,00 --> 01:33:42,50
He leans close to the tiger. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS943
01:33:47,00 --> 01:33:52,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE nuzzles his head on SOMEONE's lap. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS944
01:33:53,00 --> 01:33:58,50
The teen rubs the tiger's head. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS945
01:33:58,00 --> 01:34:03,50
The boat drifts on the calm, grey water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS946
01:34:10,00 --> 01:34:14,50
Fade to black. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS947
01:34:13,00 --> 01:34:20,50
Now lying on the sun-dappled canvas, SOMEONE's eyes flutter open. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS948
01:34:17,00 --> 01:34:23,50
A gentle breeze wafts through his bushy black hair. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS949
01:34:20,00 --> 01:34:26,50
He gazes up with barely comprehending eyes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS950
01:34:23,00 --> 01:34:28,50
He glances to the side. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS951
01:34:25,00 --> 01:34:31,50
The lifeboat rests on a green and overgrown shore. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS952
01:34:29,00 --> 01:34:36,50
Only feet from the water's edge, densely packed trees form a lush forest. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS953
01:34:33,00 --> 01:34:39,50
SOMEONE rolls over and props himself up on his week arms. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS954
01:34:37,00 --> 01:34:43,50
He crawls to the bow of the craft and peers down through a hole in the canvas. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS955
01:34:42,00 --> 01:34:47,50
SOMEONE climbs off the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS956
01:34:44,00 --> 01:34:50,50
As he steps on to terraferma, his legs give out and he falls. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS957
01:34:48,00 --> 01:34:55,50
He picks himself up onto his knees and pulls from the boat the grappling tool attached to a rope. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS958
01:34:53,00 --> 01:34:59,50
He anchors the tool firmly around a moss covered root. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS960
01:35:01,00 --> 01:35:08,50
He removes a leafy bit, inspects it, then puts it in his mouth. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS961
01:35:06,00 --> 01:35:12,50
After a few curious bites he looks down. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS962
01:35:09,00 --> 01:35:15,50
Tears up more of the leafy bits and shovels them into his mouth. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS963
01:35:17,00 --> 01:35:26,50
A wider view reveals tall, bushy trees towering over the lifeboat and all along the edge of what appears to be an island. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS964
01:35:23,00 --> 01:35:32,50
SOMEONE tears off a chunk of root and inspects the light pink center within its dark green outer shell. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS965
01:35:29,00 --> 01:35:34,50
He takes a large bite and chews. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS966
01:35:32,00 --> 01:35:37,50
He closes his eyes and eats. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS967
01:35:37,00 --> 01:35:44,50
Now SOMEONE walks through the forest of lanky green growth, similar to banyan trees. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS968
01:35:42,00 --> 01:35:48,50
Branches intertwine over ahead creating shade as he passes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS969
01:35:46,00 --> 01:35:52,50
A layer of densely interlocked roots covers the ground. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS970
01:35:49,00 --> 01:35:56,50
SOMEONE climbs up a small hill using an arched root for support. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS971
01:35:56,00 --> 01:36:01,50
He turns his head and approaches a crest. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS972
01:36:03,00 --> 01:36:11,50
He looks out over a vast area where the ground seems to ungulate around several circular pools. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS973
01:36:08,00 --> 01:36:16,50
Thousands of meerkats stand up straight with their tawny fur covered chests pumped out. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS974
01:36:13,00 --> 01:36:21,50
Their whiskered snouts quiver as their darkly inset eyes peer in SOMEONE's directly. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS975
01:36:18,00 --> 01:36:24,50
Now SOMEONE walks among the knee-high mammals, waving his hand at them. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS976
01:36:23,00 --> 01:36:27,50
They scatter among bones on the ground. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS977
01:36:28,00 --> 01:36:36,50
SOMEONE approaches a glistening pond surround by a three foot tall bank of roots. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS978
01:36:33,00 --> 01:36:40,50
Meerkats run around him as he sits at the edge, reaching one foot down. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS979
01:36:37,00 --> 01:36:43,50
He tests the water with his toes then drops in. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS980
01:36:41,00 --> 01:36:46,50
He raises his head from the pond and looks around. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS982
01:36:45,00 --> 01:36:51,50
Swimming forward, he opens his mouth wide and fills it with water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS983
01:36:48,00 --> 01:36:54,50
SOMEONE tilts his head back and takes a big gulp. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS984
01:36:51,00 --> 01:36:57,50
He smiles as he looks at the surrounding mass of water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS985
01:37:00,00 --> 01:37:10,50
Viewed from overhead, meerkats surround the deep blue, almost-perfectly round pool with green roots fringing its perimeter. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS986
01:37:08,00 --> 01:37:15,50
SOMEONE swims to the center, the rolls over and backstrokes beneath the sun. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS987
01:37:12,00 --> 01:37:17,50
He swims to the edge of the pond. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS988
01:37:16,00 --> 01:37:22,50
Now he rests against the root wall and splashes water on his face. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS989
01:37:20,00 --> 01:37:27,50
Later he climbs out of the pond and notices the meerkats staring behind him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS990
01:37:25,00 --> 01:37:32,50
He turns to see SOMEONE SOMEONE walking through the field of attentive little creatures. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS991
01:37:29,00 --> 01:37:36,50
The tiger grabs a meerkat in his teeth and swings its lifeless body. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS992
01:37:35,00 --> 01:37:43,50
SOMEONE presses his lips together with a resigned smile as SOMEONE SOMEONE lies down and eats his meal. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS994
01:37:45,00 --> 01:37:50,50
SOMEONE treks through the forest on his own. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS995
01:37:51,00 --> 01:37:59,50
Looking down, he stops and unties SOMEONE's string bracelet, unwrapping it from his wrist. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS996
01:37:56,00 --> 01:38:02,50
He crouches down and ties it around a thick root. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS997
01:38:01,00 --> 01:38:08,50
Later, a beam of light dissipates over the ocean as the sun lowers into the horizon. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS998
01:38:06,00 --> 01:38:11,50
Soft, red light ripples over the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1000
01:38:11,00 --> 01:38:17,50
SOMEONE ties a net between branches the width of his torso. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1001
01:38:16,00 --> 01:38:24,50
He looks out over the field as thousands of meerkats stampede into the forest. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1003
01:38:25,00 --> 01:38:34,50
The creatures climb into the trees. SOMEONE turns his head and sees SOMEONE SOMEONE springing toward the lifeboat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1004
01:38:37,00 --> 01:38:44,50
The meerkats scatter up the branches around SOMEONE. A few crawl into his net. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1005
01:38:44,00 --> 01:38:48,50
He pushes them away. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1006
01:38:46,00 --> 01:38:52,50
More surround him as he attempts to lie in the makeshift hammock. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1007
01:38:54,00 --> 01:39:00,50
He smiles as a few of them jump on top of him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1008
01:38:57,00 --> 01:39:04,50
At night, a meerkat yawns with his hind legs hanging over a branch. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1009
01:39:01,00 --> 01:39:08,50
Its head slumps over and it falls toward another sleeping meerkat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1010
01:39:05,00 --> 01:39:10,50
A group of them lie across the branch. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1011
01:39:08,00 --> 01:39:13,50
A smaller one nuzzles noses with a tiny meerkat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1012
01:39:10,00 --> 01:39:15,50
Then cuddles up with a larger one. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1014
01:39:14,00 --> 01:39:18,50
SOMEONE rolls over in his hammock. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1015
01:39:15,00 --> 01:39:22,50
A rippling blue and green light glows onto the bottom of the branch. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1016
01:39:22,00 --> 01:39:29,50
A meerkat climbs onto SOMEONE's back and rests across his shoulder. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1017
01:39:26,00 --> 01:39:32,50
SOMEONE's eyes open up and he peeks over the branch. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1018
01:39:32,00 --> 01:39:38,50
He stands up and holds a branch for support. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1019
01:39:35,00 --> 01:39:43,50
With his mouth ajar, he stares down at a pool emitting a phosphorescent blue/green light. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1020
01:39:41,00 --> 01:39:49,50
The body of a large, dead fish surfaces and floats atop the water beside dozens of smaller dead fish. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1021
01:39:51,00 --> 01:39:58,50
The soft light glows on SOMEONE's face as he looks down open mouthed. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1022
01:40:01,00 --> 01:40:07,50
More fish die and float to the surface of the gurgling pool. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1023
01:40:06,00 --> 01:40:11,50
SOMEONE's fearful gaze looks up. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1024
01:40:08,00 --> 01:40:14,50
He trembles as a breeze brushes over the island's trees. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1025
01:40:11,00 --> 01:40:17,50
A glowing light shimmers around the lifeboat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1026
01:40:14,00 --> 01:40:21,50
SOMEONE SOMEONE sits up and stares inland as the boat lightly bobs on the water. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1027
01:40:19,00 --> 01:40:25,50
Beneath him, the same eerie light surrounds the lifeboat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1028
01:40:24,00 --> 01:40:31,50
From a distance, the island shows contours like that of the human body lying on its back. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1029
01:40:29,00 --> 01:40:36,50
A teal light glows beneath, surrounding the entire island. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1030
01:40:35,00 --> 01:40:41,50
Now SOMEONE rips a spherical object from a glowing branch. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1031
01:40:38,00 --> 01:40:44,50
His eyes fixate on it as he spins it between his hands. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1032
01:40:42,00 --> 01:40:47,50
Overlapping leaves surround the orb. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1033
01:40:45,00 --> 01:40:53,50
As he peels back the layers, the inner part of the leaves glow along their veins. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1035
01:40:52,00 --> 01:40:58,50
The leaves separate to reveal a black and yellow tooth. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1036
01:40:57,00 --> 01:41:02,50
His eyes fix on the weathered tooth. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1037
01:40:59,00 --> 01:41:04,50
Light reflects off his glistening face. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1038
01:41:04,00 --> 01:41:09,50
Now at SOMEONE's house. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1039
01:42:21,00 --> 01:42:28,50
At sunset, SOMEONE kneels on the lifeboats canvas cover and ties up bundles of roots. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1040
01:42:38,00 --> 01:42:43,50
SOMEONE hops off the boat looking inland. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1041
01:42:49,00 --> 01:42:54,50
He blows the whistle and stares up a hill. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1042
01:42:57,00 --> 01:43:04,50
With his mouth open, SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE SOMEONE hurries down the hill toward him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1043
01:43:03,00 --> 01:43:09,50
He un-anchors the hook from the root and waits for the tiger to hop on board. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1044
01:43:42,00 --> 01:43:46,50
The boat floats into the distance. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1045
01:43:44,00 --> 01:43:52,50
Later, SOMEONE tumbles off the side and grabs onto a rope connected to the bow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1046
01:43:49,00 --> 01:43:56,50
Underwater, his feet graze the sand as he pulls the boat to shore. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1047
01:44:09,00 --> 01:44:13,50
SOMEONE struggles with the boat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1048
01:44:11,00 --> 01:44:17,50
Beyond the shore line, a jungle looms in the distance. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1049
01:44:14,00 --> 01:44:20,50
SOMEONE collapses onto the sand as the boat sways with the waves. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1050
01:44:33,00 --> 01:44:40,50
Later, SOMEONE lies prone on the beach, his arms out stretched from his sides. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1051
01:44:41,00 --> 01:44:47,50
SOMEONE looks up as SOMEONE SOMEONE hops over him from the lifeboat. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1052
01:44:44,00 --> 01:44:49,50
The tide washes over the tiger's claws. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1053
01:44:50,00 --> 01:44:55,50
The scrawny tiger stretches and yawns. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1054
01:44:56,00 --> 01:45:01,50
The tiger awkwardly ambles across the sand. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1055
01:45:13,00 --> 01:45:18,50
Sand covers SOMEONE's face as he peers at the beast. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1056
01:45:20,00 --> 01:45:24,50
Now at adult SOMEONE's house. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1057
01:45:27,00 --> 01:45:32,50
He takes a long breath and blinks. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1058
01:45:33,00 --> 01:45:39,50
On the beach, SOMEONE struggles to keep his head up but collapses. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1059
01:45:37,00 --> 01:45:43,50
Later, a group of men jog toward him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1060
01:46:03,00 --> 01:46:07,50
He stares into the jungle. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1061
01:46:06,00 --> 01:46:10,50
Mouth agape. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1062
01:46:07,00 --> 01:46:12,50
He stares and cries as they carry him away. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1063
01:46:10,00 --> 01:46:15,50
At his house, adult SOMEONE's eyes glisten. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1064
01:46:34,00 --> 01:46:40,50
With his mouth open, the story teller stares at his guest. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1065
01:46:38,00 --> 01:46:42,50
The writer lowers his gaze. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1066
01:47:05,00 --> 01:47:09,50
He wipes his nose. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1067
01:47:23,00 --> 01:47:28,50
A tear spills from his eye. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1068
01:47:27,00 --> 01:47:32,50
His lips twitch and he looks down. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1069
01:47:30,00 --> 01:47:35,50
The writer blinks at him then briefly glances away. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1070
01:47:36,00 --> 01:47:42,50
He watches SOMEONE wipe the tears from his cheeks. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1071
01:47:46,00 --> 01:47:52,50
The writer lightly tilts his head and shifts his eyes. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1072
01:48:12,00 --> 01:48:17,50
SOMEONE looks off then turns. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1073
01:48:16,00 --> 01:48:21,50
He stands and approaches a cabinet. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1074
01:48:27,00 --> 01:48:32,50
The writer takes the report. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1075
01:48:29,00 --> 01:48:33,50
Now at the hospital. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1078
01:48:51,00 --> 01:48:55,50
They stare at SOMEONE. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1079
01:49:12,00 --> 01:49:18,50
The younger Japanese man stares at SOMEONE as the older one turns to him. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1081
01:49:19,00 --> 01:49:24,50
The older man flips the tape in his recorder. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1082
01:49:54,00 --> 01:49:59,50
They sit at the foot of SOMEONE's hospital bed. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1083
01:50:09,00 --> 01:50:14,50
The older man nods and raises his eyebrows. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1084
01:50:11,00 --> 01:50:16,50
SOMEONE swallows and looks off. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1085
01:50:20,00 --> 01:50:26,50
The older SOMEONE leans back with his arms folded and gazes off. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1086
01:50:38,00 --> 01:50:42,50
The teen survivor frowns. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1087
01:50:54,00 --> 01:50:59,50
SOMEONE gives a conceding nod. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1088
01:51:59,00 --> 01:52:04,50
SOMEONE allows a fawned, wistful smile. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1089
01:52:02,00 --> 01:52:07,50
It fades and he takes on a haunted expression. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1090
01:52:45,00 --> 01:52:50,50
SOMEONE lowers his eyes and shakes his head. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1091
01:52:53,00 --> 01:52:57,50
He bites his lower lip. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1092
01:52:58,00 --> 01:53:03,50
The younger insurance rep solemnly faces his partner. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1093
01:53:03,00 --> 01:53:09,50
The older man shifts his grim, compassionate gaze. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1094
01:53:36,00 --> 01:53:41,50
SOMEONE faces the older man earnestly then looks away. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1095
01:53:45,00 --> 01:53:54,50
As the young survivor hangs his head, the older insurance investigator faces his partner with a softened gaze. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1096
01:53:55,00 --> 01:54:01,50
He looks back at the teen and his brow knits uneasily. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1097
01:54:06,00 --> 01:54:11,50
The orphan's eyes fill with tears. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1098
01:54:19,00 --> 01:54:24,50
SOMEONE's mouth twists willfully and his nostrils flare. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1099
01:54:25,00 --> 01:54:29,50
He stares off mournfully. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1100
01:54:27,00 --> 01:54:33,50
His expression hardens and SOMEONE turns his earnest gaze on the older man. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1101
01:54:32,00 --> 01:54:37,50
Tears stream down his cheek. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1102
01:54:45,00 --> 01:54:52,50
Facing the young investigator, SOMEONE sniffles and shakes his head. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1103
01:55:00,00 --> 01:55:05,50
SOMEONE's parted lips show a chipped front tooth. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1104
01:55:03,00 --> 01:55:09,50
He stares off with a haunted expression and takes a deep breath. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1105
01:55:16,00 --> 01:55:23,50
At SOMEONE's house, the young writer stares off with parted lips and a furrowed brow. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1106
01:55:34,00 --> 01:55:40,50
The middle aged SOMEONE faces his guest with a careworn gaze. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1107
01:55:39,00 --> 01:55:43,50
The writer gives a slight frown. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1108
01:56:10,00 --> 01:56:16,50
The writer gazes at the mild mannered older man. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1109
01:56:16,00 --> 01:56:20,50
The young man nods. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1110
01:56:45,00 --> 01:56:51,50
SOMEONE regards the younger man with a calm, sad expression. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1111
01:56:49,00 --> 01:56:54,50
The writer shifts his gaze thoughtfully. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1112
01:56:57,00 --> 01:57:03,50
His deep set eyes glistening. SOMEONE gives a faint smile. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1113
01:57:08,00 --> 01:57:13,50
SOMEONE's smile grows. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1114
01:57:10,00 --> 01:57:16,50
The writers eyes sparkle and the corners of his lips turn up. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1115
01:57:14,00 --> 01:57:20,50
He lowers his eyes, tries to bite back his smile and fails. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1116
01:57:30,00 --> 01:57:35,50
The two men share a warm smile. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1117
01:57:33,00 --> 01:57:38,50
SOMEONE's eyes dart toward a window. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1118
01:57:51,00 --> 01:57:55,50
SOMEONE crosses toward the door. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1119
01:57:53,00 --> 01:58:01,50
Seated on a couch, the young writer glances after him then opens the insurance file. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1120
01:57:58,00 --> 01:58:05,50
It contains a news clipping featuring SOMEONE at the end of his journey. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1121
01:58:02,00 --> 01:58:07,50
Along with a document with a Japanese seal. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1122
01:58:06,00 --> 01:58:11,50
The writer flips to the last page. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1123
01:58:26,00 --> 01:58:32,50
The writer looks up from the file and beams. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1124
01:58:40,00 --> 01:58:46,50
The writer shakes hands with SOMEONE's beautiful wife and children. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1125
01:58:43,00 --> 01:58:50,50
Now the teenage SOMEONE floats on the ocean gazing toward us. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1126
01:58:47,00 --> 01:58:54,50
As he smiles, the tiger appears to his left facing away from us. The boy fades from view and the sparkling ocean becomes the Mexican jungle. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1127
01:58:52,00 --> 01:58:59,50
The powerful animal ventures into the lush forest. 

LIFE_OF_PI_DVS1128
01:58:57,00 --> 01:59:02,50
He vanishes within the thick, jungle growth.
