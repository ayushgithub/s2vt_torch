MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS23
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:53,50
A blizzard sweeps across the boy's disappointed gaze. Daytime. In Manhattan, a business man talks on his cell phone. 30 years later. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS24
00:03:06,00 --> 00:03:11,50
SOMEONE smells the bound contract. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS25
00:03:15,00 --> 00:03:20,50
Inside, SOMEONE faces a secretary. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS27
00:03:35,00 --> 00:03:40,50
SOMEONE hands him the contract. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS28
00:03:53,00 --> 00:03:57,50
SOMEONE points to a model ship. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS29
00:04:25,00 --> 00:04:30,50
SOMEONE rocks SOMEONE's chair. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS30
00:04:28,00 --> 00:04:32,50
He nods to SOMEONE who turns on a fan. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS31
00:04:31,00 --> 00:04:37,50
He sprinkles SOMEONE with water from a pitcher. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS32
00:04:37,00 --> 00:04:42,50
SOMEONE tosses scraps of newspaper. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS33
00:04:45,00 --> 00:04:50,50
SOMEONE spins his client's chair. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS34
00:04:59,00 --> 00:05:04,50
SOMEONE cocks an eyebrow at his assistant. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS35
00:05:11,00 --> 00:05:16,50
He looks at SOMEONE who hands him a newspaper hat. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS36
00:05:18,00 --> 00:05:23,50
He places the hat on his client's bald head. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS37
00:05:23,00 --> 00:05:28,50
SOMEONE shuts his eyes, and shakes his head. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS38
00:05:25,00 --> 00:05:29,50
SOMEONE pats him on the shoulder. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS39
00:05:27,00 --> 00:05:33,50
As he and his assistant head out, SOMEONE swivels his chair to face them. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS40
00:05:32,00 --> 00:05:37,50
SOMEONE turns back with a smile. Now in a boardroom. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS41
00:05:58,00 --> 00:06:04,50
He unveils a marble slab etched with Franklin, Popper, Reader and Yates. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS42
00:06:23,00 --> 00:06:27,50
He grabs a chair. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS43
00:07:17,00 --> 00:07:22,50
On a residential street. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS44
00:07:26,00 --> 00:07:31,50
SOMEONE leaves his Town Car for a brownstone. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS45
00:07:36,00 --> 00:07:41,50
SOMEONE wraps his arms around him. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS46
00:07:44,00 --> 00:07:49,50
The bearded man holds him in a long, unblinking gaze. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS47
00:07:50,00 --> 00:07:55,50
SOMEONE enters the house to find a boy dribbling a soccer ball. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS48
00:07:58,00 --> 00:08:05,50
The boy kicks the ball into his groin and he collapses on the floor. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS49
00:08:07,00 --> 00:08:11,50
He peeks in the refrigerator. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS50
00:08:28,00 --> 00:08:32,50
The boy joins them. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS51
00:08:33,00 --> 00:08:38,50
A confused SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS52
00:08:37,00 --> 00:08:41,50
A teenager comes downstairs. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS53
00:08:45,00 --> 00:08:50,50
The teen plops on a couch with her cell phone. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS54
00:08:53,00 --> 00:08:58,50
SOMEONE and his son eye the girl. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS55
00:09:04,00 --> 00:09:08,50
They swap a look. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS56
00:09:08,00 --> 00:09:14,50
SOMEONE ambles into the living room and stuffs his hands in his pockets. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS57
00:09:17,00 --> 00:09:22,50
He sits beside his daughter who rolls her eyes. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS58
00:09:24,00 --> 00:09:30,50
SOMEONE glances aside and subtly shakes his head. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS59
00:09:40,00 --> 00:09:43,50
SOMEONE gets up. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS60
00:09:48,00 --> 00:09:52,50
She storms out. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS61
00:09:57,00 --> 00:10:01,50
SOMEONE stuffs his hands in his pockets. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS62
00:09:59,00 --> 00:10:03,50
Now the Town Car parks. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS63
00:10:09,00 --> 00:10:13,50
A doorman greets him. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS64
00:10:20,00 --> 00:10:26,50
Later, SOMEONE enters his spacious two-floor apartment. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS65
00:10:23,00 --> 00:10:30,50
Glancing over the sleek black furnishings, he sets gift bags on a table. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS66
00:10:28,00 --> 00:10:33,50
He takes off his sunglasses, then adjusts the dining room chair. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS67
00:10:31,00 --> 00:10:36,50
He leans his hands on the table. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS68
00:10:36,00 --> 00:10:41,50
SOMEONE looks around the immaculate living room. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS69
00:10:40,00 --> 00:10:44,50
He takes out a cell phone. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS70
00:10:49,00 --> 00:10:53,50
In an office, 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS71
00:11:04,00 --> 00:11:09,50
SOMEONE sits and crosses his legs. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS72
00:11:36,00 --> 00:11:40,50
SOMEONE stares off. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS73
00:11:38,00 --> 00:11:44,50
Now the city's buildings stand against a muted dawn sky. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS74
00:11:41,00 --> 00:11:47,50
An alarm clock reads, 6:30 AM. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS75
00:11:44,00 --> 00:11:49,50
SOMEONE shuts it off and sits up on the side of his bed. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS76
00:11:51,00 --> 00:11:59,50
Now fully dressed, SOMEONE opens his front door and finds a wooden crate waiting for him in a hallway. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS77
00:12:04,00 --> 00:12:10,50
He removes the top and finds a frozen penguin inside. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS78
00:12:13,00 --> 00:12:20,50
He removes the SOMEONE penguin from the crate and smirks as he sets it down on an end table. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS79
00:12:23,00 --> 00:12:29,50
As SOMEONE turns, the penguin blinks and stretches its neck. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS80
00:12:31,00 --> 00:12:35,50
It lifts its flippers. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS81
00:12:34,00 --> 00:12:39,50
It shakes off ice chips from head to toe. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS82
00:12:43,00 --> 00:12:47,50
He turns around. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS83
00:12:45,00 --> 00:12:49,50
The penguin's gone. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS84
00:12:48,00 --> 00:12:59,50
He abruptly stands upright with his eyes wide, and his mouth slightly agape, then slowly turns to find the knee-high, black and white bird standing behind him. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS85
00:12:59,00 --> 00:13:04,50
He raises his cell phone. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS86
00:13:02,00 --> 00:13:08,50
Facing the penguin, he puts his cell phone back in his pocket. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS87
00:13:14,00 --> 00:13:21,50
Eyeing the penguin he cautiously crouches down and pokes its white chest. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS88
00:13:20,00 --> 00:13:25,50
The penguin glances around. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS89
00:13:23,00 --> 00:13:29,50
SOMEONE leans in, reaching out to the flightless bird. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS90
00:13:29,00 --> 00:13:34,50
He carefully grabs the penguin by the waist and picks it up. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS91
00:13:34,00 --> 00:13:39,50
SOMEONE stands upright, gazing at it. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS92
00:13:41,00 --> 00:13:51,50
White bird droppings land on his black leather shoe. He sours and carries the penguin away. Later, SOMEONE dumps ice into a bathtub. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS93
00:13:51,00 --> 00:13:55,50
He pats the tub. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS94
00:14:01,00 --> 00:14:05,50
In the living room. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS95
00:14:06,00 --> 00:14:14,50
SOMEONE walks into the crate, breaking it apart and sending an envelope sliding under a dresser. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS96
00:14:12,00 --> 00:14:16,50
He rubs his shins. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS97
00:14:14,00 --> 00:14:19,50
He grabs his briefcase and leaves. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS98
00:14:17,00 --> 00:14:22,50
Our view presses in on the envelope. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS99
00:14:19,00 --> 00:14:29,50
Now in Central Park, SOMEONE jogs to the Tavern on The Green, a quaint brick restaurant. Inside, SOMEONE paces. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS100
00:14:38,00 --> 00:14:42,50
SOMEONE's eyes widen. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS101
00:14:47,00 --> 00:14:55,50
He offers his hand for a shake, but the wealthy old woman holds hers out for a kiss. SOMEONE gives it a quick peck. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS102
00:15:00,00 --> 00:15:07,50
In a dining room with crystal chandeliers, she leads him past four staff members. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS103
00:15:21,00 --> 00:15:26,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE eye him flatly. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS104
00:15:29,00 --> 00:15:34,50
She leads him to a corner table. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS105
00:15:40,00 --> 00:15:48,50
At the apartment, the penguin pecks at the tub, then tries to hop on a ledge and accidentally turns on a faucet. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS106
00:15:45,00 --> 00:15:50,50
It dunks its head under the running water. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS107
00:15:49,00 --> 00:15:54,50
At Tavern on The Green. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS108
00:16:41,00 --> 00:16:46,50
He gazes at the corner table. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS109
00:17:41,00 --> 00:17:47,50
Mrs. SOMEONE leaves. SOMEONE stands and SOMEONE joins him. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS110
00:17:49,00 --> 00:17:56,50
Meanwhile in SOMEONE's bathroom water trickles over the edge of the tub and onto the floor. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS111
00:17:53,00 --> 00:18:01,50
As more flows from the faucet, the penguin swims and dives in the overflowing bath. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS112
00:17:58,00 --> 00:18:04,50
Later, SOMEONE arrives at home and makes a call. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS113
00:18:29,00 --> 00:18:33,50
He heads upstairs. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS114
00:18:41,00 --> 00:18:47,50
Behind the bathrooms glass paneled door, the penguin swims by. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS115
00:19:07,00 --> 00:19:12,50
He reaches for the bathroom door. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS116
00:19:11,00 --> 00:19:17,50
As he opens it, water gushes out, knocking SOMEONE down. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS117
00:19:14,00 --> 00:19:20,50
Engulfing him, it washes over the staircase landing, to the floor below. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS118
00:19:18,00 --> 00:19:25,50
SOMEONE's fingers clutch the landing's edge as he dangles over his dining area. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS119
00:19:22,00 --> 00:19:26,50
The penguin approaches. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS120
00:19:29,00 --> 00:19:34,50
The bird poises its rear above SOMEONE's face. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS121
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:40,50
As it releases a stream of white droppings, SOMEONE lets go of the landing. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS122
00:19:38,00 --> 00:19:42,50
Later he makes a call. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS123
00:19:46,00 --> 00:19:53,50
He drops his phone into a blender. Sparks flash as he turns it on. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS124
00:19:51,00 --> 00:19:55,50
Now he answers his door. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS125
00:19:56,00 --> 00:20:01,50
The penguin appears behind him. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS126
00:20:14,00 --> 00:20:18,50
Another official. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS127
00:20:23,00 --> 00:20:28,50
The sanitation man leaves. Nighttime. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS128
00:20:25,00 --> 00:20:34,50
SOMEONE lies on his couch with a laptop and navigates a website called, The Penguin Recipe Page. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS129
00:20:31,00 --> 00:20:36,50
He notices his own penguin watching him. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS130
00:20:35,00 --> 00:20:42,50
As the bird tilts his head curiously, SOMEONE minimizes the recipe window. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS132
00:20:40,00 --> 00:20:45,50
SOMEONE sleeps with the closed computer still on his lap. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS133
00:20:43,00 --> 00:20:48,50
His limp hand slides off the couch's edge. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS134
00:20:45,00 --> 00:20:50,50
The penguin waddles to his side. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS135
00:20:49,00 --> 00:20:55,50
Leaning closer, it eyes the weary man. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS137
00:20:53,00 --> 00:21:00,50
As SOMEONE sleeps soundly, his penguin watches with its beak mere inches from his face. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS138
00:21:00,00 --> 00:21:07,50
Waking up, SOMEONE finds himself staring straight into the birds open beak. Later. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS139
00:21:05,00 --> 00:21:10,50
He ushers it into the hall. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS140
00:21:13,00 --> 00:21:17,50
He points. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS141
00:21:19,00 --> 00:21:23,50
The penguin stares at him. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS142
00:21:20,00 --> 00:21:26,50
SOMEONE notices a vase of flowers sitting on a table in the hallway. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS143
00:21:29,00 --> 00:21:34,50
He pours the vase's water down the hall. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS144
00:21:32,00 --> 00:21:37,50
He grabs the bird. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS145
00:21:34,00 --> 00:21:39,50
He tosses it onto the path of water. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS146
00:21:38,00 --> 00:21:43,50
The penguin slides away on its belly. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS147
00:21:42,00 --> 00:21:47,50
Later, SOMEONE passes the building's front desk. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS148
00:21:49,00 --> 00:21:53,50
He holds it up. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS149
00:21:56,00 --> 00:22:03,50
SOMEONE sets the penguin on the floor, then turns to a computer. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS150
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:06,50
He pulls up security footage of SOMEONE tossing the penguin down the hallway. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS151
00:22:09,00 --> 00:22:15,50
He shows a closer image of SOMEONE cheering and freezes it. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS152
00:22:15,00 --> 00:22:19,50
SOMEONE hands it over. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS153
00:22:23,00 --> 00:22:28,50
SOMEONE offers a SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS154
00:22:27,00 --> 00:22:32,50
SOMEONE looks at the bird standing behind him. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS155
00:22:31,00 --> 00:22:36,50
SOMEONE hands him more cash. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS156
00:22:34,00 --> 00:22:38,50
He doles out even more. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS157
00:22:39,00 --> 00:22:43,50
SOMEONE feels SOMEONE's face. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS158
00:22:44,00 --> 00:22:49,50
SOMEONE returns to his apartment. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS159
00:22:56,00 --> 00:23:00,50
A neighbor emerges. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS160
00:23:17,00 --> 00:23:22,50
SOMEONE's smile fades and his eyes shift. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS161
00:23:29,00 --> 00:23:33,50
He backs through his doorway. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS162
00:23:31,00 --> 00:23:36,50
Later, on a nature program, 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS163
00:23:36,00 --> 00:23:44,50
as SOMEONE ties a ribbon on a gift box, his penguin steps closer to the television. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS164
00:23:41,00 --> 00:23:48,50
It examines its flippers, then flaps them as it watches a soaring eagle on the nature show. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS165
00:23:49,00 --> 00:23:54,50
He picks up the TV remote. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS166
00:23:53,00 --> 00:24:02,50
He changes the channel to a news program called, The Squawk Box. The penguin waddles over and unties the gift's ribbon. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS168
00:24:05,00 --> 00:24:10,50
Opening the door, SOMEONE finds a wooden crate. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS169
00:24:13,00 --> 00:24:19,50
With its flippers extended behind it, the penguin hurries over. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS170
00:24:16,00 --> 00:24:21,50
SOMEONE removes a panel on the crate. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS171
00:24:27,00 --> 00:24:32,50
The penguin runs off and SOMEONE gives chase. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS172
00:24:30,00 --> 00:24:34,50
Two penguins exit the crate. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS173
00:24:34,00 --> 00:24:39,50
He places his penguin in the crate. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS174
00:24:36,00 --> 00:24:41,50
As he turns away, two of them run out. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS175
00:24:41,00 --> 00:24:46,50
Two more escape unseen. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS176
00:24:51,00 --> 00:25:00,50
With a confused look, SOMEONE sets his penguin down and heads into the kitchen. He finds a penguin eating from a tipped trashcan. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS177
00:25:02,00 --> 00:25:07,50
In the bathroom, he finds a penguin in the toilet. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS178
00:25:08,00 --> 00:25:14,50
The bird spins with the flushing water. SOMEONE grabs it. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS179
00:25:12,00 --> 00:25:17,50
Covering his ears he drops the penguin. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS180
00:25:14,00 --> 00:25:22,50
His gaze shifts to the dining area. As he heads over, the bathroom penguin follows. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS181
00:25:21,00 --> 00:25:30,50
SOMEONE jumps in surprise. In the dining area he finds three more birds. A fourth slides down the stairs. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS182
00:25:28,00 --> 00:25:34,50
He finds a fifth atop a panel fountain. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS183
00:25:40,00 --> 00:25:45,50
He opens a tin of sardines. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS184
00:25:43,00 --> 00:25:49,50
The penguins charge at him. Now he answers the door. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS185
00:26:10,00 --> 00:26:15,50
A penguin appears at his feet. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS186
00:26:24,00 --> 00:26:28,50
The other penguins run over. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS187
00:26:34,00 --> 00:26:39,50
He points at his original penguin. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS188
00:26:40,00 --> 00:26:44,50
A second bird approaches. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS189
00:26:44,00 --> 00:26:49,50
A third nips at SOMEONE's leg. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS190
00:26:50,00 --> 00:26:54,50
A fourth lifts its rear. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS191
00:26:54,00 --> 00:26:59,50
A fifth nestles SOMEONE's leg. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS192
00:27:02,00 --> 00:27:10,50
They see the sixth bird running into a wall. It stumbles back, then does it two more times. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS193
00:27:35,00 --> 00:27:39,50
SOMEONE's eyes widen. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS194
00:27:51,00 --> 00:27:55,50
She touches his arm. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS195
00:27:54,00 --> 00:27:58,50
She nods skeptically. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS196
00:28:03,00 --> 00:28:10,50
SOMEONE chases a penguin out of the room. His sister and the other birds follow. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS197
00:28:13,00 --> 00:28:16,50
In the kitchen, 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS198
00:28:14,00 --> 00:28:20,50
two penguins nuzzle in a refrigerator drawer. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS199
00:28:25,00 --> 00:28:29,50
SOMEONE cracks open the door. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS200
00:28:37,00 --> 00:28:41,50
He spots one. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS201
00:28:51,00 --> 00:28:56,50
He points at the cake, then backs into the hall. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS202
00:29:29,00 --> 00:29:35,50
As SOMEONE heads back inside, SOMEONE makes a call. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS203
00:29:39,00 --> 00:29:43,50
In the apartment, 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS204
00:30:15,00 --> 00:30:25,50
as SOMEONE hugs his father, the penguins gather at SOMEONE's legs. Joining them, Nimrod trips. Later, a cab pulls up outside. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS205
00:30:30,00 --> 00:30:34,50
To SOMEONE 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS206
00:30:32,00 --> 00:30:36,50
She hits him playfully. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS207
00:30:37,00 --> 00:30:43,50
SOMEONE hugs him, then climbs into the cab. His mother smiles at her ex. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS208
00:30:43,00 --> 00:30:49,50
She enters the cab and it drives off. SOMEONE grins at a passing man. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS210
00:30:53,00 --> 00:30:59,50
SOMEONE lies awake in bed, his eyes wide. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS211
00:31:06,00 --> 00:31:11,50
Downstairs the penguins run in circles. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS212
00:31:10,00 --> 00:31:15,50
They see SOMEONE on the staircase landing. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS213
00:31:17,00 --> 00:31:22,50
He glares, then starts to walk away. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS214
00:31:21,00 --> 00:31:25,50
He gives a crazed look. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS216
00:31:24,00 --> 00:31:31,50
SOMEONE slaps off his alarm, then frowns at a sleeping penguin with its head against his arm. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS217
00:31:29,00 --> 00:31:34,50
He finds all of the birds in his bed. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS218
00:31:31,00 --> 00:31:40,50
As Stinky's tail feathers rise and fall on Nimrod's face, the bird tries to shake them away, but rolls off the bed. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS219
00:31:38,00 --> 00:31:43,50
Now in the kitchen, SOMEONE makes espresso. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS220
00:31:40,00 --> 00:31:45,50
The penguins crowd him. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS221
00:31:50,00 --> 00:31:58,50
As he stows a wine bottle, Bitey nips him. He spills his espresso. A penguin pecks at a remote. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS222
00:31:58,00 --> 00:32:04,50
The bird hits buttons with its beak, and the TV turns on. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS223
00:32:01,00 --> 00:32:09,50
As the penguins move closer, SOMEONE follows and sees SOMEONE SOMEONE walking like a penguin. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS224
00:32:08,00 --> 00:32:13,50
One penguin waddles, then turns imitating SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS225
00:32:15,00 --> 00:32:19,50
He gives a thoughtful look. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS226
00:32:17,00 --> 00:32:25,50
Now wearing his suit and jacket, the passes the living room and finds the penguins still mesmerized by SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS227
00:32:27,00 --> 00:32:33,50
He leaves. Now at work, he and SOMEONE hurry up a staircase. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS228
00:32:47,00 --> 00:32:51,50
SOMEONE hands him an invite. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS229
00:33:06,00 --> 00:33:10,50
He grins. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS230
00:33:17,00 --> 00:33:21,50
His bosses leave. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS231
00:33:28,00 --> 00:33:32,50
She reads. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS232
00:33:42,00 --> 00:33:46,50
He reads from the printout. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS233
00:33:55,00 --> 00:34:00,50
At home, SOMEONE keeps his balcony doors open. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS234
00:34:03,00 --> 00:34:10,50
He wears his coat as he feeds the penguins. His kids arrive. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS235
00:34:30,00 --> 00:34:39,50
Now at the park, SOMEONE kicks a soccer ball while SOMEONE sits with SOMEONE on a bench. The penguins crowd him. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS236
00:34:44,00 --> 00:34:53,50
As he waves, the penguins take a step back. Beside him, SOMEONE texts on her cell and SOMEONE gives a disappointed look. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS237
00:34:50,00 --> 00:34:55,50
The penguins find a pigeon amid them. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS238
00:34:52,00 --> 00:34:58,50
It flies off, and Captain watches, its flippers flapping. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS239
00:34:56,00 --> 00:35:00,50
SOMEONE meets the penguins gaze. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS240
00:35:00,00 --> 00:35:04,50
Captain flaps again. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS241
00:35:11,00 --> 00:35:15,50
Captain looks down. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS242
00:35:14,00 --> 00:35:18,50
SOMEONE catches the ball. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS243
00:35:18,00 --> 00:35:24,50
He tosses it back, then joins SOMEONE. The penguins follow. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS244
00:35:30,00 --> 00:35:36,50
SOMEONE passes the ball. As SOMEONE kicks it back, the penguins play with them. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS245
00:35:43,00 --> 00:35:48,50
The ball rolls over to SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS246
00:35:50,00 --> 00:35:54,50
He mimes texting. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS247
00:35:56,00 --> 00:36:01,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS248
00:35:59,00 --> 00:36:03,50
She stands. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS249
00:36:05,00 --> 00:36:10,50
SOMEONE kicks the ball and it smashes SOMEONE's face. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS250
00:36:08,00 --> 00:36:14,50
SOMEONE falls back. The penguins imitate him. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS251
00:36:13,00 --> 00:36:20,50
Later, tissue hangs from SOMEONE's nostril as he watches a family board an elevator. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS252
00:36:23,00 --> 00:36:27,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS253
00:36:32,00 --> 00:36:37,50
He gives SOMEONE more cash. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS255
00:36:36,00 --> 00:36:43,50
Nimrod bumps into a wall, then waddles off alone. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS256
00:36:40,00 --> 00:36:45,50
SOMEONE counts his cash. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS257
00:36:42,00 --> 00:36:49,50
Later, under blankets, the family watches SOMEONE get blown across a snowy cabin. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS258
00:36:46,00 --> 00:36:51,50
SOMEONE enters with a penguin in her hands. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS266
00:37:02,00 --> 00:37:11,50
Smiling, SOMEONE sits. She watches the SOMEONE movie, then grins at her ex-husband. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS279
00:37:37,00 --> 00:37:46,50
SOMEONE steps around the couch and SOMEONE follows. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS280
00:37:43,00 --> 00:37:48,50
She gives SOMEONE a kiss. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS281
00:37:45,00 --> 00:37:50,50
She hugs SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS283
00:37:49,00 --> 00:37:55,50
As she turns to SOMEONE, they almost kiss, but hug instead. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS284
00:37:54,00 --> 00:37:59,50
He watches her step out. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS285
00:37:58,00 --> 00:38:03,50
The kids notice their father's lingering gaze. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS287
00:38:04,00 --> 00:38:09,50
SOMEONE stands awkwardly. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS292
00:38:19,00 --> 00:38:24,50
Now the penguins sleep on SOMEONE's bed. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS293
00:38:21,00 --> 00:38:26,50
SOMEONE eyes them, brushing his teeth. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS294
00:38:23,00 --> 00:38:28,50
He wears a thick vest and gloves. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS295
00:38:25,00 --> 00:38:29,50
Now on his cell. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS299
00:38:36,00 --> 00:38:40,50
With an older woman. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS302
00:38:58,00 --> 00:39:06,50
He leads her to the penguins who watch SOMEONE. The babysitter stares, then faces him plainly. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS303
00:39:10,00 --> 00:39:17,50
Nighttime. SOMEONE steps outside in a tuxedo and waves to hail a cab. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS304
00:39:14,00 --> 00:39:21,50
He drops his arm to his side, checks his watch, then marches off. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS305
00:39:19,00 --> 00:39:27,50
Crossing a row of street vendors he notices a five foot tall stuffed penguin standing at the end. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS306
00:39:26,00 --> 00:39:31,50
SOMEONE reaches into his jacket and takes out his cell phone. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS307
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:51,50
The babysitter sits on a remote control and the channel changes to a show featuring a sea lion. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS308
00:39:50,00 --> 00:39:58,50
Frightened, the penguins charge the babysitter who runs out of the apartment leaving the front door open. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS309
00:39:55,00 --> 00:40:01,50
One penguin holds the door for the others as they leave. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS310
00:39:58,00 --> 00:40:03,50
Nimrod bumps into the dresser on his way out. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS311
00:40:01,00 --> 00:40:06,50
In the lobby, Kent faces SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS312
00:40:17,00 --> 00:40:22,50
SOMEONE sees the penguins leaving the elevator. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS313
00:40:28,00 --> 00:40:35,50
Outside the penguins cross a wet sidewalk bordered by mounds of snow. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS314
00:40:32,00 --> 00:40:39,50
They reach the curb, then hop onto the street and march off in single file. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS315
00:40:37,00 --> 00:40:50,50
Now taxis drive past the Guggenheim, a white cylindrical building reminiscent of a beehive. Elegant guests gather inside the multitiered rotunda where SOMEONE hands SOMEONE a bottle of Champaign. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS316
00:40:55,00 --> 00:41:01,50
She smiles in her elegant lavender gown. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS317
00:40:58,00 --> 00:41:04,50
Meanwhile, the penguins pass the row of street vendors. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS318
00:41:01,00 --> 00:41:07,50
Lovey slows to a stop on spotting the giant stuffed penguin. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS319
00:41:07,00 --> 00:41:11,50
He bows. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS320
00:41:09,00 --> 00:41:15,50
The white-chested penguin bears a black SOMEONE over his heart. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS321
00:41:12,00 --> 00:41:17,50
As the penguin swoons, another approaches. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS322
00:41:16,00 --> 00:41:20,50
Lovey follows the penguin off. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS323
00:41:17,00 --> 00:41:25,50
With their flippers up, the line of penguins walks past the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS324
00:41:23,00 --> 00:41:27,50
At the Guggenheim, 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS325
00:41:36,00 --> 00:41:40,50
a server brings Champaign. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS326
00:41:40,00 --> 00:41:46,50
The server leaves. SOMEONE unwraps his bottle and pops the cork. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS327
00:41:46,00 --> 00:41:53,50
As an old man yawns, SOMEONE casually catches the cork before it enters his mouth. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS328
00:41:58,00 --> 00:42:06,50
SOMEONE watches SOMEONE go, then leans back on a railing next to a white-haired man. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS329
00:42:08,00 --> 00:42:13,50
Sipping form a bottle, SOMEONE eyes the man. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS330
00:42:11,00 --> 00:42:19,50
He holds the bottle as if pouring it into his ear, and spits Champaign. He tosses the bottle in a trash can. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS331
00:42:17,00 --> 00:42:21,50
He heads off. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS332
00:42:18,00 --> 00:42:26,50
Outside, Captain sniffs around, leading the group down a sidewalk en route to the Guggenheim. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS333
00:42:26,00 --> 00:42:36,50
Inside, our view roves up the museum's spiraling tiers. SOMEONE and Mrs. SOMEONE stand before a painting of a large black dot. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS334
00:42:53,00 --> 00:43:01,50
SOMEONE spots the penguins on a lower tier across the rotunda. They spot him too. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS335
00:43:02,00 --> 00:43:08,50
As they head up the spiral SOMEONE watches them over her shoulder. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS336
00:43:19,00 --> 00:43:23,50
He escorts her to an elevator. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS337
00:43:21,00 --> 00:43:26,50
The penguins catch up. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS338
00:43:23,00 --> 00:43:30,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE step onboard and the elevator doors shut the penguins out. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS339
00:43:31,00 --> 00:43:46,50
As Captain leads the group back down the spiral, he collides with a server's white barrel, spilling water onto the smooth floor. The penguins dive on their bellies, using the wet floor to slide down the long, sloping, continuous spiral. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS340
00:43:48,00 --> 00:43:52,50
A man steps out of their way. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS341
00:43:49,00 --> 00:43:55,50
Dancing with SOMEONE, SOMEONE looks up. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS342
00:43:52,00 --> 00:43:56,50
SOMEONE does the same. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS343
00:43:53,00 --> 00:44:00,50
On their way down, the penguins trip a couple and rip off a woman's dress. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS344
00:43:57,00 --> 00:44:07,50
More patrons jump out of their way. SOMEONE looks over SOMEONE's shoulder. As a man tips over the railing, his date catches his leg. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS346
00:44:07,00 --> 00:44:12,50
SOMEONE waves his hands in her face.

SOMEONE gives a resigned look. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS535
01:04:24,00 --> 01:04:28,50
SOMEONE's eyes remain on the egg. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS536

01:04:43,00 --> 01:04:51,50
Later, on his terrace, he builds a small covering with wooden beams with blankets draped across them. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS542
01:04:48,00 --> 01:04:55,50
He places the egg underneath, in a rock nest snuggled within a blanket. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS544
01:04:54,00 --> 01:05:03,50
SOMEONE sits on the terrace. His back propped against one of the covering's six foot legs and stares at the unhatched egg. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS546
01:05:05,00 --> 01:05:12,50
He heats a spoon on a turbine vent, then glances at the egg as he eats from a pot. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS548
01:05:11,00 --> 01:05:15,50
His hands hover around the egg. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS549
01:05:30,00 --> 01:05:36,50
He lifts his hands from the egg and stares with devastated eyes. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS550
01:05:33,00 --> 01:05:38,50
Sitting back, he clutches himself. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS552
01:05:40,00 --> 01:05:47,50
SOMEONE crouches over the egg and presses a stethoscope to it. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS553
01:05:44,00 --> 01:05:48,50
Standing nearby, 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS554
01:05:45,00 --> 01:05:51,50
SOMEONE watches as the zookeeper listens carefully. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS555
01:05:48,00 --> 01:05:54,50
SOMEONE lifts his gaze to the rugged, unshaven man and shakes his head. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS556
01:05:52,00 --> 01:05:58,50
SOMEONE's shoulders heave, and he gives an anguished look. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS557
01:05:57,00 --> 01:06:03,50
With a final glance at the egg, he trudges off. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS558
01:06:00,00 --> 01:06:06,50
Later, he stands on the terrace with his back to the open doorway. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS559
01:06:04,00 --> 01:06:10,50
Behind him, in the apartment, the penguins cluster together and watch him. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS560
01:06:08,00 --> 01:06:12,50
SOMEONE approaches. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS561
01:06:15,00 --> 01:06:19,50
SOMEONE continues to stare off. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS562
01:06:20,00 --> 01:06:25,50
The penguin owner shifts his sad eyes. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS563
01:06:22,00 --> 01:06:29,50
Turning slightly he gives SOMEONE a nod, then faces the city again. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS564
01:06:27,00 --> 01:06:31,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS565
01:06:28,00 --> 01:06:34,50
As he crouches in front of the penguins, they move a few steps away. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS566
01:06:35,00 --> 01:06:41,50
SOMEONE backs into the apartment and pulls the terrace door shut. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS567
01:06:38,00 --> 01:06:48,50
Now in the boardroom at SOMEONE, Reader and Yates, a young man displays a photo of the Statue of Liberty with a similar statue right next to it. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS568
01:07:44,00 --> 01:07:48,50
SOMEONE watches them leave. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS569
01:07:47,00 --> 01:07:52,50
Later, outside the apartment, 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS570
01:08:01,00 --> 01:08:08,50
SOMEONE races into the apartment and finds it returned to its original state. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS571
01:08:05,00 --> 01:08:12,50
His smile fades as he gazes around the immaculate living room. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS572
01:08:09,00 --> 01:08:13,50
He turns to SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS573
01:08:42,00 --> 01:08:46,50
SOMEONE blinks back tears. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS574
01:08:53,00 --> 01:08:57,50
She turns away. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS575
01:08:55,00 --> 01:09:03,50
As SOMEONE follows her upstairs, SOMEONE watches, then turns to her ex-husband. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS576
01:09:07,00 --> 01:09:11,50
He sits. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS577
01:09:18,00 --> 01:09:23,50
SOMEONE gives a wounded look. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS578
01:09:26,00 --> 01:09:30,50
She heads to the door. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS579
01:09:35,00 --> 01:09:39,50
She glares at the back of his head. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS580
01:09:39,00 --> 01:09:43,50
Without turning, he nods. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS581
01:09:40,00 --> 01:09:47,50
As SOMEONE storms out of the apartment, SOMEONE stares with a frown. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS582
01:09:45,00 --> 01:09:52,50
Later, he gazes sadly at his laptop as he clicks through photos of the penguins. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS583
01:09:49,00 --> 01:09:52,50
Lovey stands in some snow. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS585
01:09:51,00 --> 01:09:57,50
In another, two penguins look down at their egg. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS587
01:09:55,00 --> 01:10:00,50
Riding in a limo, SOMEONE makes a call. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS588
01:10:05,00 --> 01:10:10,50
In his apartment, SOMEONE drops his keys. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS589
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:17,50
He lowers himself onto his hands and knees and peers under the dresser. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS590
01:10:15,00 --> 01:10:21,50
His keys sit in front of the envelope from inside Captain's crate. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS591
01:10:18,00 --> 01:10:26,50
Furrowing his brow, he slides the envelope out and stares at the handwritten name on its front. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS593
01:10:25,00 --> 01:10:29,50
with a wistful look, 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS594
01:10:26,00 --> 01:10:32,50
he stands and slips his finger under the envelope's flap. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS595
01:10:30,00 --> 01:10:35,50
Opening it, he pulls out a letter and reads. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS596
01:11:03,00 --> 01:11:07,50
SOMEONE swallows. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS597
01:11:05,00 --> 01:11:12,50
As he lifts his gaze toward the second floor, his face hardens in a resolute look. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS598
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:15,50
Now he leads SOMEONE and SOMEONE to the limo. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS599
01:11:19,00 --> 01:11:24,50
SOMEONE climbs in after them. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS600
01:11:30,00 --> 01:11:34,50
The kids high-five. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS601
01:11:32,00 --> 01:11:38,50
Now at the press conference, Mrs. SOMEONE stands at a podium. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS602
01:11:35,00 --> 01:11:40,50
She notes an empty seat beside SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS603
01:11:41,00 --> 01:11:46,50
In the limo, SOMEONE nods at SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS604
01:11:45,00 --> 01:11:49,50
He leans closer. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS605
01:12:02,00 --> 01:12:06,50
She offers him her phone. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS606
01:12:11,00 --> 01:12:17,50
With a smile, he takes the phone and dials, then lifts it to his ear. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS607
01:12:19,00 --> 01:12:23,50
In a cab, SOMEONE sits with SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS608
01:12:54,00 --> 01:12:58,50
He looks at his kids. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS609
01:12:58,00 --> 01:13:03,50
They nod. SOMEONE smiles sadly. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS610
01:13:09,00 --> 01:13:13,50
SOMEONE grins at her brother. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS611
01:13:11,00 --> 01:13:16,50
In the cab, SOMEONE lowers the phone with a thoughtful look. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS612
01:13:15,00 --> 01:13:19,50
She glances at SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS613
01:13:20,00 --> 01:13:25,50
Now at the zoo's ticket booth 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS614
01:13:36,00 --> 01:13:42,50
The SOMEONE enter the cavern-like penguin exhibit. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS615
01:13:49,00 --> 01:13:55,50
They burst into SOMEONE's office, and find him on the phone. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS616
01:15:03,00 --> 01:15:08,50
Mr. SOMEONE opens a holding tank. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS617
01:15:07,00 --> 01:15:12,50
Bitey nips at SOMEONE's finger. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS618
01:15:17,00 --> 01:15:25,50
Luring the birds with sardines, he steps into the holding tank. Mr. SOMEONE shuts him in. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS619
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:29,50
Later, in a veterinary lab, he finds a stack of surgical masks. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS620
01:15:34,00 --> 01:15:38,50
In SOMEONE's office, 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS621
01:15:36,00 --> 01:15:41,50
a guard opens the tank door 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS623
01:15:59,00 --> 01:16:05,50
Zoo-goers hustle away from the masked family. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS624
01:16:04,00 --> 01:16:09,50
He points to a door, but SOMEONE emerges. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS625
01:16:08,00 --> 01:16:13,50
SOMEONE swivels his pointed arm. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS626
01:16:11,00 --> 01:16:20,50
Removing their masks, the SOMEONE walk nonchalantly into a gift shop, followed by the penguins in single file. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS627
01:16:17,00 --> 01:16:23,50
Nimrod bumps into a fixture and stumbles, 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS628
01:16:20,00 --> 01:16:24,50
bringing up the rear. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS629
01:16:21,00 --> 01:16:28,50
Captain gets her webbed foot twisted in a kite string dangling from a high shelf. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS630
01:16:25,00 --> 01:16:35,50
She turns in a circle becoming entwined. A basketball tumbles from the shelf and knocks her to the floor. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS631
01:16:32,00 --> 01:16:38,50
Two guards, armed with nets, spire from the entrance. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS632
01:16:36,00 --> 01:16:47,50
Captain flees with a colorful kite strapped to her back which knocks toys off display shelves as she runs past. She escapes into an elevator. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS633
01:16:46,00 --> 01:16:51,50
Outside, SOMEONE paces by the limo. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS634
01:16:49,00 --> 01:17:07,50
Nearby, a big guard intercepts a mother and daughter trying to leave the zoo. SOMEONE checks her cell phone. A text from Mr. SOMEONE reads: Produce a perturbance! SOMEONE eyes her boss lingering in a doorway. She gives him a nod, then strides toward the guard, swoons, and falls on her back. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS635
01:17:09,00 --> 01:17:13,50
The SOMEONE sneak out. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS636
01:17:16,00 --> 01:17:21,50
The family nears the guard crouching over SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS637
01:17:26,00 --> 01:17:31,50
SOMEONE turns a corner and spots the SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS638
01:17:30,00 --> 01:17:42,50
As the group races to the limo, SOMEONE wrestles the big guard to the ground. SOMEONE swings a catch pole and misses. Mr. SOMEONE closes and latches the zoo's gates, locking him inside. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS639
01:17:52,00 --> 01:18:00,50
They see Captain sliding down to the edge of a high rooftop. The two guards follow close behind. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS640
01:17:59,00 --> 01:18:03,50
She peers at the ground below. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS641
01:18:03,00 --> 01:18:09,50
Flapping her flippers, she steps to the precipice. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS642
01:18:08,00 --> 01:18:14,50
She jumps! As she plummets head first toward the ground, the 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS643
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:18,50
kite on her back spreads like wings and she soars into the air. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS644
01:18:15,00 --> 01:18:21,50
Mr. SOMEONE fearfully opens his eyes, and gapes. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS645
01:18:25,00 --> 01:18:33,50
As she soars over SOMEONE, he readies his catch-pole. Mr. SOMEONE grabs it and pulls it through the bars of the gate. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS646
01:18:32,00 --> 01:18:41,50
He tightens the cable loop around SOMEONE's wrists. Captain swoops to the limo and drops into its open sunroof. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS647
01:18:41,00 --> 01:18:46,50
With the pole, he shoves SOMEONE's hands into his face. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS648
01:18:47,00 --> 01:18:54,50
He anchors the pole, securing the SOMEONE's bound hands between the bars. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS649
01:18:54,00 --> 01:18:58,50
He leaves. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS650
01:18:57,00 --> 01:19:01,50
In the limo 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS651
01:19:07,00 --> 01:19:13,50
The big guard helps free SOMEONE who races to a worker passing in a golf cart. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS652
01:19:11,00 --> 01:19:18,50
He throws him out, then speeds off in the cart. Now at the press conference 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS653
01:19:27,00 --> 01:19:33,50
Mr. SOMEONE bursts in, pretending to run in slow motion. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS654
01:20:27,00 --> 01:20:32,50
SOMEONE arrives with the police. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS655
01:20:42,00 --> 01:20:47,50
He sees SOMEONE trying to wrangle the approaching penguins. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS656
01:21:28,00 --> 01:21:32,50
SOMEONE takes out a sardine. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS657
01:21:30,00 --> 01:21:36,50
With a penguins between them, they each take a few steps back. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS658
01:21:34,00 --> 01:21:39,50
Mr. SOMEONE gives a confident nod. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS659
01:21:36,00 --> 01:21:44,50
As SOMEONE wiggles the sardine. The penguins glance at his rival, then return their gazes to the fish. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS660
01:21:45,00 --> 01:21:52,50
As they move toward the sardine, Captain glances uneasily at Mr. SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS661
01:21:50,00 --> 01:21:54,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS662
01:21:54,00 --> 01:21:59,50
Captain addresses the others. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS663
01:21:57,00 --> 01:22:02,50
The penguins rush back to the SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS664
01:22:01,00 --> 01:22:09,50
Mrs. SOMEONE smiles, and her staff claps. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS665
01:22:15,00 --> 01:22:22,50
He starts a round of applause. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS666
01:22:35,00 --> 01:22:42,50
SOMEONE brings Mrs. SOMEONE a cell phone and she speed-dials a call. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS667
01:22:54,00 --> 01:22:59,50
The cop shakes her hand. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS668
01:22:57,00 --> 01:23:01,50
He grins. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS669
01:22:59,00 --> 01:23:04,50
With a smitten look, she leaves with him. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS670
01:23:15,00 --> 01:23:20,50
Mr. SOMEONE glances at his bosses. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS671
01:23:19,00 --> 01:23:23,50
She looks toward the corner table. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS672
01:23:36,00 --> 01:23:41,50
Reader and Yates exchange a glance. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS673
01:23:40,00 --> 01:23:56,50
Springtime. The SOMEONE pass colorful flower beds as they approach the building. Inside, the hostess takes four menus reading, "Tavern on the Green. A SOMEONE, Reader, Yates and SOMEONE subsidiary," and leads the guests into the dining area. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS674
01:23:54,00 --> 01:24:02,50
At a small table, SOMEONE and Quint pause their conversation and gaze at Mr. SOMEONE as he passes. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS675
01:23:59,00 --> 01:24:03,50
He gives them a pleased look. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS676
01:24:01,00 --> 01:24:07,50
SOMEONE gins as he crosses his path with a pitcher of water. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS677
01:24:04,00 --> 01:24:13,50
Pointing his finger like a gun, Mr. SOMEONE smiles at a table where his business partners dine with Mrs. SOMEONE. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS678
01:24:10,00 --> 01:24:15,50
The old woman beams at him. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS679
01:24:12,00 --> 01:24:20,50
With a wistful look, he watches the hostess set the menus on four place settings at the corner table. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS680
01:24:18,00 --> 01:24:24,50
He gives a wide grin, then sits with his family. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS681
01:24:47,00 --> 01:24:51,50
The kids fist-bump. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS682
01:24:53,00 --> 01:24:59,50
Holding her gaze, Mr. SOMEONE twitches a faint smile. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS683
01:24:59,00 --> 01:25:08,50
A gust of snowflakes obscures our view, then clears to reveal the family in goggles and winter coats with fur-lined hoods. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS684
01:25:05,00 --> 01:25:10,50
They walk a snowy arctic ridge. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS685
01:25:12,00 --> 01:25:18,50
The six penguins and two babies walk in single file behind them. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS686
01:25:16,00 --> 01:25:23,50
Below the ridge, hundreds of penguins mill around a snow-packed shore. 

MR_POPPERS_PENGUINS_DVS687
01:25:21,00 --> 01:25:25,50
As the family heads down to them,
