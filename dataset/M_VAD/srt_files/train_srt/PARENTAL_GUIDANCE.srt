PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS14
00:03:25,00 --> 00:03:29,50
He stares off nostalgically. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS15
00:03:28,00 --> 00:03:33,50
Later SOMEONE sits with his boss. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS16
00:04:26,00 --> 00:04:33,50
Now the aging announcer wears a fedora as he looks out at the empty ballpark. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS17
00:04:30,00 --> 00:04:38,50
He somberly walks away past a giant poster featuring his head with a Fresno Grizzly's hat. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS19
00:04:38,00 --> 00:04:43,50
As SOMEONE leaves the lights go out one by one. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS21
00:04:46,00 --> 00:04:53,50
Later outside a ranch style home A vintage red convertible Mustang sits in the driveway. Its license plate reads DAVOICE. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS22
00:04:51,00 --> 00:04:59,50
SOMEONE site in the driver's seat watching a stuffed grizzly bear swing from the rear view mirror.  

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS23
00:04:56,00 --> 00:05:03,50
Inside the house, a short blonde in her 60s exhaustively works out on a stripper pole. An instructor leads her and three other middle-aged women on their own poles. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS24
00:05:12,00 --> 00:05:17,50
SOMEONE exits his car and approaches the front door. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS25
00:05:17,00 --> 00:05:22,50
SOMEONE enters. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS26
00:05:29,00 --> 00:05:34,50
He despondently passes the women. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS27
00:05:40,00 --> 00:05:46,50
SOMEONE watches her husband slump into the kitchen. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS29
00:06:36,00 --> 00:06:41,50
SOMEONE looks down, then hugs his wife. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS30
00:06:41,00 --> 00:06:50,50
Now an aerial view shows the Atlanta skyline. in a large suburban home a wall mounted screen turns on. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS34
00:07:57,00 --> 00:08:03,50
A boy in only a cape and underwear rides in on a scooter. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS35
00:08:15,00 --> 00:08:19,50
SOMEONE rushes to his father. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS37
00:08:29,00 --> 00:08:35,50
The wavy haired man pulls his wife across the patio and kisses her. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS39
00:09:24,00 --> 00:09:28,50
They embrace. Now on the phone. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS40
00:09:36,00 --> 00:09:41,50
Nighttime in the master bedroom. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS41
00:09:56,00 --> 00:10:00,50
He holds out a phone. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS42
00:09:57,00 --> 00:10:06,50
She hesitantly takes it and dials. Holding the phone to her ear. She listens for a moment then drops it. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS43
00:10:08,00 --> 00:10:12,50
She squirms. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS44
00:10:45,00 --> 00:10:49,50
They stare into each other's eyes. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS45
00:10:49,00 --> 00:10:54,50
As they kiss, SOMEONE jumps on the bed. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS46
00:10:59,00 --> 00:11:07,50
Now on the SOMEONE's patio, SOMEONE cooks at the grill. Inside, SOMEONE listens to the iPod. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS49
00:11:24,00 --> 00:11:29,50
SOMEONE slides the phone into a dock. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS50
00:11:41,00 --> 00:11:46,50
SOMEONE glances at her husband. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS51
00:11:53,00 --> 00:11:58,50
SOMEONE shakes his head and mouths no. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS52
00:12:01,00 --> 00:12:05,50
SOMEONE's jaw drops. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS53
00:12:53,00 --> 00:12:58,50
He watches her walk away and sighs. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS54
00:13:07,00 --> 00:13:12,50
Now at the airport, a TSA agent searches SOMEONE. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS55
00:13:22,00 --> 00:13:26,50
He turns his head. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS57
00:13:53,00 --> 00:13:59,50
Smiling SOMEONE takes his wife's hand. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS60
00:14:36,00 --> 00:14:43,50
She pulls them all into a hug. The taxi pulls into the driveway. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS61
00:14:42,00 --> 00:14:48,50
The children peer through the window blinds. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS62
00:14:46,00 --> 00:14:54,50
SOMEONE's eyes widen as she watches SOMEONE emerge from the taxi. At the front door. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS63
00:15:04,00 --> 00:15:11,50
She kisses each of them on the cheeks leaving huge lipstick marks. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS65
00:15:50,00 --> 00:15:54,50
He opens his bag. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS67
00:16:41,00 --> 00:16:47,50
Inside, the monitor shows an animated front door closing. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS68
00:17:11,00 --> 00:17:16,50
SOMEONE spins with his hands in the air. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS69
00:17:58,00 --> 00:18:04,50
On the mantle photos show the kids with their other grandparents. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS72
00:18:15,00 --> 00:18:19,50
He runs and looks back. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS75
00:18:33,00 --> 00:18:37,50
She saunters away. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS76
00:19:10,00 --> 00:19:19,50
Now a neon sign above a restaurant entrance reads, Healthy Tiger. Inside, the owner greets the family. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS78
00:19:54,00 --> 00:19:58,50
The family sits. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS79
00:20:11,00 --> 00:20:16,50
SOMEONE leans toward SOMEONE. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS80
00:20:20,00 --> 00:20:25,50
SOMEONE gauges her mother's response. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS81
00:21:41,00 --> 00:21:45,50
SOMEONE shrugs affably. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS82
00:21:46,00 --> 00:21:51,50
Later, SOMEONE scribbles on a kid's placement. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS84
00:22:38,00 --> 00:22:42,50
He runs off. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS85
00:22:41,00 --> 00:22:49,50
Morning, outside the house. SOMEONE clings to SOMEONE as SOMEONE struggles to pull her away. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS88
00:23:38,00 --> 00:23:43,50
SOMEONE kisses her and faces the driver. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS89
00:24:05,00 --> 00:24:11,50
Behind them, the car reverses then drives off again. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS91
00:24:36,00 --> 00:24:42,50
Pulling them from a toaster oven, SOMEONE tosses them to SOMEONE. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS95
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:09,50
She quickly cuts. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS96
00:25:07,00 --> 00:25:12,50
Later, SOMEONE wears his mother's high-heels. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS98
00:25:38,00 --> 00:25:45,50
As she goes, SOMEONE sternly folds his arms across his chest. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS99
00:25:46,00 --> 00:25:50,50
In a car. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS101
00:26:35,00 --> 00:26:42,50
SOMEONE climbs in beside SOMEONE. Now at Brookcliff Academy. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS103
00:27:08,00 --> 00:27:12,50
SOMEONE rushes off. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS104
00:27:24,00 --> 00:27:28,50
SOMEONE encounters bullies. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS106
00:27:34,00 --> 00:27:39,50
SOMEONE starts over. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS107
00:27:46,00 --> 00:27:50,50
She checks her phone. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS108
00:28:07,00 --> 00:28:21,50
Now the family SUV pulls up outside another school. As SOMEONE hops out and opens the side door, we glimpse a sign. Anchor Charter School. In the back SOMEONE sits in a complicated safety seat. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS109
00:28:29,00 --> 00:28:38,50
Climbing in, SOMEONE pauses at the side of the complex network of buckles. A woman behind him honks impatiently. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS110
00:28:46,00 --> 00:28:52,50
SOMEONE grins and waves, then frantically fumbles at the buckles. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS112
00:29:06,00 --> 00:29:14,50
Now a friend stands by as SOMEONE fits her violin case in her locker. A cute boy approaches. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS113
00:29:35,00 --> 00:29:40,50
SOMEONE's smile fades. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS115
00:29:59,00 --> 00:30:04,50
At home SOMEONE uses a touch screen. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS116
00:30:37,00 --> 00:30:42,50
Getting a snack, SOMEONE freezes. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS117
00:30:39,00 --> 00:30:47,50
Now SOMEONE's purse and laptop bag rest at her feet as she sits glumly on the stoop of the academy. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS118
00:30:44,00 --> 00:30:50,50
SOMEONE pulls up and faces her through the window. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS119
00:30:49,00 --> 00:30:54,50
She angrily holds up five fingers. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS120
00:30:54,00 --> 00:31:02,50
Now we gaze out over Atlanta's skyscrapers which stand interwoven with thick sections of woodlands. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS121
00:30:59,00 --> 00:31:04,50
Now on a mall's escalator. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS122
00:31:15,00 --> 00:31:23,50
At a speech therapy session a little girls mimes riding a horse for a group of kids sitting in a circle. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS123
00:31:34,00 --> 00:31:41,50
The little boy nods. As he gets to his feet SOMEONE smiles proudly. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS124
00:31:38,00 --> 00:31:45,50
SOMEONE spreads his arms wide like wings, then walks around in a circle. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS125
00:31:53,00 --> 00:31:59,50
Wearing a puzzled frown, SOMEONE claps slowly. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS127
00:32:45,00 --> 00:32:54,50
SOMEONE mimes being trapped in a box, changing facial expressions with the sweep of the hand and tugging a rope. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS128
00:32:56,00 --> 00:33:01,50
Cassandra stares, unsmiling. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS129
00:33:32,00 --> 00:33:37,50
SOMEONE arrives behind him. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS130
00:33:41,00 --> 00:33:46,50
The boy moves off with a wounded pout. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS131
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:54,50
SOMEONE follows the boy. Now SOMEONE leaves the fitting room in a shapeless black dress. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS133
00:35:01,00 --> 00:35:08,50
SOMEONE picks up her choice. A flouncy party dress with straps. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS134
00:35:20,00 --> 00:35:24,50
A slinky dress. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS135
00:35:26,00 --> 00:35:32,50
At home, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE with his back against a door. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS136
00:35:39,00 --> 00:35:44,50
SOMEONE demonstrates a pinched pout. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS137
00:36:08,00 --> 00:36:12,50
SOMEONE nods. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS138
00:36:16,00 --> 00:36:22,50
SOMEONE offers some cash. SOMEONE snatches it. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS139
00:36:23,00 --> 00:36:29,50
SOMEONE enters the room and finds SOMEONE lying face down on a bed. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS140
00:36:49,00 --> 00:36:56,50
Now the living room flat screen shows a scary puppet riding a tricycle. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS141
00:36:55,00 --> 00:37:00,50
SOMEONE clicks a remote turning it off. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS142
00:36:59,00 --> 00:37:03,50
Later in the kitchen. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS144
00:37:31,00 --> 00:37:41,50
Facing a large monitor SOMEONE glances at the boys. Reads the email headed Announcer Auditions, and dials a number off the screen. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS145
00:37:46,00 --> 00:37:52,50
SOMEONE ducks into the next room leaving the boys to their ice cream. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS146
00:37:50,00 --> 00:37:55,50
They grin at each other with twinkling eyes. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS147
00:38:04,00 --> 00:38:08,50
In the foyer. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS148
00:38:17,00 --> 00:38:21,50
She answers her cell. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS151
00:38:40,00 --> 00:38:46,50
As SOMEONE chases the boys around in circles, SOMEONE comes in. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS152
00:39:03,00 --> 00:39:07,50
SOMEONE video phones in. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS153
00:39:10,00 --> 00:39:16,50
SOMEONE ends the call leaving SOMEONE staring. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS156
00:39:24,00 --> 00:39:31,50
SOMEONE tries to wrench the cake tray from her, but she clutches it like a wild animal. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS158
00:39:54,00 --> 00:39:58,50
Later on video chat. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS159
00:40:15,00 --> 00:40:19,50
She sucks cake from her hair. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS160
00:40:23,00 --> 00:40:31,50
She blows him a kiss. In the guest room SOMEONE sulks listening to his iPod. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS161
00:41:03,00 --> 00:41:08,50
SOMEONE sighs as SOMEONE brushes past. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS162
00:41:12,00 --> 00:41:18,50
As she steps into the bathroom SOMEONE heaves another heavy sigh. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS163
00:41:17,00 --> 00:41:23,50
Now we float over Atlanta's gold domed capital building. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS164
00:41:21,00 --> 00:41:29,50
At the Music Academy for the Arts, SOMEONE beams proudly as a window shows SOMEONE rehearsing a piece on the violin. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS165
00:41:27,00 --> 00:41:33,50
A stick-thin woman with a copper red SOMEONE and severe features approaches her. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS166
00:41:36,00 --> 00:41:41,50
SOMEONE glumly comes out of the rehearsal room. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS167
00:41:48,00 --> 00:41:52,50
Her teacher emerges. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS169
00:42:44,00 --> 00:42:50,50
SOMEONE's joyful smile fades into a panicked expression. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS170
00:42:56,00 --> 00:43:02,50
SOMEONE rushes out. Her teacher passes SOMEONE again. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS172
00:43:17,00 --> 00:43:21,50
She marches out. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS173
00:43:18,00 --> 00:43:23,50
Now we drift over Piedmont Park. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS174
00:43:21,00 --> 00:43:26,50
On a baseball field two teams warm up. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS177
00:43:29,00 --> 00:43:38,50
The orange team fumbles their way through a warmup game of catch. They struggle through sit-ups, toe touches, and pushups. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS179
00:43:50,00 --> 00:43:54,50
He takes a big bite. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS180
00:44:13,00 --> 00:44:19,50
With two other boys SOMEONE draws on a sidewalk with chalk. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS181
00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:21,50
On the field, they put all their hands in the middle. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS182
00:44:25,00 --> 00:44:31,50
In the stands, they sit. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS183
00:45:13,00 --> 00:45:22,50
On the mound, SOMEONE gazes intently at his bully who scowls. SOMEONE flexes his fingers against the handle. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS184
00:45:19,00 --> 00:45:25,50
SOMEONE throws a clean shot straight into the catcher's mitt. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS185
00:45:37,00 --> 00:45:43,50
SOMEONE narrows his eyes. SOMEONE pitches. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS186
00:45:54,00 --> 00:45:59,50
The catcher signals between his legs. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS188
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:04,50
SOMEONE nods. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS189
00:46:39,00 --> 00:46:43,50
SOMEONE buries his face in his mitt. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS190
00:47:43,00 --> 00:47:48,50
SOMEONE bats SOMEONE in the crotch. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS191
00:47:55,00 --> 00:48:00,50
SOMEONE leans in close. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS194
00:48:00,00 --> 00:48:06,50
SOMEONE gags. SOMEONE pats SOMEONE's shoulder. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS195
00:48:05,00 --> 00:48:10,50
Later, SOMEONE ices his crotch. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS197
00:49:04,00 --> 00:49:09,50
SOMEONE ends the call with a resigned smirk. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS198
00:49:07,00 --> 00:49:12,50
At the park, SOMEONE faces her family. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS199
00:50:24,00 --> 00:50:29,50
She muscles SOMEONE into a car. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS200
00:50:29,00 --> 00:50:33,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS201
00:50:35,00 --> 00:50:47,50
Now our view takes in a picturesque coastal town with a lighthouse painted in red and white stripes. In an upscale suite, Our Life pamphlets lie near a desk where SOMEONE works. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS202
00:50:47,00 --> 00:50:52,50
He gets to his feet and lumbers to the door. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS203
00:50:55,00 --> 00:51:03,50
Opening it, he finds SOMEONE facing him with a coy smile. He beams delightedly. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS204
00:51:03,00 --> 00:51:10,50
As she comes in, SOMEONE lifts her up in his arms and welcomes her with a big kiss. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS205
00:51:07,00 --> 00:51:12,50
Locked in the embrace, he shuts the door. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS207
00:51:11,00 --> 00:51:16,50
SOMEONE sleeps alone in the guest bedroom. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS208
00:51:14,00 --> 00:51:21,50
In the darkened living room, SOMEONE watches a baseball game on the flat screen TV. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS209
00:51:51,00 --> 00:51:57,50
His gaze wistful, he clicks the remote. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS210
00:51:54,00 --> 00:52:01,50
In the morning SOMEONE grins as he looks down and draws with a florescent pink paint pen. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS211
00:52:02,00 --> 00:52:06,50
He flees. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS212
00:52:04,00 --> 00:52:10,50
SOMEONE wakes, his face a mask of glow paint. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS213
00:52:12,00 --> 00:52:17,50
SOMEONE runs to the bathroom mirror. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS214
00:52:17,00 --> 00:52:24,50
Now on a train headed for the city, SOMEONE scrubs at SOMEONE's face with disinfecting gel. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS215
00:52:31,00 --> 00:52:37,50
Later at a station, SOMEONE leads her family off an escalator. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS216
00:52:48,00 --> 00:52:54,50
SOMEONE takes SOMEONE into a filthy restroom. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS217
00:52:53,00 --> 00:52:57,50
He tries the stalls. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS218
00:53:05,00 --> 00:53:10,50
SOMEONE covers the seat with toilet paper. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS219
00:53:17,00 --> 00:53:21,50
Outside the stall. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS220
00:53:34,00 --> 00:53:40,50
Holding SOMEONE on his lap, SOMEONE notes his straining SOMEONE. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS221
00:53:44,00 --> 00:53:48,50
The other men listen in. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS222
00:54:05,00 --> 00:54:09,50
At a concert hall. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS223
00:54:11,00 --> 00:54:19,50
The reunited family enters the auditorium as the orchestra tunes up. They breathlessly take their seats. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS224
00:54:21,00 --> 00:54:25,50
The house lights dim. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS225
00:54:26,00 --> 00:54:31,50
The paint on his face glows in the dark. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS226
00:54:31,00 --> 00:54:38,50
A young solo violinist takes the stage with a distinguished conductor. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS227
00:54:35,00 --> 00:54:42,50
As they bow, the conductor halts and frowns at the sight of SOMEONE's glowing face. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS228
00:54:39,00 --> 00:54:47,50
SOMEONE wears an enraptured smile. SOMEONE sits up excitedly as the concert begins. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS229
00:55:07,00 --> 00:55:12,50
Behind his back, SOMEONE runs off. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS230
00:55:16,00 --> 00:55:20,50
He shakes his head. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS232
00:55:21,00 --> 00:55:28,50
Going after him SOMEONE falls over the balcony railing and drops six feet. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS233
00:55:27,00 --> 00:55:32,50
He lands by a prim elderly woman. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS235
00:55:43,00 --> 00:55:49,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. Her smile fading. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS236
00:55:46,00 --> 00:55:54,50
SOMEONE crawls along a row sending patrons to their feet. SOMEONE drops to all fours too. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS239
00:56:30,00 --> 00:56:38,50
SOMEONE glances at his upraised hand, then sets SOMEONE on his feet. The boy runs to SOMEONE. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS240
00:56:40,00 --> 00:56:45,50
SOMEONE gives the conductor cash. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS241
00:56:52,00 --> 00:57:04,50
At the expo, the lighthouse sweeps its beam around in circles. At a party, an award bearing SOMEONE's name sits on a table. A crowd of guests boogie on the dance floor. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS242
00:57:02,00 --> 00:57:09,50
In their midst, SOMEONE and SOMEONE slow dance as they share a warm animated conversation. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS243
00:57:08,00 --> 00:57:13,50
In Atlanta, SOMEONE uses the phone. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS244
00:57:21,00 --> 00:57:25,50
At the kitchen table. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS245
00:57:28,00 --> 00:57:32,50
The kids arrive. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS246
00:58:14,00 --> 00:58:20,50
As SOMEONE and the kids try the meal, their smiles vanish. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS247
00:58:19,00 --> 00:58:24,50
Everyone raises their hands. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS248
00:58:21,00 --> 00:58:28,50
Later, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE controlling a computer game with a huge touch screen. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS249
00:59:33,00 --> 00:59:39,50
SOMEONE grins sheepishly. Now the kids leave the house. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS250
01:00:15,00 --> 01:00:19,50
SOMEONE drives SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS251
01:00:24,00 --> 01:00:28,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS252
01:00:32,00 --> 01:00:36,50
He nods. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS253
01:00:37,00 --> 01:00:45,50
Now in front of the school, SOMEONE wears a determined glare. He marches toward the huddle of bullies. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS254
01:00:54,00 --> 01:01:00,50
He gives a taunting lunge. On a soccer field. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS256
01:01:16,00 --> 01:01:24,50
Now a banner bears a logo, The X Games. A skater rides his board across a half pipe. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS257
01:01:21,00 --> 01:01:29,50
BMX riders do tricks. A young hip sportscaster interviews SOMEONE Hawk. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS258
01:01:40,00 --> 01:01:50,50
SOMEONE wears baggy track pants, a t-shirt over a long-sleeved hoodie, sleek framed sunglasses and a backwards Newsboy cap. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS259
01:01:47,00 --> 01:01:58,50
We ride a half pipe sharing the perspective of a skateboard's wheels. Dragging SOMEONE along by the hand, SOMEONE halts at the half pipes edge. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS262
01:02:07,00 --> 01:02:12,50
SOMEONE carries him off under his arm. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS263
01:02:41,00 --> 01:02:45,50
SOMEONE leaves with his skateboard. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS264
01:03:01,00 --> 01:03:07,50
SOMEONE hustled SOMEONE to one end of the announcers stand. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS265
01:03:16,00 --> 01:03:22,50
SOMEONE sits at a table. SOMEONE holds his own crotch. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS266
01:03:36,00 --> 01:03:42,50
SOMEONE slips out a notecard scrawled with terminology. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS267
01:03:49,00 --> 01:03:56,50
The announcer mirthfully spits his coffee. Behind them, SOMEONE sneaks off. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS269
01:04:09,00 --> 01:04:13,50
A cameraman aims at SOMEONE. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS271
01:04:21,00 --> 01:04:31,50
Hitting the puddle, SOMEONE Hawk slides out of control and flies toward SOMEONE. SOMEONE hugs his grandson and shields him with his body. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS272
01:04:28,00 --> 01:04:35,50
Missing them, SOMEONE plunges to the bottom of the ramp and lands hard in a sprawl. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS273
01:04:33,00 --> 01:04:42,50
Now in a park, SOMEONE drops his hip clothes into a trashcan then joins his grandson on a nearby bench. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS274
01:05:24,00 --> 01:05:29,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE set off together side by side. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS275
01:05:27,00 --> 01:05:32,50
The grandfather pauses and turns back. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS276
01:05:30,00 --> 01:05:36,50
Now as they arrive home SOMEONE storms out and meets them on the porch. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS278
01:05:49,00 --> 01:05:55,50
Now SOMEONE finds SOMEONE dejectedly playing with Legos in his room. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS280
01:06:24,00 --> 01:06:29,50
Hit sits facing his shy grandson. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS281
01:06:46,00 --> 01:06:50,50
SOMEONE nods. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS282
01:06:54,00 --> 01:06:58,50
He produces his iPod. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS283
01:06:58,00 --> 01:07:03,50
SOMEONE sets the player in a dock. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS284
01:07:21,00 --> 01:07:27,50
SOMEONE sits in a chair and SOMEONE takes a seat on the floor. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS285
01:07:52,00 --> 01:07:56,50
SOMEONE plays the audio file. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS286
01:08:04,00 --> 01:08:10,50
As SOMEONE shuts his eyes with him, we view archived footage of the game. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS287
01:09:02,00 --> 01:09:07,50
As SOMEONE replays it, SOMEONE covers his eyes. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS288
01:09:09,00 --> 01:09:17,50
Now on a shelf. SOMEONE's bobble head wiggles near a metronome as SOMEONE practices. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS290
01:09:58,00 --> 01:10:02,50
SOMEONE shakes her head. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS291
01:10:07,00 --> 01:10:11,50
The boys sit still. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS292
01:10:24,00 --> 01:10:28,50
The boys jump up. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS293
01:10:31,00 --> 01:10:35,50
They rush on to the yard. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS294
01:10:33,00 --> 01:10:37,50
SOMEONE kicks the can. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS295
01:10:36,00 --> 01:10:47,50
SOMEONE kicks it in the air. Inside, SOMEONE turns distractedly from her violin. In the yard, SOMEONE kicks the can through SOMEONE's widespread legs. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS296
01:10:49,00 --> 01:10:55,50
Now SOMEONE runs out of the house and kicks the can away from SOMEONE. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS298
01:10:58,00 --> 01:11:05,50
SOMEONE points at her eyes, then dribbles the can through the group and deftly evades them. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS299
01:11:03,00 --> 01:11:09,50
As they play, SOMEONE kicks SOMEONE in the shin. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS301
01:11:14,00 --> 01:11:26,50
SOMEONE kicks the can high across the yard and grimaces. As SOMEONE and SOMEONE both go for the can they slip on the grass. SOMEONE grins, her clothes soaked with mud. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS302
01:11:23,00 --> 01:11:34,50
The family gleefully jumps around. SOMEONE wears a huge smile as SOMEONE drags him over the soaking lawn. SOMEONE and SOMEONE share a hug. SOMEONE grins. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS303
01:11:32,00 --> 01:11:43,50
As SOMEONE kicks at the can, he slips in the mud and knocks his wife down beside him. Smiling, they stare into each other's eyes and share a tender kiss. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS304
01:11:40,00 --> 01:11:46,50
SOMEONE belly flops on top of them, followed by SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS305
01:11:43,00 --> 01:11:49,50
As the kids climb off, SOMEONE lifts her head. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS306
01:11:46,00 --> 01:11:51,50
Blood gushes from her nose. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS307
01:11:54,00 --> 01:12:02,50
Inside, SOMEONE leaves the bathroom holding a tissue to her nose. SOMEONE approaches. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS308
01:12:30,00 --> 01:12:41,50
SOMEONE pulls SOMEONE into the bathroom. Now we soar along a sunny coastline. In a swanky bar, SOMEONE and SOMEONE smile and chat over their drinks. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS309
01:13:05,00 --> 01:13:10,50
The couple's eyes widen. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS311
01:13:22,00 --> 01:13:32,50
At home, SOMEONE searches a digital jukebox and finds The Book of Love in a playlist labeled SOMEONE's Most Played. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS312
01:13:48,00 --> 01:13:52,50
SOMEONE hugs his wife. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS313
01:14:27,00 --> 01:14:33,50
Upstairs, the boys watch their grandparents sing and dance on a video feed. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS314
01:14:39,00 --> 01:14:44,50
The boys watch from the stairs. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS315
01:15:14,00 --> 01:15:20,50
SOMEONE walks down the stairs in her new dress. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS316
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:30,50
SOMEONE snaps photos as her granddaughter shows off her curled hair. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS318
01:15:36,00 --> 01:15:42,50
SOMEONE twirls her then pulls her close for a picture. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS319
01:15:59,00 --> 01:16:04,50
SOMEONE nods and SOMEONE looks down with a smile. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS321
01:16:24,00 --> 01:16:29,50
SOMEONE races across the front lawn. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS322
01:16:29,00 --> 01:16:38,50
As SOMEONE chases him, SOMEONE steps into the street before a delivery car. The Health Tiger owner slams on his brakes. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS324
01:17:25,00 --> 01:17:30,50
SOMEONE taps SOMEONE's arm and points to a police car. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS325
01:17:28,00 --> 01:17:33,50
An officer approaches. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS326
01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:43,50
As the officer looks under the car a taxi pulls up. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS327
01:18:01,00 --> 01:18:05,50
He points to SOMEONE. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS328
01:18:06,00 --> 01:18:11,50
SOMEONE's bloody nose. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS330
01:18:34,00 --> 01:18:38,50
The officer nods. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS331
01:18:39,00 --> 01:18:46,50
SOMEONE's eyes shift to SOMEONE and SOMEONE and his mouth drops open. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS332
01:18:53,00 --> 01:18:59,50
He looks at his daughter who stares back with a disappointed gaze. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS333
01:19:07,00 --> 01:19:12,50
The officer faces The Healthy Tiger owner. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS334
01:19:13,00 --> 01:19:17,50
The family heads inside. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS335
01:19:50,00 --> 01:19:55,50
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a sidelong glance. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS337
01:20:16,00 --> 01:20:25,50
Standing beside SOMEONE, SOMEONE's gaze sinks to the ground. Inside, the couple glumly sits in the guest room. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS338
01:20:27,00 --> 01:20:32,50
Staring off, SOMEONE slowly shakes her head. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS339
01:21:27,00 --> 01:21:32,50
In the kitchen, SOMEONE sits alone with a wine glass. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS341
01:21:34,00 --> 01:21:38,50
She shakes her head. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS342
01:22:06,00 --> 01:22:10,50
SOMEONE tilts her head. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS343
01:22:28,00 --> 01:22:33,50
SOMEONE puts her head down. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS344
01:22:31,00 --> 01:22:36,50
SOMEONE stops on the stairs. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS345
01:22:40,00 --> 01:22:46,50
As SOMEONE heads upstairs, he gives SOMEONE a pat on the back. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS346
01:22:44,00 --> 01:22:50,50
SOMEONE slowly approaches SOMEONE as she takes a sip of wine. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS347
01:22:49,00 --> 01:22:53,50
He looks down. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS348
01:23:36,00 --> 01:23:41,50
He sits across from his daughter. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS349
01:23:55,00 --> 01:23:59,50
SOMEONE slowly nods. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS350
01:23:57,00 --> 01:24:02,50
SOMEONE starts to go. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS351
01:24:24,00 --> 01:24:29,50
SOMEONE lowers her gaze and shakes her head. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS352
01:24:32,00 --> 01:24:37,50
Her eyes glisten as SOMEONE sits back down. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS353
01:26:08,00 --> 01:26:12,50
She smiles. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS354
01:26:15,00 --> 01:26:20,50
She reaches for her father's hand. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS355
01:26:19,00 --> 01:26:24,50
SOMEONE stops on the staircase. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS356
01:26:31,00 --> 01:26:41,50
Now in the backyard, SOMEONE and SOMEONE carry a shoebox decorated with shiny stickers and the name SOMEONE written in green glitter paint. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS357
01:26:39,00 --> 01:26:45,50
They join the rest of the family by a hole dug in a flowerbed. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS358
01:26:42,00 --> 01:26:49,50
SOMEONE takes the box and hands it to SOMEONE, who places it in the hole. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS359
01:26:53,00 --> 01:27:01,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hand a carton of almond milk and two tofu dogs to their grieving son. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS361
01:27:00,00 --> 01:27:07,50
Grabbing the milk, SOMEONE pours it all over the box then sets on tofu dog. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS362
01:27:07,00 --> 01:27:12,50
The young boy steps back from the hole with his arms folded. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS363
01:27:25,00 --> 01:27:35,50
SOMEONE glances up and SOMEONE nods with an approving smile. Stepping beside his grandfather, SOMEONE faces the grave. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS365
01:27:38,00 --> 01:27:43,50
The Healthy Tiger owner sobs. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS383
01:28:19,00 --> 01:28:25,50
SOMEONE quickly glances down as SOMEONE grabs hold of his hand. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS384
01:28:22,00 --> 01:28:29,50
With wide eyes, he looks up at SOMEONE and SOMEONE who smile at their son's affection. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS387
01:28:32,00 --> 01:28:39,50
Stepping around the hole, SOMEONE grabs a shovel and pats the restaurant owner on the back. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS388
01:28:36,00 --> 01:28:43,50
They all watch as he throws dirt in the grave. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS391
01:29:03,00 --> 01:29:08,50
His mother eyes SOMEONE who returns the glare. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS392
01:29:05,00 --> 01:29:15,50
Leaning forward, SOMEONE scowls with a black eye. As SOMEONE leans forward, SOMEONE's sister gives a dirty look. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS395
01:29:34,00 --> 01:29:39,50
She spots SOMEONE glaring and shifts uncomfortably. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS400
01:29:50,00 --> 01:30:03,50
Backstage, parents sit in rows of elevated auditorium seats with their children waiting for the audition. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS401
01:30:00,00 --> 01:30:09,50
SOMEONE sits in the first row watching her daughter practice intensely. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS402
01:30:12,00 --> 01:30:21,50
She stares off, then glances back as SOMEONE clenches her jaw and strokes the strings with force. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS404
01:30:23,00 --> 01:30:31,50
Glaring, SOMEONE stops and watches her mother approach. She sets the violin in its case. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS420
01:31:07,00 --> 01:31:18,50
SOMEONE shakes her head. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS424
01:31:19,00 --> 01:31:33,50
Backstage, parents sit in rows of elevated auditorium seats with their children waiting for the audition. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS425
01:31:30,00 --> 01:31:38,50
SOMEONE sits in the first row watching her daughter practice intensely. 

PARENTAL_GUIDANCE_DVS426
01:31:42,00 --> 01:31:50,50
She stares off, then glances back as SOMEONE clenches her jaw and strokes the strings with force.
