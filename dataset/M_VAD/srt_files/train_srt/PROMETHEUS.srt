PROMETHEUS_DVS54
00:02:50,00 --> 00:02:57,50
An enormous saucer shaped craft hovers just above the rim of the falls. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS55
00:02:56,00 --> 00:03:03,50
The plunging water sends up pale mist that swirls around the ship. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS56
00:03:02,00 --> 00:03:10,50
From a distance we watch a cloaked, hooded figure walk over a rocky bank to the waters rim. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS57
00:03:09,00 --> 00:03:20,50
From within the hood, a stone-white human like face, with masculine features peers out through deep-set eyes, with enormous dark irises. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS58
00:03:18,00 --> 00:03:24,50
He serenely looks up at the ascending saucer-shaped craft. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS59
00:03:22,00 --> 00:03:28,50
The humanoid sets out a bowl with a heavily etched lid. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS60
00:03:25,00 --> 00:03:30,50
He doffs his cloak. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS61
00:03:27,00 --> 00:03:34,50
Revealing a pale hairless body of flawless muscle tone and proportion. Wearing only a primitive undergarment around his hips. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS63
00:03:35,00 --> 00:03:40,50
The humanoid crouches and uncaps the bowl. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS65
00:03:39,00 --> 00:03:45,50
A membrane covering a small cup disintegrates. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS66
00:03:43,00 --> 00:03:53,50
Standing, the humanoid peers into the cup and its disintegrating honeycomb-like contents. The humanoid brings the cup to his lips and drinks. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS67
00:03:52,00 --> 00:03:56,50
He watches the departing craft. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS68
00:03:55,00 --> 00:03:59,50
Still holding the cup. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS69
00:03:56,00 --> 00:04:01,50
He lurches over. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS70
00:03:59,00 --> 00:04:05,50
It drops from his grasp and plummets over the falls. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS71
00:04:03,00 --> 00:04:08,50
Large dark lesions break out all over his body. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS72
00:04:06,00 --> 00:04:13,50
One makes a seam down the side of his face and he stares at his transforming arm. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS73
00:04:11,00 --> 00:04:18,50
Our view swoops close and follows one of the lesions as it creates a trench along the limb. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS74
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:21,50
A black fluid gushes through it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS75
00:04:18,00 --> 00:04:26,50
Within, a microscopic view shows golden strands of DNA blackening, then breaking apart. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS76
00:04:24,00 --> 00:04:27,50
On the cliff. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS77
00:04:25,00 --> 00:04:31,50
The flesh between the humanoid's shoulder blades tears wide open. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS78
00:04:28,00 --> 00:04:36,50
As he leans his head back, it emits countless black particles like ash that float through the air. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS79
00:04:33,00 --> 00:04:38,50
He leans forward on one arm. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS80
00:04:35,00 --> 00:04:41,50
It snaps in two and he tumbles over the falls. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS81
00:04:39,00 --> 00:04:48,50
The swarm of black particles swirls in the air above the bank as the plunging figure vanishes into the mists. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS82
00:04:45,00 --> 00:04:54,50
Under water, the mangled body dismembers as it sinks. His neck rips apart, beheading him as he touches down. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS83
00:04:51,00 --> 00:04:58,50
Another swarm of black particles escapes his shell and swirls through the water. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS84
00:04:56,00 --> 00:05:03,50
Following them, we watch the golden DNA strands rebuild, then blacken. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS85
00:05:00,00 --> 00:05:06,50
Clean white lines appear, gradually forming letters that spell a title. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS87
00:05:05,00 --> 00:05:11,50
Now, zygotes multiply their cells. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS88
00:05:09,00 --> 00:05:13,50
Fade to black. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS89
00:05:15,00 --> 00:05:24,50
In the darkness, light streams in as a hand works bits of rock free from the other side of a wall. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS90
00:05:21,00 --> 00:05:26,50
A flashlight shines in at us through the hole. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS92
00:05:24,00 --> 00:05:30,50
A woman pulls more rock away increasing its size. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS93
00:05:28,00 --> 00:05:34,50
As she peers in, we glimpse her brown eyes and delicate features. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS94
00:05:32,00 --> 00:05:37,50
Auburn bangs peak out from under her hat. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS95
00:05:35,00 --> 00:05:42,50
Clearing away more rubble, she peers through the hole again and smiles excitedly. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS96
00:05:39,00 --> 00:05:46,50
Now, a figure moves down a steep verdant slope in the mountains. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS97
00:05:49,00 --> 00:05:56,50
Two more figures leave a cave, high behind him, as he waves his arms. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS98
00:05:53,00 --> 00:06:00,50
From a campsite, another man steps closer and lowers a scarf from his face. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS99
00:06:01,00 --> 00:06:08,50
Holloway glances back at two colleagues, then drops a pan and dashes up the slope. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS100
00:06:05,00 --> 00:06:09,50
Words appear. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS101
00:06:07,00 --> 00:06:12,50
2089, Isle of Skye, Scotland. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS102
00:06:10,00 --> 00:06:14,50
Later in the cave. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS103
00:06:11,00 --> 00:06:19,50
Holloway pulls a plastic curtain aside and his female colleague steps through with a flashlight. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS104
00:06:16,00 --> 00:06:21,50
She nimbly trots along. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS105
00:06:18,00 --> 00:06:24,50
Then lights Holloway's path as he comes in behind her. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS106
00:06:21,00 --> 00:06:28,50
He picks his way carefully over the rocky floor and joins the woman at her side. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS107
00:06:25,00 --> 00:06:30,50
She hands over her flashlight. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS108
00:06:27,00 --> 00:06:33,50
Its beam illuminates primitive cave paintings. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS109
00:06:35,00 --> 00:06:40,50
Holloway sweeps the light over the walls. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS110
00:06:39,00 --> 00:06:47,50
His colleague moves to the edge of the cavernous space, then watches him with a girlish smile. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS111
00:06:44,00 --> 00:06:54,50
He wanders closer to her. His flashlight beam revealing renderings of galloping horses and illustrations of people gathered together. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS112
00:06:52,00 --> 00:06:56,50
Holloway faces his colleague. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS113
00:06:53,00 --> 00:06:58,50
She directs the beam upward. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS114
00:06:55,00 --> 00:06:59,50
High on the wall. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS115
00:06:57,00 --> 00:07:02,50
A large human points up at six discs. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS116
00:07:01,00 --> 00:07:07,50
Holloway pulls off his fur trimmed hat. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS117
00:07:11,00 --> 00:07:17,50
Holloway's colleague smiles with tears in her eyes. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS118
00:07:14,00 --> 00:07:20,50
Her hand reaches out and interlaces with his. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS119
00:07:17,00 --> 00:07:23,50
He shines the flashlight on her pretty elfin face. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS120
00:07:20,00 --> 00:07:25,50
She faces him amazedly. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS121
00:07:22,00 --> 00:07:27,50
Then returns her gaze to the painting. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS122
00:07:27,00 --> 00:07:33,50
The flashlight beam sweeps up the pointing arm. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS123
00:07:31,00 --> 00:07:37,50
The beam lingers on the six floating discs. Fade to black. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS124
00:07:34,00 --> 00:07:41,50
As stars twinkle from within a cloudy nebula a point of light source passed. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS129
00:07:48,00 --> 00:07:52,50
A beam shines brightly from a chunky spacecraft as it turns. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS136
00:08:11,00 --> 00:08:16,50
Onboard, automated doors open to reveal a trim blond man in a gray jumpsuit.  

PROMETHEUS_DVS137
00:08:13,00 --> 00:08:19,50
Now, a monitor showing vital signs, bears the name SOMEONE. The man presses it with his finger. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS138
00:08:17,00 --> 00:08:22,50
Wearing a helmet with a glowing amber visor over his eyes. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS139
00:08:19,00 --> 00:08:25,50
He touches a long casket like pod. It's clouded glass clears revealing Holloway's colleague. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS140
00:08:22,00 --> 00:08:28,50
Clad in bandage-like undergarments, she appears to sleep. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS141
00:08:25,00 --> 00:08:35,50
Using a touch screen built into the glass, the man accesses an amber-hued memory of a little girl watching men carry a body on a litter. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS142
00:08:49,00 --> 00:08:53,50
Her father prepares a meal. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS143
00:08:57,00 --> 00:09:02,50
A woman's image appears then vanishes. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS144
00:09:06,00 --> 00:09:10,50
He wears a cross. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS145
00:09:16,00 --> 00:09:21,50
An image shows his hand laying the cross in hers. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS146
00:09:21,00 --> 00:09:26,50
The young SOMEONE regards the local priest. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS147
00:09:23,00 --> 00:09:29,50
The trim man appears at the vision's center. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS148
00:09:26,00 --> 00:09:33,50
As the transmission ends, the man lingers with his hand on the touch screen, then steps away. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS149
00:09:31,00 --> 00:09:37,50
Now he touches a panel and doors open before him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS151
00:09:36,00 --> 00:09:41,50
Holding a basketball in one hand, he strides through the ships chambers. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS152
00:09:38,00 --> 00:09:44,50
Lights turn on as he passes, then blink out again. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS153
00:09:42,00 --> 00:09:49,50
Pausing by a table, he crouches and picks something up off the spotless floor. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS155
00:09:47,00 --> 00:09:51,50
Moving on, he bounces the ball. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS157
00:09:50,00 --> 00:09:56,50
In a cockpit, he activates a computer with a three-dimensional holographic screen. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS158
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:06,50
A screen at the top shows a girl playing a violin. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS159
00:10:05,00 --> 00:10:13,50
Now, on a basketball court with a row of treadmills at one end, SOMEONE rides a bicycle in circles. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS160
00:10:11,00 --> 00:10:17,50
He shoots the basketball from the bike and it goes through the basket. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS161
00:10:19,00 --> 00:10:25,50
Now SOMEONE eats a bowl of white mush with a spoon. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS162
00:10:22,00 --> 00:10:28,50
His attention fixed on a holographic video before him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS163
00:10:31,00 --> 00:10:38,50
At another time, he bounces his basketball as he walks the ships corridors. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS165
00:10:44,00 --> 00:10:48,50
A movie plays. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS166
00:10:50,00 --> 00:10:59,50
As T.E. Lawrence, Peter O'Toole extinguishes a match with his fingertips, silhouetted against the screen, SOMEONE watches. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS167
00:11:05,00 --> 00:11:12,50
Hair dye plasters his roots. At a mirror, SOMEONE styles his dry hair. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS168
00:11:26,00 --> 00:11:34,50
SOMEONE combs his golden hair to match Peter O'Toole's style. Later, he moves through a dark corridor. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS169
00:11:40,00 --> 00:11:45,50
SOMEONE halts, wavering unsteadily. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS170
00:11:43,00 --> 00:11:52,50
Quickly regaining his balance, he observes racked silver billiard balls and a cue rolling across a blue felt table. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS171
00:11:49,00 --> 00:11:55,50
Frowning, SOMEONE moves to a panel and types. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS172
00:11:55,00 --> 00:12:02,50
Lights blink on and off throughout the corridors as he returns to the cockpit. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS173
00:12:02,00 --> 00:12:09,50
He flips switches activating lights and computers across the bridge. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS174
00:12:06,00 --> 00:12:14,50
Holographic screens blink on above the front stations, each offering individualized data. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS175
00:12:12,00 --> 00:12:17,50
SOMEONE strides to one and pushes a button. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS176
00:12:14,00 --> 00:12:24,50
From the nose, outer panels part giving view through the glass windows to a pale gray planet floating amidst a sea of stars. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS177
00:12:21,00 --> 00:12:26,50
SOMEONE steps forward. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS178
00:12:23,00 --> 00:12:28,50
His eager gaze fixed on the lonely orb. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS179
00:12:28,00 --> 00:12:33,50
His deep-set blue eyes shine wistfully. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS181
00:12:32,00 --> 00:12:39,50
near an enormous ringed planet, the stocky insect shaped SOMEONE turns. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS183
00:12:41,00 --> 00:12:45,50
SOMEONE opens a pair of doors. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS184
00:12:43,00 --> 00:12:48,50
Looking down, he cocks his head and frowns. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS185
00:12:45,00 --> 00:12:50,50
A sleeper pod lies open and empty. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS186
00:12:48,00 --> 00:12:55,50
He follows wet prints of bare feet down a corridor's black rubber floor. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS187
00:12:55,00 --> 00:13:05,50
On illuminated floor panels, a soaking wet woman clad in bandage-like undergarments does push-ups with a determined stare. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS188
00:13:02,00 --> 00:13:07,50
SOMEONE arrives outside her door. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS189
00:13:05,00 --> 00:13:12,50
SOMEONE fully parts that partially open doors and steps into the chamber. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS190
00:13:10,00 --> 00:13:17,50
The lean woman's long blond hair drips around her face as she completes her routine. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS191
00:13:14,00 --> 00:13:19,50
SOMEONE presents her with a robe. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS192
00:13:18,00 --> 00:13:22,50
She puts it on. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS193
00:13:29,00 --> 00:13:34,50
She takes clothes from a rack. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS194
00:13:33,00 --> 00:13:40,50
Now, back in the groups sleep chamber, SOMEONE moves among the opening pods. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS196
00:13:38,00 --> 00:13:44,50
fluid streams from SOMEONE's bare feet as they dangle from her pod. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS197
00:13:46,00 --> 00:13:50,50
She vomits into a bowl. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS198
00:13:49,00 --> 00:13:53,50
He lays a blanket over her back. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS199
00:14:02,00 --> 00:14:08,50
Sitting near by, Holloway drinks fluids. SOMEONE vomits again. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS200
00:14:06,00 --> 00:14:10,50
Now in a mess hall. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS201
00:14:10,00 --> 00:14:18,50
In flight suits and hoodies, SOMEONE, Holloway, and rag-tag crew members get food and beverages. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS202
00:14:16,00 --> 00:14:21,50
In a sleek, high-collared suit, the blond arrives. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS203
00:14:22,00 --> 00:14:29,50
She spies a brawny charming man setting up a small Christmas tree on the pool table. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS204
00:14:29,00 --> 00:14:34,50
He takes a small cigar from his mouth. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS205
00:14:43,00 --> 00:14:47,50
A mohawked man sips broth. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS206
00:14:45,00 --> 00:14:49,50
A bespectacled man sits. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS207
00:14:49,00 --> 00:14:54,50
He extends a hand, the mohawked man glares. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS208
00:15:05,00 --> 00:15:11,50
SOMEONE gives an intimidated nod then smiles. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS210
00:15:19,00 --> 00:15:26,50
The rest of the crew joins the pair in a briefing area set on the basketball court. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS211
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:52,50
Sitting at the front, SOMEONE uses a tablet to activate a huge 3-D holographic video. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS212
00:15:54,00 --> 00:15:58,50
A little dog accompanies an old man. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS213
00:15:57,00 --> 00:16:02,50
A living area appears before him as he advances. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS214
00:16:42,00 --> 00:16:47,50
SOMEONE's smile fades. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS215
00:17:02,00 --> 00:17:06,50
They both comply. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS216
00:17:23,00 --> 00:17:29,50
SOMEONE and Holloway go to either side of the holographic speaker. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS217
00:17:28,00 --> 00:17:35,50
As Weyland turns and walks away, his surroundings blink out. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS218
00:17:32,00 --> 00:17:38,50
The holographic man vanishes, ending the playback. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS219
00:17:42,00 --> 00:17:46,50
He shows a silver cube. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS220
00:17:48,00 --> 00:17:55,50
Holloway presses a few squares that make up the cube and it projects a series of images. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS221
00:18:21,00 --> 00:18:27,50
He lines up the images to show overlapping patterns. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS222
00:18:36,00 --> 00:18:40,50
He sets the discs in a map. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS223
00:18:48,00 --> 00:18:53,50
He zooms the map in. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS224
00:18:58,00 --> 00:19:03,50
He shows the ringed planet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS225
00:19:04,00 --> 00:19:09,50
The gray sphere orbits it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS226
00:19:08,00 --> 00:19:13,50
The mohawked crewman gives a nod. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS227
00:19:15,00 --> 00:19:20,50
SOMEONE grins. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS228
00:19:18,00 --> 00:19:22,50
Holloway nods to SOMEONE. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS229
00:19:37,00 --> 00:19:43,50
The mohawked crewman lays his face in his hands. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS230
00:19:41,00 --> 00:19:46,50
SOMEONE laughs then speaks up. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS231
00:20:01,00 --> 00:20:08,50
SOMEONE regards SOMEONE attentively, then lowers his contemplative gaze. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS232
00:20:05,00 --> 00:20:13,50
Now, blue flame glows within the Prometheus' jets as it nears the mysterious moon. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS233
00:20:12,00 --> 00:20:16,50
It spirals around. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS234
00:20:13,00 --> 00:20:19,50
Bringing its angle parallel with the moon's curve. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS235
00:20:17,00 --> 00:20:25,50
The sun casts a thin crest of illumination across the pale blue and gray surface. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS236
00:20:25,00 --> 00:20:30,50
In a corridor, SOMEONE walks ahead of Holloway. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS237
00:20:30,00 --> 00:20:34,50
SOMEONE smiles at them. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS238
00:20:36,00 --> 00:20:41,50
He escorts them into a luxurious living environment. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS239
00:20:39,00 --> 00:20:44,50
Windows give the illusion of a peaceful winter scene. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS240
00:21:06,00 --> 00:21:10,50
SOMEONE steps away. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS241
00:21:26,00 --> 00:21:30,50
SOMEONE rejoins the group. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS242
00:21:52,00 --> 00:21:57,50
At a bar, SOMEONE uses a cocktail shaker. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS243
00:22:09,00 --> 00:22:14,50
The windows show a field. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS244
00:22:14,00 --> 00:22:19,50
SOMEONE serves the drinks. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS245
00:22:26,00 --> 00:22:32,50
SOMEONE stares and Holloway smiles bitterly. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS246
00:22:30,00 --> 00:22:37,50
Now, multiple screens show data and imagery over SOMEONE's computer. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS247
00:23:00,00 --> 00:23:06,50
Turning his computer off, SOMEONE smiles and turns away. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS248
00:23:25,00 --> 00:23:30,50
The crew straps themselves in. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS249
00:23:27,00 --> 00:23:35,50
SOMEONE puts up his hood and hugs his jacket closed. The ship descends towards clouds. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS250
00:23:50,00 --> 00:23:56,50
The small stout SOMEONE descends through a fierce storm. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS251
00:24:03,00 --> 00:24:08,50
Lightning flashes around the ship. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS252
00:24:11,00 --> 00:24:18,50
They pass jagged mountains peeking from thick mist as the sun shines through the clouds. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS253
00:24:16,00 --> 00:24:22,50
Fog parts, revealing a barren valley dotted with low hills. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS254
00:24:20,00 --> 00:24:27,50
Another field shows swirling patterns, indicating previous lava flow. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS255
00:24:24,00 --> 00:24:30,50
A dome shaped formation juts from a range of hills. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS256
00:24:27,00 --> 00:24:35,50
We gaze down on the SOMEONE as it progresses past jagged blades of rock. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS257
00:24:42,00 --> 00:24:47,50
SOMEONE faces the Scottish woman. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS258
00:24:45,00 --> 00:24:49,50
He gives a smile. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS259
00:24:47,00 --> 00:24:53,50
Now, we soar through a barren, unforgiving mountain range. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS260
00:24:54,00 --> 00:25:01,50
The ship slows as it approaches a gap between two outcroppings. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS261
00:25:01,00 --> 00:25:09,50
Holloway eyes a display monitor. It shows a structure peeking out from behind a mountain. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS262
00:25:11,00 --> 00:25:14,50
He gets up. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS263
00:25:14,00 --> 00:25:18,50
He peers out a window. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS264
00:25:28,00 --> 00:25:35,50
Clearing the gateway, the ship turns towards a low structure built in the distant valley. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS265
00:25:43,00 --> 00:25:49,50
The ship's jets rotate downward. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS266
00:25:50,00 --> 00:25:55,50
They slow the ships descent to a controlled pace. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS267
00:25:55,00 --> 00:26:02,50
The jets bring up massive clouds of dust around the ship as it touches down. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS268
00:25:59,00 --> 00:26:06,50
Overhead, the enormous ringed planet glows softly beside the sun. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS270
00:26:05,00 --> 00:26:13,50
Domes resembling the tops of beehives surrounded by stone walls dot the valley in single file. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS271
00:26:10,00 --> 00:26:15,50
Roughly a mile apart from each other. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS272
00:26:14,00 --> 00:26:22,50
On board SOMEONE, Holloway rushes to the front windows, while SOMEONE follows warily. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS273
00:26:20,00 --> 00:26:26,50
Other members of the crew move forward, staring out. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS274
00:26:26,00 --> 00:26:30,50
Holloway kisses SOMEONE's head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS275
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:52,50
Now the survey team suits up. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS276
00:26:49,00 --> 00:26:57,50
Beneath their clear helmets, skullcaps bear their names. The Scottish woman bears the name SOMEONE. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS277
00:26:54,00 --> 00:27:00,50
SOMEONE notices a crewmen wielding a flame-thrower. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS278
00:27:13,00 --> 00:27:18,50
In a suit, Holloway presses buttons on his sleeve. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS279
00:27:43,00 --> 00:27:49,50
A large boxy chamber descends from the ships underside. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS280
00:27:46,00 --> 00:27:53,50
In the airlock, a hatch rises. The crew steps into a hanger. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS281
00:27:54,00 --> 00:28:01,50
SOMEONE brings a duffel to the front of a transport vehicle with twin rows of seats. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS282
00:28:04,00 --> 00:28:11,50
As the mohawked man sits, SOMEONE takes the seat facing him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS283
00:28:08,00 --> 00:28:14,50
The mohawked man moves down a few spots. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS284
00:28:11,00 --> 00:28:16,50
The hanger hatch lowers making an exit ramp. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS285
00:28:14,00 --> 00:28:20,50
The transport pulls out alongside two ATVs. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS286
00:28:17,00 --> 00:28:23,50
In the transport, Holloway moves close to SOMEONE. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS287
00:28:28,00 --> 00:28:32,50
Holloway chuckles. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS288
00:28:30,00 --> 00:28:36,50
He presses her helmet to his with an ardent gaze, then turns away. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS289
00:28:37,00 --> 00:28:42,50
SOMEONE adverts her troubled gaze. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS290
00:28:39,00 --> 00:28:47,50
The transport leads the two ATVs to an opening in a wall surrounding the structure. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS291
00:28:44,00 --> 00:28:49,50
A sharp crust tops the beehive like doom. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS292
00:28:56,00 --> 00:29:05,50
Holloway and SOMEONE come forward, crowding the front of the cabin with SOMEONE as they stare out the windshield. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS293
00:29:02,00 --> 00:29:09,50
The crust rounded front gives a hint of wind-eroded carving of a face. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS294
00:29:07,00 --> 00:29:12,50
The survey vehicles pull up around the dome and park. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS295
00:29:10,00 --> 00:29:17,50
A side hatch in the transport rises and SOMEONE leads the others out. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS296
00:29:14,00 --> 00:29:22,50
Her helmet's computerized view shows long, low entrances carved into the dome's base. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS297
00:29:27,00 --> 00:29:34,50
In the dark cockpit, SOMEONE stands behind the captain's chair. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS298
00:29:31,00 --> 00:29:38,50
The other survey team members leave the ATVs staring up. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS299
00:29:37,00 --> 00:29:43,50
Holloway ventures forward and SOMEONE follows. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS300
00:29:41,00 --> 00:29:49,50
The team members approach one of the entry ways, each carrying a kit or bag of varying size. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS302
00:29:48,00 --> 00:29:55,50
We peer up at the approaching humans from a sandy slope dotted with sharp rocks. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS303
00:29:53,00 --> 00:29:58,50
Crossing the threshold, they head down the slope. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS304
00:29:55,00 --> 00:30:01,50
SOMEONE regards the space with a calm expression. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS305
00:29:58,00 --> 00:30:05,50
A view through a helmet camera shows a few of the team exploring the cavernous space. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS306
00:30:03,00 --> 00:30:09,50
Various readings border the image along with the user's name, SOMEONE. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS307
00:30:07,00 --> 00:30:13,50
Now, Holloway's view closes in on a cave opening. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS308
00:30:19,00 --> 00:30:28,50
As the team ventures in, holographic monitors each show the captain a crew member's computerized helmet view. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS309
00:30:25,00 --> 00:30:30,50
Venturing through the opening. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS310
00:30:27,00 --> 00:30:32,50
SOMEONE draws himself up with an alert stare. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS311
00:30:30,00 --> 00:30:34,50
SOMEONE follows. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS312
00:30:32,00 --> 00:30:40,50
On the other side, SOMEONE and the mohawked man linger, sharing an uneasy gaze. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS313
00:30:37,00 --> 00:30:42,50
SOMEONE ducks through first. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS314
00:30:39,00 --> 00:30:44,50
The other man glances fearfully over his shoulder. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS316
00:30:43,00 --> 00:30:48,50
Further in, the team passes through a circular archway 

PROMETHEUS_DVS317
00:30:46,00 --> 00:30:51,50
and enters a tunnel perpendicular to their path. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS318
00:30:49,00 --> 00:30:55,50
They pause, shining their lights in either direction. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS319
00:31:01,00 --> 00:31:05,50
The mohawked man readies orbs. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS320
00:31:10,00 --> 00:31:20,50
SOMEONE releases two into the air. Spinning, they shine red scanner beams in all directions as they fly down the corridor. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS321
00:31:17,00 --> 00:31:22,50
He sends two more off the other way. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS322
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:33,50
The last scanning pup vanishes around a turn. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS324
00:31:32,00 --> 00:31:38,50
Leaving his chair the captain goes to a layout table. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS326
00:31:38,00 --> 00:31:43,50
As he activates its computerized system, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE join him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS328
00:31:42,00 --> 00:31:47,50
In the 3-D holograph flying red beacons map out a tunnel system. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS329
00:31:46,00 --> 00:31:58,50
Yellow beacons marked with surname initials SOMEONE the team member's locations. The pups split off again as the extending network of tunnels grows more complex. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS331
00:31:56,00 --> 00:32:02,50
The survey team reaches a rounded tunnel of dark gleaming stone. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS332
00:32:07,00 --> 00:32:15,50
As he leads them on, SOMEONE curiously shines her flashlight at the etched stone walls. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS333
00:32:12,00 --> 00:32:18,50
SOMEONE takes up the rear, closely observing his surroundings. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS334
00:32:15,00 --> 00:32:21,50
They venture towards a faint light in the distance. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS335
00:32:18,00 --> 00:32:24,50
Now, beams of light sweep erratically over rock. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS336
00:32:21,00 --> 00:32:27,50
Rounding a turn, the survey team steps into view and slows. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS337
00:32:27,00 --> 00:32:34,50
The stand in a chamber where water streams to around pit at its center. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS338
00:32:31,00 --> 00:32:37,50
A pup doubles back from the far wall and drops down the pit. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS339
00:32:36,00 --> 00:32:42,50
Water rains around the probe as it plunges several stories. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS340
00:32:53,00 --> 00:32:58,50
Holloway taps keys on his sleeve. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS341
00:33:17,00 --> 00:33:26,50
Holloway unlatches his helmet then bends over and pulls it off. Straightening he inhales deeply and pulls off his skullcap. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS342
00:33:24,00 --> 00:33:28,50
His breath clouds the air. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS343
00:33:35,00 --> 00:33:39,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS344
00:33:37,00 --> 00:33:43,50
Glaring scoldingly at Holloway, SOMEONE removes her helmet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS345
00:33:49,00 --> 00:33:52,50
In the cockpit. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS346
00:34:10,00 --> 00:34:16,50
The away team moves through a dark space. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS347
00:34:28,00 --> 00:34:34,50
Hiking a tunnel, they sweep flashlights over their surroundings. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS348
00:34:34,00 --> 00:34:42,50
Trailing behind, SOMEONE spots a panel with carved dots and lines high up on the wall. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS350
00:34:41,00 --> 00:34:47,50
Climbing up, he notices greenish slime dripping from a few of the engraved points. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS351
00:34:44,00 --> 00:34:50,50
SOMEONE collects some on his gloved fingertip, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS352
00:34:47,00 --> 00:34:51,50
then presses it to his thumb. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS353
00:34:49,00 --> 00:34:55,50
As they part, the slime stretches between his fingertips. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS354
00:34:52,00 --> 00:34:58,50
Glowing blue particles swarm within. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS355
00:34:55,00 --> 00:34:59,50
SOMEONE sniffs it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS356
00:34:58,00 --> 00:35:04,50
Unnoticing the others venture ahead without him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS357
00:35:01,00 --> 00:35:08,50
SOMEONE runs his finger along a few of the lines and presses the engraved dots. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS358
00:35:05,00 --> 00:35:10,50
They light up beneath his touch. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS359
00:35:07,00 --> 00:35:14,50
A screen of glowing blue particles forms and races down the tunnel. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS360
00:35:13,00 --> 00:35:18,50
Pausing, the human team members turn. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS361
00:35:25,00 --> 00:35:29,50
He stares at an approaching light. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS362
00:35:28,00 --> 00:35:35,50
Glowing blue particles form several giant humanoids racing down the tunnel. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS363
00:35:32,00 --> 00:35:38,50
As SOMEONE remains in their path, they wash over him like wind. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS364
00:35:37,00 --> 00:35:45,50
Holloway sweeps SOMEONE out of their way. The incorporeal figures continue down the tunnel. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS365
00:35:50,00 --> 00:35:55,50
The team runs after the giant ghostly figures. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS366
00:35:54,00 --> 00:36:03,50
Lagging behind the others, a lone apparition stumbles and falls. It gets up and runs on as those ahead dart out of view. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS367
00:36:02,00 --> 00:36:11,50
Holloway and SOMEONE arrive in time to watch it collapse at a doorway. It's ghostly hatch lowers on top of him and he vanishes. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS368
00:36:08,00 --> 00:36:16,50
Staying SOMEONE with a hand, Holloway ventures forward. The others arrive behind him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS369
00:36:17,00 --> 00:36:21,50
A body lies at the door. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS370
00:36:22,00 --> 00:36:26,50
The team approaches it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS372
00:36:43,00 --> 00:36:50,50
At the door, Holloway and SOMEONE spy ancient text carved into the stone. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS373
00:36:52,00 --> 00:36:58,50
The strange characters fill several rows. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS374
00:36:57,00 --> 00:37:01,50
SOMEONE starts to leave. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS375
00:37:03,00 --> 00:37:07,50
He marches back indignantly. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS376
00:37:46,00 --> 00:37:52,50
Leaning close to SOMEONE, SOMEONE wheels around and leaves with SOMEONE. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS377
00:37:54,00 --> 00:38:01,50
Now, as Holloway, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE examine the decapitated body, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS378
00:37:58,00 --> 00:38:02,50
SOMEONE climbs a ladder. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS379
00:38:02,00 --> 00:38:08,50
Holloway hands over a flashlight sized device. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS380
00:38:05,00 --> 00:38:14,50
As SOMEONE studies the carved symbols in the wall, SOMEONE inserts a probe from the carbon reader into the alien being. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS381
00:38:18,00 --> 00:38:24,50
SOMEONE taps the symbols, which light up briefly with his touch. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS382
00:38:33,00 --> 00:38:40,50
As a pup moves in to scan the revealed chamber, SOMEONE kneels just on the other side of the door. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS383
00:38:39,00 --> 00:38:47,50
Her flashlight beam reveals a head, three times the size of a human's with a short elephant like trunk. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS384
00:38:44,00 --> 00:38:51,50
Holloway moves further inside transfixed by an enormous humanoid bust. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS385
00:38:55,00 --> 00:39:00,50
SOMEONE steps further in, studying the sculpted face. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS387
00:39:02,00 --> 00:39:08,50
the sculpture towers over hundreds of sleek gray thigh high urns. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS388
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:11,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE follow the others into the room. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS389
00:39:08,00 --> 00:39:16,50
One of their boots lifts from the soft dirt revealing worms wriggling about. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS390
00:39:13,00 --> 00:39:19,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE aim their flashlights at the curved ceiling. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS391
00:39:22,00 --> 00:39:28,50
Holloway moves deeper in through the evenly spaced urns. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS392
00:39:26,00 --> 00:39:32,50
SOMEONE crouches down for a better look at one and reaches out to it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS393
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:50,50
Condensation beads on its flat topped metallic surface. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS394
00:39:47,00 --> 00:39:53,50
As SOMEONE gazes slack-jawed at the humanoid statue. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS395
00:39:50,00 --> 00:39:56,50
Holloway continues on around to a recess behind it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS396
00:39:54,00 --> 00:40:01,50
A relief of snake-like creatures surrounding a central humanoid figure adorns the wall. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS397
00:39:59,00 --> 00:40:04,50
As Holloway steps around a large pedestal, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS398
00:40:02,00 --> 00:40:09,50
his flashlight beam shines through a huge emerald-like stone jutting from its center. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS399
00:40:07,00 --> 00:40:11,50
SOMEONE kneels at another urn. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS400
00:40:09,00 --> 00:40:15,50
A tar-like substance oozes on top. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS401
00:40:12,00 --> 00:40:21,50
The android tilts his head curiously and touches some spilling down the side with a gloved finger. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS402
00:40:23,00 --> 00:40:29,50
SOMEONE moves her flashlight beam across the high ceiling. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS403
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:30,50
The painting changes. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS404
00:40:42,00 --> 00:40:47,50
The woman rushed back to the severed head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS405
00:40:45,00 --> 00:40:51,50
On the surface, storm clouds swirl menacingly in the sky. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS406
00:40:49,00 --> 00:40:56,50
On board SOMEONE, SOMEONE studies images of the storm on a monitor. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS407
00:41:03,00 --> 00:41:09,50
In the chamber, SOMEONE and SOMEONE lift the head into a plastic bag. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS408
00:41:26,00 --> 00:41:31,50
SOMEONE turns to watch SOMEONE leave the bridge. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS409
00:41:36,00 --> 00:41:43,50
Kneeling at a clean urn, SOMEONE sprays it with a gaseous substance from a small canister. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS410
00:41:41,00 --> 00:41:47,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hoist the head up between them. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS412
00:41:48,00 --> 00:41:56,50
Holloway leaves the carved relief in the wall. SOMEONE surreptitiously packs the urn in a canvas bag. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS413
00:41:56,00 --> 00:42:02,50
As he walks away the black ooze pools around the urn. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS414
00:41:59,00 --> 00:42:04,50
The worms wriggle in it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS415
00:42:01,00 --> 00:42:08,50
Outside the dome the four researchers find only the ATVs. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS416
00:42:10,00 --> 00:42:15,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE get in one. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS417
00:42:16,00 --> 00:42:22,50
Holloway drives off with SOMEONE on the second ATV. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS418
00:42:19,00 --> 00:42:29,50
A dark shadow passes over them. Above, thick black clouds engulf the dome and the enormous carved skull on its crest. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS419
00:42:26,00 --> 00:42:34,50
On the road leading towards SOMEONE, the ATVs travel in the dusty wake of a transport. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS420
00:42:33,00 --> 00:42:42,50
As the storm engulfs us, jagged shards whip around then block out our view of the fleeing vehicles. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS421
00:42:39,00 --> 00:42:50,50
From a long distance, the storm appears as a swiftly moving wall of roiling dirt. On SOMEONE, SOMEONE watches the approaching vehicles and storm. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS422
00:42:49,00 --> 00:42:58,50
The transport makes it into the hanger. As the ATVs speed in, one hits a bump and the bagged head falls off. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS423
00:42:59,00 --> 00:43:03,50
SOMEONE races after it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS424
00:43:01,00 --> 00:43:11,50
As SOMEONE grabs it, the silica storm knocks her 50 yards into one of the ships towering landing struts. Holloway takes an ATV. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS425
00:43:14,00 --> 00:43:19,50
On the screen SOMEONE watches Holloway leave the ship. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS426
00:43:17,00 --> 00:43:22,50
The hatch closes, Holloway reaches SOMEONE. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS427
00:43:21,00 --> 00:43:27,50
As Holloway climbs out of the vehicle, it blows away. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS428
00:43:28,00 --> 00:43:33,50
The ATV tumbles through the storm. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS429
00:43:32,00 --> 00:43:39,50
As they take each other's hands amid the whirling shards, an outer door opens on the ship. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS430
00:43:36,00 --> 00:43:44,50
SOMEONE clips himself to a cable attached to SOMEONE. Meanwhile the storm lifts SOMEONE. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS431
00:43:46,00 --> 00:44:00,50
Holloway struggles to keep a hold on her. As SOMEONE steps out, the storm bounces him around. He makes it over to Holloway and helps him pull SOMEONE back into a recess made by the forked landing strut. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS432
00:44:00,00 --> 00:44:08,50
The android calmly clips the humans to his line and gives SOMEONE the okay hand signal. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS433
00:44:06,00 --> 00:44:13,50
He lifts a remote control and the line pulls them back towards the open door in the ship. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS434
00:44:12,00 --> 00:44:23,50
The clustered trio bobs and bounces as the line carries them through the harsh wind and flying shards. A crew member helps pull them on board. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS436
00:44:26,00 --> 00:44:33,50
Later as they move through the hanger, a crew member blasts the floor with a flame thrower. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS438
00:44:57,00 --> 00:45:02,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk through a dark tunnel. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS439
00:45:43,00 --> 00:45:59,50
The two trapped men move on through the dark cramped space. Meanwhile, in a lab on board SOMEONE, the head SOMEONE collected rises into a glass chamber. A white mist blasts it, filling the chamber and an image appears on a monitor. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS440
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:07,50
As the head slides from the chamber, SOMEONE arrives. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS441
00:46:18,00 --> 00:46:24,50
SOMEONE activates an arched scanner that glides over the head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS442
00:46:28,00 --> 00:46:35,50
As SOMEONE studies one monitor, SOMEONE steps over the image of the head on another. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS443
00:46:44,00 --> 00:46:49,50
As Holloway plops down nearby with a bottle of liquor, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS444
00:46:47,00 --> 00:46:53,50
SOMEONE easily releases the helmet, lifting the trunk like snout. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS445
00:46:54,00 --> 00:47:01,50
Carefully lifting the large helmet off completely, he reveals a human-like head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS446
00:46:59,00 --> 00:47:03,50
It's eyes closed peacefully. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS447
00:47:01,00 --> 00:47:07,50
Scaly patches and bumps mar the gray skin on its bald head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS449
00:47:06,00 --> 00:47:11,50
As the others stare, SOMEONE and SOMEONE look more closely. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS450
00:47:24,00 --> 00:47:29,50
SOMEONE activates a probe. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS451
00:47:34,00 --> 00:47:42,50
She inserts it behind the engineer's ear, taps a few commands on a tablet, and waits. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS452
00:47:46,00 --> 00:47:53,50
Holloway lowers his drink as the cells on the engineer's head change. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS453
00:47:53,00 --> 00:47:59,50
The engineer's eyes twitch and open slightly. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS454
00:48:02,00 --> 00:48:10,50
Dark fluid oozes from small holes on either side of his brow and he grimaces painfully. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS455
00:48:14,00 --> 00:48:21,50
As SOMEONE activates a conveyor belt, carrying the head back to the containment chamber, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS456
00:48:18,00 --> 00:48:27,50
the engineer's face grimaces and winces. The chamber door slides shut and another shot of white mist blast it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS457
00:48:24,00 --> 00:48:33,50
As the mist clears, the top of the head explodes, splattering the chamber walls with a greenish slime. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS458
00:48:30,00 --> 00:48:36,50
SOMEONE lowers her white doctor's mask, SOMEONE stares. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS459
00:48:36,00 --> 00:48:43,50
Holloway takes a swig from a bottle and hops down his perch on a counter. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS460
00:48:40,00 --> 00:48:46,50
SOMEONE glances after him then lowers her gaze. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS461
00:48:47,00 --> 00:48:55,50
Later, the storm continues to pelt SOMEONE. Inside SOMEONE stands by a sleep pod. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS462
00:48:57,00 --> 00:49:01,50
He wears the helmet with the glowing visor. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS463
00:49:00,00 --> 00:49:05,50
He allows a slight smile and bows his head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS464
00:49:06,00 --> 00:49:11,50
Stepping over to the head of the sleep pod, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS465
00:49:08,00 --> 00:49:15,50
SOMEONE touches his palm to its top and a light glowing within dims. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS466
00:49:15,00 --> 00:49:22,50
He removes his helmet and amber visor, revealing his stoic expression. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS467
00:49:23,00 --> 00:49:28,50
Now, as he strides down a corridor, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS468
00:49:26,00 --> 00:49:31,50
he removes gloves and tosses them into a bin. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS470
00:49:30,00 --> 00:49:35,50
Rounding a bend, He finds SOMEONE waiting for him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS471
00:49:32,00 --> 00:49:37,50
She steps before him and he slows to a stop. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS472
00:49:36,00 --> 00:49:42,50
She steps closer, fixing him with a piercing stare. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS473
00:49:44,00 --> 00:49:50,50
As SOMEONE tries to side step around her, she blocks him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS474
00:49:47,00 --> 00:49:53,50
They stare at each other only a few inches apart. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS475
00:49:55,00 --> 00:50:00,50
She pins him to a wall. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS476
00:50:15,00 --> 00:50:24,50
Tensing her jaw, SOMEONE takes a deep breath through her nose and moves her hand towards SOMEONE's mouth as if to smother him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS477
00:50:22,00 --> 00:50:26,50
She storms away. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS479
00:50:24,00 --> 00:50:31,50
SOMEONE approaches a wall of glass-doored coolers filled with supplies. Opening one, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS480
00:50:28,00 --> 00:50:34,50
he removes the urn he took from the inner chamber. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS482
00:50:37,00 --> 00:50:41,50
In the lab, SOMEONE peers through a microscope. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS483
00:50:39,00 --> 00:50:45,50
In the other lab, SOMEONE gently twists the top off the urn and sets it aside. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS485
00:50:48,00 --> 00:50:53,50
Meanwhile, with SOMEONE, a green laser beam aims at a slide. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS486
00:50:58,00 --> 00:51:06,50
On screen, a map of the engineer's DNA overlaps a human sample. The scientist's jaws drop. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS487
00:51:08,00 --> 00:51:14,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE lifts a rack of four large vials from the urn. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS488
00:51:12,00 --> 00:51:18,50
Gray ooze drips off the container as he sets it down on a work surface. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS489
00:51:16,00 --> 00:51:22,50
The android breaks off one of the translucent, foot long vials. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS490
00:51:19,00 --> 00:51:24,50
As he tips it upside down 

PROMETHEUS_DVS491
00:51:21,00 --> 00:51:26,50
black matter collected at the bottom drips downward. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS492
00:51:24,00 --> 00:51:29,50
In the lab, SOMEONE peers at the monitor. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS493
00:51:37,00 --> 00:51:42,50
Now SOMEONE breaks off the tip of the vial. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS494
00:51:39,00 --> 00:51:46,50
Putting his fingertip over the resulting hole, he tips it upside down. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS495
00:51:43,00 --> 00:51:50,50
A tiny drop of the black matter sits on the tip of his index finger. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS496
00:51:47,00 --> 00:51:53,50
He lifts it to eye level and peers closely at it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS497
00:51:57,00 --> 00:52:01,50
He smiles. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS498
00:51:59,00 --> 00:52:08,50
Now, SOMEONE enters the mess hall with a bottle of liquor and sees Holloway drunkenly fiddling with balls on the pool table. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS499
00:52:11,00 --> 00:52:18,50
The android lifts a glass off a shelf with his thumb and middle finger, leaving his index finger extended. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS500
00:52:23,00 --> 00:52:27,50
Holloway rolls a ball toward him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS501
00:52:32,00 --> 00:52:36,50
Holloway shoves back his hood. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS502
00:52:59,00 --> 00:53:04,50
SOMEONE stares grimly at Holloway. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS503
00:53:06,00 --> 00:53:10,50
Holloway smiles up at him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS504
00:53:36,00 --> 00:53:42,50
Keeping his index finger extended, SOMEONE pours a glass of liquor. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS505
00:53:40,00 --> 00:53:46,50
As he hands it over to Holloway, he dips his index finger in it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS506
00:53:44,00 --> 00:53:48,50
Holloway takes it with a grin. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS507
00:53:49,00 --> 00:53:54,50
He takes a sip, then knocks the whole thing back. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS508
00:53:52,00 --> 00:53:56,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS509
00:53:55,00 --> 00:54:02,50
Meanwhile, in the tunnels, SOMEONE and SOMEONE come upon a pile of corpses. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS510
00:54:01,00 --> 00:54:07,50
Their flashlights illuminate the mangled mass over 10 feet tall. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS511
00:54:34,00 --> 00:54:45,50
Meanwhile, on the bridge, the holographic map shows the pups still tracing out tunnels and chambers and SOMEONE's and SOMEONE's location within. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS512
00:54:42,00 --> 00:54:49,50
SOMEONE stops playing a concertina and approaches a pinging red dot on the map. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS513
00:54:48,00 --> 00:54:54,50
The pinging probe sits motionless at what appears to be a dead end. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS515
00:55:49,00 --> 00:55:54,50
In the tunnel, SOMEONE peers at the map with narrowed eyes. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS516
00:56:44,00 --> 00:56:51,50
Watching video of the holographs in her quarters, SOMEONE speaks into a recorder. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS517
00:56:48,00 --> 00:56:52,50
Holloway enters. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS518
00:57:15,00 --> 00:57:20,50
He sets the rose in a tumbler before here. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS519
00:57:36,00 --> 00:57:41,50
Sitting on his lap she kisses him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS520
00:57:39,00 --> 00:57:44,50
On a small handheld computer 

PROMETHEUS_DVS521
00:57:41,00 --> 00:57:47,50
SOMEONE brings up brings up the matching DNA graphs then hands it over to him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS522
00:57:52,00 --> 00:57:58,50
She leans over and hugs him from behind with a giddy smile. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS523
00:57:58,00 --> 00:58:02,50
She flops down on a bed. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS524
00:58:24,00 --> 00:58:30,50
SOMEONE blinks back tears and shakes her head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS526
00:58:46,00 --> 00:58:51,50
SOMEONE adverts her wounded gaze. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS527
00:58:51,00 --> 00:58:56,50
He tackles her affectionately. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS528
00:58:54,00 --> 00:58:58,50
He kisses her. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS529
00:59:02,00 --> 00:59:09,50
Gazing into her eyes he gives her a tender kiss and rubs her chest. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS530
00:59:07,00 --> 00:59:13,50
SOMEONE caresses his cheek then returns the kiss. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS531
00:59:12,00 --> 00:59:18,50
He leans in and they embrace with mounting passion. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS534
00:59:20,00 --> 00:59:26,50
Reaching down, SOMEONE pulls Holloway's shirt up his torso, revealing his toned sun-kissed back. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS535
00:59:23,00 --> 00:59:29,50
He straightens and she yanks it off impatiently. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS536
00:59:27,00 --> 00:59:32,50
Holloway leans down again and kisses her hungrily. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS538
00:59:33,00 --> 00:59:38,50
Now in a slinky black turtleneck and low ponytail, SOMEONE meanders into the cockpit. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS539
00:59:36,00 --> 00:59:44,50
Above the layout table, the probe beacons add additional detail to the now enormous map of the structure. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS540
00:59:42,00 --> 00:59:49,50
Two yellow beacons SOMEONE and SOMEONE near ground level center. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS541
00:59:46,00 --> 00:59:51,50
Leaning close, she reaches toward the map. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS542
00:59:50,00 --> 00:59:56,50
She turns, in a corner SOMEONE sits with concertina. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS543
01:00:03,00 --> 01:00:08,50
SOMEONE returns her gaze to the map. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS544
01:00:22,00 --> 01:00:28,50
SOMEONE drums the flat ends of his concertina. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS545
01:00:33,00 --> 01:00:37,50
He sips a drink. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS546
01:00:54,00 --> 01:00:59,50
She pauses as he gets to his feet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS547
01:01:04,00 --> 01:01:09,50
SOMEONE  blinks at him and cocks her head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS548
01:01:06,00 --> 01:01:11,50
SOMEONE lifts his brow persistently. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS549
01:01:09,00 --> 01:01:15,50
SOMEONE looks away then faces him with a coy smirk. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS550
01:01:16,00 --> 01:01:21,50
As she marches out, SOMEONE gazes after here. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS551
01:01:29,00 --> 01:01:37,50
As the storm rages outside, SOMEONE's helmet view shows fluid streaming from the urns. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS552
01:01:39,00 --> 01:01:43,50
They wander the chamber. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS553
01:01:44,00 --> 01:01:49,50
SOMEONE exhales smoke in his helmet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS554
01:01:52,00 --> 01:01:58,50
SOMEONE sucks through a plastic hose, then blows a puff of smoke. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS555
01:02:04,00 --> 01:02:08,50
SOMEONE flips the British bird. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS556
01:02:06,00 --> 01:02:11,50
Using a space blanket, SOMEONE flips it back. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS557
01:02:16,00 --> 01:02:21,50
Black fluid streams along the ground. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS558
01:02:24,00 --> 01:02:29,50
A snake-like creature rises from the muck. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS559
01:02:31,00 --> 01:02:35,50
The cockpit stands empty. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS560
01:02:40,00 --> 01:02:45,50
As he edges closer, it rears up. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS561
01:02:43,00 --> 01:02:48,50
SOMEONE falls back on his rear end. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS562
01:03:02,00 --> 01:03:10,50
He reaches a hand out. The creature's head fans out, takes the shape of a porpoise tail. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS563
01:03:07,00 --> 01:03:12,50
Grinning, SOMEONE lingers close. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS564
01:03:11,00 --> 01:03:15,50
He reaches out again. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS566
01:03:21,00 --> 01:03:27,50
The creature's hood wraps around his hand and holds on tight. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS567
01:03:29,00 --> 01:03:34,50
It's serpentine body lashes around his arm. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS568
01:03:46,00 --> 01:03:51,50
It snaps his arm like a twig. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS569
01:03:51,00 --> 01:04:00,50
Using a knife, SOMEONE decapitates it. It sprays green blood, which burns through his helmet acidly. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS570
01:03:57,00 --> 01:04:04,50
The creature's head regenerates and it burrows up SOMEONE's sleeve. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS571
01:04:06,00 --> 01:04:10,50
It reaches his helmet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS572
01:04:08,00 --> 01:04:17,50
SOMEONE falls face first into the black fluid. As he straightens, his melting helmet collapses on his face. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS573
01:04:14,00 --> 01:04:22,50
The serpentine creature plunges into SOMEONE's mouth and forces its way down his throat. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS574
01:04:19,00 --> 01:04:26,50
Now, from the dome's crust, we view a golden sun peeking over the horizon. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS575
01:04:23,00 --> 01:04:31,50
Silhouetted against the windows of SOMEONE's quarters, Holloway hunches over and rubs his face. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS576
01:04:28,00 --> 01:04:36,50
As his partner slumbers peacefully, he shuffles to a mirror. A light switches on above him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS577
01:04:33,00 --> 01:04:43,50
Facing his reflection, he blinks his bleary eyes. He takes a few deep breaths, then removes a gold ring and sets it on the sink. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS578
01:04:42,00 --> 01:04:49,50
Bending over, he splashes water over his face and close cropped hair. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS580
01:04:47,00 --> 01:04:53,50
Facing the mirror again, he peers at his beady bloodshot eyes. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS581
01:04:50,00 --> 01:04:56,50
Broken blood vessels redden the rims of his irises. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS582
01:04:53,00 --> 01:04:59,50
Holloway knits his brow and leans closer to the mirror. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS583
01:04:56,00 --> 01:05:01,50
He lifts a hand hesitantly, then tugs down on the skin beneath his eye. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS585
01:05:01,00 --> 01:05:06,50
Clear fluid streams from his iris. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS586
01:05:07,00 --> 01:05:12,50
She touches an intercom. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS587
01:05:31,00 --> 01:05:36,50
Now an away team leaves the airlock. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS588
01:05:50,00 --> 01:05:54,50
All but SOMEONE board a transport. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS589
01:05:54,00 --> 01:05:59,50
Holloway regards him suspiciously. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS590
01:05:56,00 --> 01:06:03,50
As the transport pulls out, SOMEONE rides beside it on an ATV. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS591
01:06:00,00 --> 01:06:06,50
A lone crew member sees them off, then twirls his finger in the air. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS592
01:06:03,00 --> 01:06:09,50
Later, the vehicles approach the structures gateway. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS594
01:06:08,00 --> 01:06:14,50
Riding behind the transport, SOMEONE halts and gazes after it as it passes through. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS595
01:06:11,00 --> 01:06:16,50
Later in the structure. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS596
01:06:25,00 --> 01:06:32,50
the team progresses downhill to a large open doorway shaped like an egg. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS597
01:06:29,00 --> 01:06:36,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE rides the ATV through the structure's tunnels. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS598
01:06:34,00 --> 01:06:39,50
Sipping from a porcelain cup, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS599
01:06:36,00 --> 01:06:42,50
SOMEONE monitors him by way of a private station. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS600
01:06:39,00 --> 01:06:46,50
She keeps her back to us. Her straight blond hair flowing smoothly past her shoulders. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS601
01:06:44,00 --> 01:06:49,50
SOMEONE halts the ATV with a frown. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS602
01:06:55,00 --> 01:06:59,50
SOMEONE removes his helmet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS603
01:06:57,00 --> 01:07:06,50
His suit's camera shares his view as he proceeds down a corridor marked with urn-shaped etchings. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS604
01:07:05,00 --> 01:07:10,50
He pauses, frowning gravely. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS605
01:07:07,00 --> 01:07:14,50
Several yards ahead in a rounded turn, a red probe light pulsates. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS606
01:07:11,00 --> 01:07:17,50
With an intense stare, he proceeds toward it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS608
01:07:16,00 --> 01:07:22,50
In her lifeboat, SOMEONE watches the feed projected across her windows. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS609
01:07:22,00 --> 01:07:30,50
As SOMEONE progresses, we find the probe hovering before a heart shaped door of multiple oblong panels. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS610
01:07:28,00 --> 01:07:33,50
SOMEONE eyes the probe quizzically, then turns. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS612
01:07:32,00 --> 01:07:37,50
As SOMEONE looks on, he enters a code into a panel beside the door. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS613
01:07:35,00 --> 01:07:40,50
It rises and the probe soars through. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS614
01:07:40,00 --> 01:07:49,50
As SOMEONE ventures forward, the doorway shows thousands of urns stacked in giant hourglass-shaped units. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS615
01:07:46,00 --> 01:07:54,50
The probe casts its flickering light at the far end of the chamber as the android goes in. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS616
01:07:51,00 --> 01:07:57,50
He observes three hourglass formations before him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS617
01:07:55,00 --> 01:08:03,50
Even more urns rest in rows several feet high in recesses cut into the surrounding walls. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS618
01:08:00,00 --> 01:08:06,50
SOMEONE's screen shows the countless supply. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS619
01:08:03,00 --> 01:08:09,50
Looking on, SOMEONE narrows her blue eyes. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS620
01:08:07,00 --> 01:08:12,50
Crossing the mist enshrouded floor, SOMEONE arrives at another code panel. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS622
01:08:11,00 --> 01:08:16,50
He operates it successfully and a door rises before him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS624
01:08:15,00 --> 01:08:23,50
The probes dart past two humanoid figures standing on either side in suits and masks. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS625
01:08:20,00 --> 01:08:26,50
SOMEONE shines his light on the apparent corpses. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS626
01:08:23,00 --> 01:08:29,50
Turning ahead, he slows, his lips parting. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS627
01:08:26,00 --> 01:08:32,50
The probe darts out past him as he enters the chamber. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS628
01:08:31,00 --> 01:08:36,50
Sarcophagus-like pods lie before him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS629
01:08:34,00 --> 01:08:41,50
As SOMEONE watches from her lifeboat, SOMEONE cuts off the video feed. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS631
01:08:45,00 --> 01:08:56,50
Within the chamber, we drift up to find two more giant pods resting opposite their counterparts atop a hundred foot disc marked with a spiderweb-like pattern. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS632
01:08:53,00 --> 01:09:00,50
Massive pillars stripe the surrounding concave walls. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS633
01:08:57,00 --> 01:09:03,50
SOMEONE ventures in, dwarfed by the massive disk. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS635
01:09:01,00 --> 01:09:07,50
The rest of the away team arrives at the chamber with the bust. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS636
01:09:06,00 --> 01:09:11,50
SOMEONE eyes the humanoid corpse. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS637
01:09:09,00 --> 01:09:14,50
Behind SOMEONE, Holloway stumbles. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS638
01:09:18,00 --> 01:09:22,50
They enter the fatal chamber. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS640
01:09:22,00 --> 01:09:27,50
SOMEONE leans over an urn, peering closely with his flashlight. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS641
01:09:27,00 --> 01:09:33,50
The team moves through the dark, treacherous space. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS642
01:09:40,00 --> 01:09:47,50
As SOMEONE stares, SOMEONE finds a body lying face down in his suit. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS643
01:09:55,00 --> 01:09:59,50
He sits on the ground. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS644
01:10:05,00 --> 01:10:12,50
His skin bears no color. The others find SOMEONE's face green and distorted. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS645
01:10:24,00 --> 01:10:29,50
The serpentine creature leaps out at them. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS646
01:10:27,00 --> 01:10:31,50
It slithers away. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS647
01:10:36,00 --> 01:10:41,50
Leading the team out, SOMEONE supports Holloway. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS648
01:10:42,00 --> 01:10:47,50
Ducking out, Holloway collapses. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS649
01:11:02,00 --> 01:11:06,50
SOMEONE passes Ravel. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS650
01:11:08,00 --> 01:11:13,50
As she goes, Ravel watches the monitors. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS651
01:11:13,00 --> 01:11:24,50
At the edge of the giant disk, SOMEONE circles around a curved, throne-like chair to a control panel with rows of buttons the size and shape of eggs. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS652
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:26,50
As he presses a sequence of them 

PROMETHEUS_DVS653
01:11:23,00 --> 01:11:29,50
they squish beneath his touch like soft hollow rubber. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS654
01:11:26,00 --> 01:11:33,50
An untouched button on the end pulsates with light from within. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS655
01:11:30,00 --> 01:11:34,50
SOMEONE presses it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS656
01:11:32,00 --> 01:11:37,50
The throne-like chair rotates in his direction. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS657
01:11:36,00 --> 01:11:45,50
His flashlight sweeps over a treelike design on the backrest with twin egg-like patterns at the top. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS658
01:11:44,00 --> 01:11:50,50
SOMEONE climbs on the seat and leans back into it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS659
01:11:47,00 --> 01:11:52,50
A holographic recording plays back. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS660
01:11:50,00 --> 01:11:56,50
Showing a helmetless engineer stepping up on the disk. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS661
01:11:53,00 --> 01:11:57,50
SOMEONE grins giddily. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS662
01:12:00,00 --> 01:12:08,50
SOMEONE shines his flashlight at the first, who bends over at one of the sarcophagus-like pods. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS663
01:12:05,00 --> 01:12:12,50
He gestures to a few others, who walk in and circle the disc. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS664
01:12:09,00 --> 01:12:14,50
One continues toward SOMEONE. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS665
01:12:11,00 --> 01:12:18,50
The Android springs from the chair as the engineer takes a seat in it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS666
01:12:15,00 --> 01:12:19,50
SOMEONE cocks his head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS667
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:23,50
Curiously looking on as the alien rotates the chair to face the controls. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS668
01:12:21,00 --> 01:12:26,50
He picks up a reed-like flute and plays. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS669
01:12:25,00 --> 01:12:31,50
A blue and green holographic sphere rises before the pilot. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS670
01:12:29,00 --> 01:12:35,50
Connected to the horse shoe shaped panel by streams of green energy. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS672
01:12:35,00 --> 01:12:41,50
As the pilot works the controls, more emerald hued fields of energy appear above them. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS673
01:12:38,00 --> 01:12:43,50
SOMEONE lowers a gloved hand, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS674
01:12:40,00 --> 01:12:45,50
and the energy rises up to connect with it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS675
01:12:43,00 --> 01:12:50,50
The android climbs up on the disc and crouches, studying the control panel. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS676
01:12:49,00 --> 01:12:55,50
In the recording, the leader walks over to the pilot and crouches to face him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS678
01:12:54,00 --> 01:12:58,50
SOMEONE listens to their exchange. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS679
01:12:56,00 --> 01:13:08,50
A tremendous, three-dimensional holographic orb appears over the center of the disc. Cerulean points of light webbed together within swirl about in steady patterns. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS680
01:13:05,00 --> 01:13:12,50
A star system appears in its midst, complete with a ringed planet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS681
01:13:10,00 --> 01:13:16,50
Staring, SOMEONE approaches the intergalactic map. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS683
01:13:14,00 --> 01:13:21,50
Higher up, smaller spheres with concentric orbital rings revolve around the disk. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS684
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:25,50
SOMEONE steps into the mains sphere and orbital rings appear around it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS686
01:13:24,00 --> 01:13:30,50
Spreading his arms wide, the pilot leans back as if playing an organ. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS687
01:13:29,00 --> 01:13:40,50
The main sphere diminishes and darts aside. One of the smaller orbs takes its place and grows. Smiling wondrously in its midst, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS688
01:13:37,00 --> 01:13:43,50
SOMEONE looks up and finds a glowing sphere hovering directly above him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS689
01:13:41,00 --> 01:13:46,50
He spreads his arms wide and turns on the spot. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS690
01:13:43,00 --> 01:13:52,50
The pilot presses more buttons and another orb drifts downward in a net of green energy beams. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS692
01:13:50,00 --> 01:13:56,50
Reaching up, SOMEONE catches it lightly in his gloved hand. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS693
01:13:53,00 --> 01:14:01,50
As he peers curiously at the softly glowing orb, we recognize the continent of Africa. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS694
01:13:59,00 --> 01:14:07,50
He releases the model of earth, letting it float back up again and gazes after it ardently. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS695
01:14:04,00 --> 01:14:10,50
His arms spread, SOMEONE sways on the spot. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS696
01:14:12,00 --> 01:14:17,50
The recording abruptly cuts out. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS697
01:14:14,00 --> 01:14:22,50
As SOMEONE steadies himself his bewildered gaze lands on the holographic model of earth. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS698
01:14:20,00 --> 01:14:27,50
Rotating inches above a translucent cone-shaped face the image fades. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS699
01:14:24,00 --> 01:14:28,50
SOMEONE turns. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS700
01:14:25,00 --> 01:14:31,50
A  soft golden glow flickering on his face. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS701
01:14:28,00 --> 01:14:34,50
From within one of the pods an amber light fades. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS702
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:37,50
Aiming his flashlight, the android approaches it wearily. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS703
01:14:38,00 --> 01:14:46,50
Its ornate translucent lid ends at the head with an egg-shaped hatch equipped with a handle. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS704
01:14:43,00 --> 01:14:51,50
SOMEONE flashlight beam shines through the barrier, revealing an engineer lying inside. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS705
01:14:48,00 --> 01:14:57,50
He rests motionlessly with his eyes closed and a breathing mask covering his nose and mouth. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS706
01:14:54,00 --> 01:15:00,50
SOMEONE plants a gloved hand and the lid and crouches close to the pod. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS707
01:14:58,00 --> 01:15:03,50
Turning his head  he leans an ear close to it. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS708
01:15:03,00 --> 01:15:09,50
SOMEONE's lips curl into a happy smile. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS709
01:15:06,00 --> 01:15:12,50
Meanwhile the rest of the team boards the transport. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS710
01:15:24,00 --> 01:15:29,50
SOMEONE cradles Holloway as he arrives. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS711
01:15:27,00 --> 01:15:33,50
Discolored bumps on his skin spread and darken. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS712
01:15:30,00 --> 01:15:34,50
The transport doors open. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS713
01:15:35,00 --> 01:15:39,50
The crew climbs out. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS714
01:15:51,00 --> 01:15:57,50
SOMEONE strides through the hanger and grabs a flamethrower. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS715
01:15:59,00 --> 01:16:06,50
As the door lowers, SOMEONE stops halfway down, wielding the menacing weapon. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS716
01:16:11,00 --> 01:16:15,50
Holloway collapses. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS717
01:16:14,00 --> 01:16:19,50
As SOMEONE goes to help, SOMEONE joins SOMEONE. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS718
01:16:40,00 --> 01:16:51,50
Holloway steps toward SOMEONE, his arms outstretched. SOMEONE holds SOMEONE back. SOMEONE ignites the flamethrower, setting Holloway on fire. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS719
01:16:49,00 --> 01:16:57,50
His body completely engulfed Holloway drops to his knees. SOMEONE sobs on the ground. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS720
01:16:56,00 --> 01:17:02,50
As Holloway's fiery body falls face first and lies still, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS721
01:16:59,00 --> 01:17:05,50
SOMEONE watches with a horrified expression. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS722
01:17:03,00 --> 01:17:09,50
SOMEONE opens her mouth wide in a grief stricken wail. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS723
01:17:07,00 --> 01:17:12,50
Later, wearing a white tunic, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS724
01:17:09,00 --> 01:17:14,50
she sleeps on a wide lit exam table. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS725
01:17:12,00 --> 01:17:17,50
A pair of hands reach for her cross, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS726
01:17:14,00 --> 01:17:19,50
and she instinctively grabs at them. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS727
01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:44,50
SOMEONE nods gently, and she allows him to remove her necklace. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS728
01:17:41,00 --> 01:17:48,50
As he steps away, SOMEONE lets her arms relax at her sides. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS729
01:17:49,00 --> 01:17:53,50
He puts the cross in a jar. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS730
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:17,50
He runs a scan of her abdomen. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS731
01:18:20,00 --> 01:18:25,50
SOMEONE sits up, her jaw slack. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS732
01:18:50,00 --> 01:18:55,50
She stares wide-eyed and her lips stammer. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS733
01:18:56,00 --> 01:19:01,50
She scoots off the table. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS734
01:19:02,00 --> 01:19:08,50
She taps buttons on the exam table's panel. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS735
01:19:21,00 --> 01:19:25,50
She grips his shoulders. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS736
01:19:24,00 --> 01:19:29,50
Her mouth opens wide and she doubles over. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS737
01:19:33,00 --> 01:19:38,50
SOMEONE injects her in the back of the shoulder. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS738
01:19:38,00 --> 01:19:44,50
He lifts her limp body back on to the table. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS739
01:19:50,00 --> 01:19:56,50
As SOMEONE shifts to lie on her back, SOMEONE gazes down at her. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS740
01:20:09,00 --> 01:20:16,50
A tear falls from SOMEONE's eye and she shakes her head in confusion. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS741
01:20:19,00 --> 01:20:23,50
SOMEONE's lips tremble. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS742
01:20:21,00 --> 01:20:27,50
SOMEONE snatches the jar with her necklace and strides out. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS743
01:20:24,00 --> 01:20:30,50
SOMEONE, lying nearly motionless, stares up at the ceiling. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS744
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:33,50
Taking a few deep breaths she drifts off to sleep. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS746
01:20:32,00 --> 01:20:36,50
She lies asleep on her side. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS747
01:20:34,00 --> 01:20:42,50
A hand in an oversized yellow glove gives her cheek a few brisk taps. SOMEONE remains motionless. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS748
01:20:56,00 --> 01:21:04,50
As a crewman in a containment suit approaches, SOMEONE whacks him with a metal object, then heads forward. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS749
01:21:02,00 --> 01:21:10,50
As the crewman forces her down, SOMEONE presses up on the plastic covering his face. She kicks him off of her. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS750
01:21:08,00 --> 01:21:14,50
As she gets down from the table, she falls briefly, clutching her abdomen. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS751
01:21:11,00 --> 01:21:19,50
SOMEONE races from the room but almost immediately collapses against the wall in pain. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS752
01:21:16,00 --> 01:21:21,50
Gritting her teeth she hurries on. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS753
01:21:18,00 --> 01:21:26,50
SOMEONE arrives in the room housing Vickers' med pod. She uses its touchscreen panel. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS754
01:21:41,00 --> 01:21:46,50
She selects manual procedure. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS755
01:21:57,00 --> 01:22:03,50
As the med pod rotates and tilts into an upright position, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS756
01:22:00,00 --> 01:22:06,50
the clear domed lid opens in three sections. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS757
01:22:03,00 --> 01:22:12,50
SOMEONE quickly removes her white hospital gown, revealing her bandage-like underwear, and grabs two auto-injectors. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS758
01:22:10,00 --> 01:22:15,50
She holds one in her mouth as she stabs her thigh with the other. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS759
01:22:15,00 --> 01:22:23,50
She limps over to the med pod and positions herself on the upright table under a curved scanner. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS760
01:22:21,00 --> 01:22:27,50
As the two bottom sections of the lid come together like a set of doors, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS761
01:22:24,00 --> 01:22:30,50
the upper section lowers down over the patient. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS762
01:22:27,00 --> 01:22:32,50
SOMEONE's taut belly bulges. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS763
01:22:29,00 --> 01:22:40,50
As the med pod lowers back down, SOMEONE scoots herself into position. She makes a few selections from a touch screen, projected over her head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS764
01:22:40,00 --> 01:22:45,50
The scanner glides over her body. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS765
01:22:44,00 --> 01:22:49,50
A band of green light scans her abdomen. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS766
01:22:50,00 --> 01:22:57,50
As her stomach bulges up normally an image of the alien fetus appears on the screen before her. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS767
01:22:59,00 --> 01:23:06,50
A robotic arm equipped for surgical tools sprays anesthetics across her stomach below her belly button. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS768
01:23:04,00 --> 01:23:09,50
Three more arms position themselves. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS769
01:23:08,00 --> 01:23:14,50
One of the arms performs a precision cut with a laser. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS770
01:23:11,00 --> 01:23:16,50
SOMEONE arches her head way back. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS771
01:23:13,00 --> 01:23:18,50
The muscles in her neck tense as she grits her teeth. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS772
01:23:16,00 --> 01:23:22,50
As the robotic arms on either side of her pry back her skin, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS773
01:23:19,00 --> 01:23:29,50
SOMEONE's mouth opens wide in a pained SOMEONE. A large pair of forceps rotates into position at the top of the arched scanner. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS774
01:23:26,00 --> 01:23:32,50
As they lower toward her, SOMEONE gives herself another injection. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS776
01:23:31,00 --> 01:23:37,50
Her head relaxes back, then tenses again as the forceps dip into her open abdomen. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS777
01:23:34,00 --> 01:23:44,50
The forceps slowly pull the creature out. A thick tentacle wiggles inside an egg-shaped sac the size of SOMEONE's head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS778
01:23:41,00 --> 01:23:48,50
Relaxing a bit SOMEONE lifts her head of the table and stares slack-jawed. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS779
01:23:46,00 --> 01:23:54,50
The sac brakes open splattering her with bloody fluid and revealing the squid-like alien. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS780
01:23:56,00 --> 01:24:06,50
She quickly grabs the umbilical cord and yanks it out. As she makes a selection on the overhead screen, the alien's four tentacles spread open and it moves its head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS781
01:24:04,00 --> 01:24:11,50
Gritting her teeth, SOMEONE watches the robotic arm staple her stomach shut. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS782
01:24:08,00 --> 01:24:14,50
Above her the alien baby wriggles more vigorously. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS783
01:24:11,00 --> 01:24:17,50
Flailing its tentacles it tries to free itself from the forceps' grip. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS784
01:24:17,00 --> 01:24:24,50
The med pot starts to tilt upright and SOMEONE slams a button beside her. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS785
01:24:21,00 --> 01:24:30,50
The lid slowly opens. SOMEONE scoots down, flattening her head to one side it passes under the flailing alien. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS786
01:24:27,00 --> 01:24:34,50
Reaching the end of the table she quickly rushes around to the outer control panel. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS787
01:24:35,00 --> 01:24:43,50
The doors close back up, trapping the baby alien inside, and a white mist fills the chamber. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS788
01:24:40,00 --> 01:24:46,50
SOMEONE sinks to her knees and catches her breath. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS789
01:24:43,00 --> 01:24:48,50
She grabs some more auto-injectors from a cart, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS790
01:24:45,00 --> 01:24:50,50
then watches the baby alien grow still. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS791
01:24:48,00 --> 01:24:54,50
She quickly opens the room's door and hurries out of Vickers' life boat. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS792
01:24:52,00 --> 01:25:00,50
Inside the med pod blood drips from the alien's long egg-shaped head as it hangs motionless. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS793
01:25:00,00 --> 01:25:04,50
Now, on the bridge. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS794
01:25:21,00 --> 01:25:28,50
A crewman stops halfway down the lowering ramp in a space suit and helmet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS796
01:25:27,00 --> 01:25:36,50
He cocks his head, then moves closer to SOMEONE who sits crouched on the ground with his legs bent forward over his shoulders. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS797
01:25:34,00 --> 01:25:39,50
On the bridge, SOMEONE's eyes shift nervously. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS798
01:25:37,00 --> 01:25:41,50
The crewman kicks SOMEONE's foot, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS799
01:25:39,00 --> 01:25:45,50
then backs away a few steps. He turns to a crewmate. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS800
01:25:45,00 --> 01:25:50,50
SOMEONE stands upright. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS801
01:25:47,00 --> 01:25:54,50
His smashed open helmet reveals his grotesquely deformed features. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS802
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:58,50
The mutant backhands him, breaking open his helmet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS803
01:25:57,00 --> 01:26:05,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE hurriedly limps down a corridor. In the hanger, the mutant SOMEONE flings Wallace to the ground. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS804
01:26:03,00 --> 01:26:13,50
The mutant leaps on Wallace's stomach and the crewman spews blood. The mutant smashes both fists through his helmet, pummeling his face. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS805
01:26:16,00 --> 01:26:28,50
A crewman fires at the mutant, who turns his head angrily. Meanwhile SOMEONE turns briefly as she makes her way past a hanging space suit. A door to another corridor opens for her. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS806
01:26:25,00 --> 01:26:32,50
Meanwhile,  crewmen fire flamethrowers and guns at the mutant. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS807
01:26:31,00 --> 01:26:41,50
On fire, the mutant speedily scales a smooth wall, then leaps down, tackling a crewman. SOMEONE and SOMEONE stand at the air-locked door. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS808
01:26:41,00 --> 01:26:52,50
Two guys fire on the mutant as he flings a third against a transport's window. As the men escape into a transport, the mutant lodges a metal tool into ones back and pulls him out. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS809
01:26:49,00 --> 01:26:56,50
The mutant falls back and the guys run over him with the transport. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS810
01:26:54,00 --> 01:27:02,50
As the vehicle takes off, SOMEONE and SOMEONE arrive, dousing the mutant with fire and bullets. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS811
01:27:02,00 --> 01:27:08,50
SOMEONE lowers the flamethrower and watches the body burn. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS812
01:27:10,00 --> 01:27:17,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE gives herself another shot, then drops the auto-injector. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS813
01:27:15,00 --> 01:27:22,50
Our view rises from her thigh up her blood-spattered body to her drawn face. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS814
01:27:19,00 --> 01:27:28,50
She peers down a corridor, then lowers her hand from a concave wall, and shuffles toward a set of rounded doors. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS815
01:27:29,00 --> 01:27:34,50
She presses a button and the doors part. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS816
01:27:34,00 --> 01:27:40,50
She staggers into a room and collapses to her knees. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS817
01:27:37,00 --> 01:27:42,50
A man dressed in white notices her, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS818
01:27:40,00 --> 01:27:45,50
then helps her to her feet along with a guard. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS819
01:27:42,00 --> 01:27:47,50
SOMEONE notices her as well. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS820
01:27:44,00 --> 01:27:51,50
He quickly takes off his white coat and wraps it around the half-naked woman. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS821
01:27:49,00 --> 01:27:54,50
SOMEONE stares at her, sitting in a wheelchair. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS822
01:27:52,00 --> 01:27:57,50
He watches as the guard helps her take a seat. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS823
01:27:54,00 --> 01:28:00,50
Shivering, SOMEONE notices the old man. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS824
01:27:57,00 --> 01:28:02,50
SOMEONE returns to SOMEONE and kneels on the floor. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS825
01:28:00,00 --> 01:28:04,50
He washes the old man's feet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS826
01:28:54,00 --> 01:28:58,50
SOMEONE hands SOMEONE a cane. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS827
01:28:56,00 --> 01:29:00,50
then helps him put on his slippers. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS828
01:29:08,00 --> 01:29:14,50
SOMEONE and the aid help the decrepit old man to his feet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS829
01:29:56,00 --> 01:30:02,50
SOMEONE turns away from SOMEONE and his aide readies his wheelchair. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS831
01:30:05,00 --> 01:30:10,50
SOMEONE lowers her distraught gaze. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS832
01:30:08,00 --> 01:30:14,50
Now in her cabin, she leans over her sink. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS833
01:30:16,00 --> 01:30:22,50
She splashes water on her face, then looks over the counter. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS834
01:30:23,00 --> 01:30:31,50
She picks up Holloway's ring, studies it, then slides it the ring finger of her left hand. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS835
01:30:29,00 --> 01:30:34,50
Gazing thoughtfully, she covers her mouth. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS837
01:30:35,00 --> 01:30:41,50
As she sets her hands on the counter, we glimpse the line of staples two inches under her navel. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS838
01:30:42,00 --> 01:30:48,50
Nodding, she glances around, then looks over the counter. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS840
01:30:50,00 --> 01:30:56,50
She pops a pill in her mouth, then drinks from a glass of water. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS841
01:30:53,00 --> 01:30:59,50
Later, she puts on her spacesuit and zips it up. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS842
01:31:02,00 --> 01:31:09,50
SOMEONE enters the cabin and notices his colleague in her formfitting suit. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS843
01:31:06,00 --> 01:31:12,50
SOMEONE returns to the sink and pops another pill. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS844
01:31:42,00 --> 01:31:46,50
SOMEONE heads out. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS845
01:31:45,00 --> 01:31:50,50
He stops at the door, then returns to SOMEONE. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS846
01:32:36,00 --> 01:32:43,50
Holding her gaze SOMEONE steps back and leans against the wall. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS847
01:32:41,00 --> 01:32:49,50
Now in SOMEONE's bedchamber, SOMEONE stands by as SOMEONE works on the back of the old man's space suit. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS848
01:32:47,00 --> 01:32:52,50
Doors part for SOMEONE and she steps into the room. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS849
01:32:50,00 --> 01:32:54,50
Two guards stand outside. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS850
01:33:05,00 --> 01:33:13,50
SOMEONE and the others step out, then the door slides shut, leaving SOMEONE alone with the old man. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS851
01:33:14,00 --> 01:33:18,50
SOMEONE peers at her. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS852
01:33:24,00 --> 01:33:28,50
He sits on his bed. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS853
01:33:40,00 --> 01:33:46,50
She approaches him and he averts his gaze. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS854
01:33:50,00 --> 01:33:55,50
Kneeling, she caresses his hand. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS855
01:33:57,00 --> 01:34:02,50
SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE bows her head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS856
01:34:00,00 --> 01:34:05,50
She rubs her nose over his knuckles and he makes a fist. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS857
01:34:04,00 --> 01:34:08,50
She looks up at him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS858
01:34:07,00 --> 01:34:11,50
He meets her piercing gaze. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS861
01:34:28,00 --> 01:34:34,50
She rises to her feet, Now, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE sitting in the corner of an equipment room. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS862
01:34:37,00 --> 01:34:42,50
He picks up a helmet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS863
01:34:43,00 --> 01:34:50,50
Meanwhile SOMEONE walks down a corridor with SOMEONE and his aide close behind. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS864
01:35:05,00 --> 01:35:09,50
SOMEONE stands. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS865
01:35:12,00 --> 01:35:17,50
She doubles over in pain. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS866
01:35:14,00 --> 01:35:18,50
SOMEONE crosses the room. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS867
01:35:16,00 --> 01:35:24,50
Now a transport vehicle sets out from the ship leaving a trail of dust in its wake. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS868
01:35:22,00 --> 01:35:30,50
Later, in the network of tunnels, a flashlight shines through the darkness, leading the team. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS869
01:35:47,00 --> 01:35:52,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE slack-jawed. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS870
01:35:53,00 --> 01:35:58,50
A door rises and SOMEONE leads the group onward. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS871
01:36:01,00 --> 01:36:12,50
SOMEONE lags behind. The only one still wearing her helmet. As she shines her flashlight over the urns, SOMEONE watches a video feed from the bridge. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS872
01:36:19,00 --> 01:36:25,50
SOMEONE looks over the urns. The captain leaves his chair. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS873
01:36:27,00 --> 01:36:31,50
SOMEONE sits at a work station. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS874
01:36:30,00 --> 01:36:35,50
SOMEONE stands at the layout table. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS875
01:36:38,00 --> 01:36:44,50
A hologram shows the tunnel system without the surrounding terrain. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS876
01:36:43,00 --> 01:36:48,50
An alarmed SOMEONE stands upright. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS877
01:36:46,00 --> 01:36:53,50
The hologram represents an elaborate crescent shaped vessel with blunted ends. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS878
01:36:58,00 --> 01:37:04,50
Now SOMEONE leads the group into the chamber housing the giant disc. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS879
01:37:12,00 --> 01:37:20,50
He hops down from the platform, then sits in the chair and blows into the flute, calling up a holographic orb. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS881
01:37:45,00 --> 01:37:48,50
crosses the disc. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS883
01:37:50,00 --> 01:37:54,50
He leads them to the working pod. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS884
01:37:53,00 --> 01:37:58,50
SOMEONE collapses to her knees in pain. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS885
01:38:01,00 --> 01:38:05,50
SOMEONE takes off her helmet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS886
01:38:02,00 --> 01:38:07,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch from the bridge. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS887
01:38:08,00 --> 01:38:14,50
SOMEONE touches amber lit symbols on the pod. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS888
01:38:13,00 --> 01:38:17,50
It opens. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS889
01:38:19,00 --> 01:38:25,50
SOMEONE steps past his aide who lowers a gun. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS890
01:38:23,00 --> 01:38:30,50
As the engineer sits up, several tubes detach from his oxygen mask. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS891
01:38:28,00 --> 01:38:33,50
He takes off his headgear and hunches over. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS892
01:38:31,00 --> 01:38:41,50
As he rises to his feet more tubing detaches. Standing upright, the pale bald titan looks over his mesmerized visitors. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS893
01:38:40,00 --> 01:38:47,50
As the engineer crouches, SOMEONE stumbles but SOMEONE and his aide catch him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS894
01:38:49,00 --> 01:38:53,50
The engineer looks at SOMEONE. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS895
01:39:07,00 --> 01:39:12,50
The aide strikes SOMEONE in the gut with his gun. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS896
01:39:24,00 --> 01:39:30,50
The engineer looks at SOMEONE who eagerly waits for a reply. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS897
01:39:28,00 --> 01:39:33,50
He gently lays his hand on the top of SOMEONE's head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS898
01:39:30,00 --> 01:39:38,50
With both hands, he grabs SOMEONE by the throat, then lifts him off his feet and breaks his neck. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS899
01:39:38,00 --> 01:39:46,50
He rips SOMEONE's head off and strikes SOMEONE with it. The aide shoots the engineer, and he drops the head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS900
01:39:46,00 --> 01:39:53,50
The engineer turns SOMEONE around and palms her chest, knocking her off the platform. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS901
01:39:51,00 --> 01:39:59,50
He strikes the aide, flings him into a wall across the chamber, then spots SOMEONE running away, but lets her go. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS902
01:39:59,00 --> 01:40:04,50
SOMEONE slows to a stop and braces herself on a wall. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS903
01:40:02,00 --> 01:40:07,50
Now SOMEONE lies wounded on the floor. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS904
01:40:09,00 --> 01:40:14,50
SOMEONE's head lies about a foot away. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS905
01:40:11,00 --> 01:40:16,50
Eyes open, the android twitches. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS906
01:40:20,00 --> 01:40:26,50
On the bridge SOMEONE watches a video feed showing her father's heart rate. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS907
01:40:27,00 --> 01:40:31,50
She leaves the monitor. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS908
01:40:29,00 --> 01:40:33,50
Ravel watches the feed. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS909
01:40:30,00 --> 01:40:39,50
SOMEONE looks at his rattled shipmate, then lowers his gaze. He licks his lips, then shifts in his seat. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS910
01:40:36,00 --> 01:40:40,50
SOMEONE rubs his mouth. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS911
01:40:45,00 --> 01:40:51,50
Now the engineer crouches over the holographic orb. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS912
01:40:50,00 --> 01:40:58,50
The center of the disc drops, then rotates counter clockwise and opens for a head and pillar to emerge. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS913
01:40:56,00 --> 01:41:01,50
SOMEONE tries to look in its direction. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS914
01:40:58,00 --> 01:41:03,50
The engineer stands upright. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS915
01:41:00,00 --> 01:41:06,50
The rising pillar tilts, attached to a base with a seat, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS916
01:41:03,00 --> 01:41:08,50
like a cannon attached to a gunner chair. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS917
01:41:06,00 --> 01:41:12,50
The engineer faces the imposing device. SOMEONE watches him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS918
01:41:09,00 --> 01:41:14,50
The gunner chair rotates. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS919
01:41:17,00 --> 01:41:22,50
Running through a tunnel, SOMEONE glances back. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS920
01:41:19,00 --> 01:41:27,50
As the engineer climbs onto the gunner chair, we glimpse SOMEONE's motionless face in profile. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS921
01:41:24,00 --> 01:41:30,50
The engineer takes a seat, then activates the star map. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS922
01:41:27,00 --> 01:41:35,50
A holographic sphere emerges around him, and widening outer rings flip into place. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS923
01:41:33,00 --> 01:41:38,50
SOMEONE stops to catch her breath. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS924
01:41:38,00 --> 01:41:47,50
As the engineer works the controls, a brief flash illuminates his crescent shaped ship. A helmet closes over him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS925
01:41:48,00 --> 01:41:58,50
The helmet shields his face, then more armor shields his body. Smoke blasts from a circle of ports, blotting out our view of the ship's underbelly. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS926
01:41:55,00 --> 01:42:01,50
A torrent of smoke shoots through the tunnel, knocking SOMEONE off her feet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS927
01:41:58,00 --> 01:42:04,50
The exhaust hurls her through  passage leading outside. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS928
01:42:01,00 --> 01:42:08,50
Through a window, the crew watches thin plumes of smoke rise from the ground. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS930
01:42:10,00 --> 01:42:20,50
As our view retracts through the star map a holographic line sets out from the gunner chair and targets hologram of the planet earth. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS931
01:42:18,00 --> 01:42:25,50
Amid the flow of exhaust, SOMEONE grabs hold of a ledge, and pulls herself out of a hole in the ground. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS932
01:42:23,00 --> 01:42:34,50
She rises to her feet, standing beside one of the erupting plumes. She runs for SOMEONE, but the ground fissures, threatening to cut her off from the ship. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS933
01:42:31,00 --> 01:42:37,50
As the gap widens she jumps the fissure and runs on. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS934
01:42:34,00 --> 01:42:40,50
We glimpse the ceiling opening up over the crescent shaped ship. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS936
01:42:47,00 --> 01:42:51,50
Running for SOMEONE, SOMEONE jumps another gap, but falls short and grabs hold of the opposite ledge. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS937
01:42:48,00 --> 01:42:53,50
She pulls herself up, then finds her path blocked for certain. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS938
01:43:31,00 --> 01:43:38,50
SOMEONE glimpses the rising ship, then flees the shifting ground. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS940
01:43:37,00 --> 01:43:42,50
As she dashes across the rocky terrain, the massive ship ascends in the background. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS942
01:43:44,00 --> 01:43:48,50
SOMEONE stumbles but gets up and takes cover behind a rocky pillar. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS943
01:44:23,00 --> 01:44:28,50
SOMEONE gives his captain an affirming glance. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS944
01:44:25,00 --> 01:44:35,50
Now SOMEONE runs through a corridor, unzipping her clothes. Reaching the escape pods she opens a pod door and grabs a space suit. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS945
01:44:33,00 --> 01:44:41,50
Blue flames ignite from the engines. SOMEONE puts on his baseball cap as he takes the helm. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS946
01:44:58,00 --> 01:45:05,50
The four firing engines lift the SOMEONE off the ground. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS947
01:45:02,00 --> 01:45:11,50
The crescent shaped ship rotates, its blunted ends turning toward the human's vessel as it rises into the sky. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS948
01:45:11,00 --> 01:45:18,50
The lifeboat section ejects from the ship. SOMEONE readies her space suit. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS949
01:45:18,00 --> 01:45:26,50
The lifeboat lands on the barren terrains, smashing a rocky pillar before it slides to a stop. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS950
01:45:24,00 --> 01:45:28,50
On the bridge. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS951
01:45:29,00 --> 01:45:33,50
SOMEONE gets in the escape pod 

PROMETHEUS_DVS952
01:45:34,00 --> 01:45:38,50
The pod ejects from the ship 

PROMETHEUS_DVS953
01:45:36,00 --> 01:45:42,50
SOMEONE watches as it loops around and swoops past her. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS954
01:45:39,00 --> 01:45:44,50
Touching ground, it slides to a stop. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS955
01:45:41,00 --> 01:45:48,50
In the cockpit, SOMEONE stands at the helm, his shipmate seated behind him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS956
01:45:48,00 --> 01:45:53,50
SOMEONE rockets towards its target. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS957
01:45:54,00 --> 01:45:59,50
The three shipmates raise their arms overhead. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS958
01:45:56,00 --> 01:46:04,50
SOMEONE's nose pierces the outer wall of the larger ship, creating a fiery explosion. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS959
01:46:02,00 --> 01:46:08,50
As the engineer's ship careens a brilliant burst flashes, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS960
01:46:05,00 --> 01:46:10,50
Followed by an outpouring of smoke and SOMEONE. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS962
01:46:11,00 --> 01:46:14,50
SOMEONE watches from the ground as does SOMEONE. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS963
01:46:12,00 --> 01:46:18,50
the crescent shaped ship turns sideways and descends to the ground. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS964
01:46:15,00 --> 01:46:22,50
One of its blunted ends crash lands before the two survivors. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS965
01:46:22,00 --> 01:46:33,50
Huge plumes of smoke and SOMEONE billow from the point of impact. SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare at the towering vessel, their jaws hanging slack. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS966
01:46:33,00 --> 01:46:43,50
The crescent shaped ship rolls their way, tipping on to the second of its blunted ends. SOMEONE and SOMEONE break into a run. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS967
01:46:41,00 --> 01:46:49,50
The second massive stub crashes into the ground behind them, and the ship keeps rolling. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS968
01:46:47,00 --> 01:46:56,50
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE desperately try to outrun the trundling vessel, fiery chunks of SOMEONE strike the ground all around them. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS969
01:46:53,00 --> 01:47:02,50
The rolling ship chases them past a number of rocky pillars, dotting the harsh terrain, its shadow at their heels. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS970
01:47:03,00 --> 01:47:08,50
SOMEONE trips and falls face down. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS971
01:47:07,00 --> 01:47:14,50
As SOMEONE keeps running, SOMEONE looks up at the looming mass, then rolls out of its way. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS972
01:47:11,00 --> 01:47:18,50
She rises to her knees and watches SOMEONE fall to the ground up ahead. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS973
01:47:15,00 --> 01:47:22,50
Flailing on her back, SOMEONE watches the ship's outer wall close in. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS974
01:47:22,00 --> 01:47:26,50
The ship' slows to a stop. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS975
01:47:23,00 --> 01:47:29,50
Now on its back, its blunted ends aloft. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS976
01:47:27,00 --> 01:47:33,50
Gawking at the towering vessel, SOMEONE rises to her feet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS977
01:47:32,00 --> 01:47:38,50
The upright ship begins to tip her way. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS978
01:47:38,00 --> 01:47:48,50
She falls on her rear, scurries back toward some jagged rocks, then watches one end of the ship come down with no chance of escape. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS979
01:47:49,00 --> 01:47:55,50
As the impact plots out our view, we glimpse a burst of sparks. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS980
01:47:58,00 --> 01:48:06,50
SOMEONE lies in a pocket left underneath the ship, saved by the formation of jagged rocks behind her. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS981
01:48:05,00 --> 01:48:12,50
She looks at her wrist then turns on her side and glances around. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS982
01:48:12,00 --> 01:48:16,50
She crawls out from under the ship. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS984
01:48:18,00 --> 01:48:26,50
She rises to her feet, staggers a few steps, then glimpses an expanse of the vessel's outer wall. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS985
01:48:24,00 --> 01:48:29,50
The engineer's ship forms a semi-circle around her. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS986
01:48:29,00 --> 01:48:36,50
Turning, SOMEONE sees the lifeboat and staggers over the SOMEONE littered ground. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS987
01:48:33,00 --> 01:48:38,50
Small fires dot the field. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS988
01:48:35,00 --> 01:48:41,50
Nearing the craft, SOMEONE pauses and doubles over. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS989
01:48:38,00 --> 01:48:47,50
Straightening she sways on her feet, then perseveres  to the compartment's open entryway and climbs up. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS990
01:48:50,00 --> 01:48:57,50
She swings her legs over, pushes herself up on all fours and gets to her feet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS991
01:48:55,00 --> 01:49:02,50
SOMEONE stumbles to a touchscreen control panel and works it with shaking hands. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS992
01:49:00,00 --> 01:49:07,50
A pair of doors slides shut behind her, sealing her inside. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS993
01:49:09,00 --> 01:49:14,50
She packs supplies from nearby shelves. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS994
01:49:12,00 --> 01:49:17,50
SOMEONE halts and turns. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS995
01:49:14,00 --> 01:49:20,50
Her eyes wide, she looks over her shoulder at the doors. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS997
01:49:23,00 --> 01:49:28,50
Facing forward, she reaches into low tool compartment and takes out a fire ax with a curved handle. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS998
01:49:25,00 --> 01:49:31,50
Doors ahead open, revealing the devastated remains of SOMEONE quarters. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS999
01:49:28,00 --> 01:49:36,50
On the far end, the false windows show the video of the little girl playing the violin. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1000
01:49:33,00 --> 01:49:41,50
Broken hoses, tubes and wires dangle from the ceiling panel surrounding the chandelier. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1001
01:49:38,00 --> 01:49:44,50
SOMEONE shovels in, removes her helmet and sets it aside. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1003
01:49:49,00 --> 01:49:54,50
Sparks rain down erratically from the ceiling as she ventures past the bar, her axe ready, and approaches a doorway. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1004
01:49:51,00 --> 01:49:59,50
Pausing at its threshold, she raises the axe and gazes down a brief passageway ending in a sealed door with two small windows. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1005
01:49:56,00 --> 01:50:01,50
She precedes hesitantly. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1006
01:49:58,00 --> 01:50:03,50
Breathing through flared nostrils. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1007
01:50:01,00 --> 01:50:10,50
Wet with condensation, the doors windows show the med pod moving on its own in the flickering light. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1008
01:50:07,00 --> 01:50:13,50
SOMEONE leans her face close to the glass peering through. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1009
01:50:11,00 --> 01:50:17,50
As we watch her from the other side we find blood smearing the door. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1010
01:50:16,00 --> 01:50:25,50
A giant tentacle slaps against the glass. SOMEONE backs away, her mouth hanging open in a terrified stare. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1011
01:50:22,00 --> 01:50:30,50
The tentacle rubs persistently against the window then slides down the glass. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1012
01:50:42,00 --> 01:50:49,50
As SOMEONE turns, the remaining engineer forces a pair of side doors open and leans through. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1013
01:50:48,00 --> 01:50:53,50
Charging, he backs her against a wall. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1014
01:50:52,00 --> 01:51:03,50
She pounds a touchscreen, a tentacle shoots out through the med pod station doors lashes around the engineer's throat and tackles him, taking SOMEONE down with them. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1015
01:51:01,00 --> 01:51:09,50
As the creature wraps its tentacles around the engineer, she wriggles out from beneath them both. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1016
01:51:06,00 --> 01:51:13,50
A spare tentacle wraps around her ankle, but she kicks it lose and scrambles away. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1017
01:51:10,00 --> 01:51:16,50
The creature lifts the engineer off the floor. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1018
01:51:15,00 --> 01:51:22,50
Grabbing her helmet, SOMEONE rushes back to the airlock compartment. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1019
01:51:19,00 --> 01:51:27,50
In the lifeboat, the engineer struggles pitily against the grasp of the giant squid-like creature 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1020
01:51:24,00 --> 01:51:34,50
Flaps on its underside blossom outward like petals, revealing egg-shaped buds surrounding a vertical mouth lined with dagger-like teeth. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1022
01:51:35,00 --> 01:51:39,50
The engineer braces his legs against the door frame. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1024
01:51:41,00 --> 01:51:45,50
SOMEONE opens the air locked doors with her back and hand, then jumps out and lands in a hard roll. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1025
01:51:42,00 --> 01:51:49,50
In the lifeboat, the engineer snarls at the creature pulling him ever closer. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1026
01:51:46,00 --> 01:51:52,50
Yet another tentacle reaches out and wraps around his head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1027
01:51:50,00 --> 01:51:57,50
The buds shoot out tendrils that lash around his skull and hold him still. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1028
01:51:54,00 --> 01:52:01,50
The mouth launches a serpentine appendage down the engineer's throat. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1029
01:51:58,00 --> 01:52:04,50
It pulls him close, then lowers itself on top of him. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1030
01:52:02,00 --> 01:52:09,50
The giant squid-like creature wriggles around completely covering its prey. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1031
01:52:06,00 --> 01:52:12,50
It eventually relaxes and grows still. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1032
01:52:09,00 --> 01:52:16,50
Outside the sun peeks through thick rolling clouds. SOMEONE weeps on her back. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1033
01:52:51,00 --> 01:52:56,50
On the disc, SOMEONE's head sweats. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1034
01:53:26,00 --> 01:53:30,50
Outside SOMEONE lifts her head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1035
01:53:33,00 --> 01:53:38,50
Grimacing painfully, SOMEONE sits up. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1036
01:53:35,00 --> 01:53:42,50
Her gaze darts to a wrecked ATV half-buried in a mound of dirt. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1037
01:53:39,00 --> 01:53:45,50
In the ship, light wavers on SOMEONE's glistening face. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1038
01:53:43,00 --> 01:53:47,50
He listens uncertainly. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1040
01:53:45,00 --> 01:53:54,50
the ATV kicks up dust as SOMEONE drives it over the uneven terrain toward the engineer's crashed ship. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1042
01:53:52,00 --> 01:53:57,50
she steps into its dim cockpit. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1043
01:53:54,00 --> 01:53:58,50
Light flashes erratically. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1044
01:54:00,00 --> 01:54:08,50
A few feet from his head, SOMEONE's body twitches. SOMEONE steps closer and looms over them coldly. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1045
01:54:10,00 --> 01:54:17,50
SOMEONE puts down her bag and removes her protective space helmet. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1047
01:54:18,00 --> 01:54:23,50
Crouching at the android's body she rummages around and finds her cross. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1048
01:54:20,00 --> 01:54:24,50
Gazing tenderly at it, SOMEONE gently straightens the chain. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1049
01:54:22,00 --> 01:54:27,50
She solemnly puts it on over her head 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1050
01:54:24,00 --> 01:54:28,50
and gives a relieved sigh. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1051
01:54:26,00 --> 01:54:31,50
Looking on, SOMEONE smiles admiringly. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1052
01:54:38,00 --> 01:54:43,50
SOMEONE crouches over his head. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1053
01:54:59,00 --> 01:55:06,50
The android stares at her with parted lips. He clamps his mouth shut. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1054
01:55:07,00 --> 01:55:15,50
Now, SOMEONE uses a line and pulley to lower SOMEONE's body out of an opening in the ship's hull. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1055
01:55:12,00 --> 01:55:19,50
His head lies on the floor by her feet, gazing up at her placidly. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1056
01:55:30,00 --> 01:55:34,50
The body touches down gently. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1057
01:55:53,00 --> 01:56:02,50
SOMEONE picks up his head in both hands. SOMEONE gives her a childlike appreciative smile as she lowers him into her bag. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1058
01:56:01,00 --> 01:56:06,50
The wind musses his hairline. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1059
01:56:05,00 --> 01:56:11,50
SOMEONE zips the bag closed over his earnest gaze. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1060
01:56:08,00 --> 01:56:15,50
Wincing painfully she gets to her feet and hauls the bag up. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1061
01:56:12,00 --> 01:56:18,50
From the edge of the hull, she repels 20 feet to the ground. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1063
01:56:17,00 --> 01:56:23,50
the ATV travels away from the structure along the desert valley. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1064
01:56:26,00 --> 01:56:30,50
It approaches the next structure. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1065
01:56:42,00 --> 01:56:47,50
Now we ascend through clouds. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1066
01:56:52,00 --> 01:56:57,50
An engineer ship rises into view. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1067
01:56:54,00 --> 01:56:59,50
Flaring brilliantly it darts away. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1068
01:56:57,00 --> 01:57:03,50
Beyond the clouds, the ringed planet glows. Fade to black. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1069
01:57:04,00 --> 01:57:13,50
In the abandoned lifeboat the last engineer's body convulses on the floor, surrounded by the creature's motionless tentacles. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1070
01:57:11,00 --> 01:57:16,50
In the flickering pulsating light his chest bulges. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1071
01:57:15,00 --> 01:57:20,50
An exoskeletal point resembling a giant 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1072
01:57:18,00 --> 01:57:23,50
claw bursts out and slices through his sternum. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1073
01:57:20,00 --> 01:57:29,50
A skinny body with long limbs in a gleaming dark gray exoskeleton wriggles out of the hole and onto the floor. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1074
01:57:26,00 --> 01:57:32,50
A yellow amniotic sac pulsates beside it, 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1075
01:57:29,00 --> 01:57:35,50
connecting the newborn to the engineer's carcass. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1076
01:57:34,00 --> 01:57:46,50
The new alien specimen pushes itself up on all fours. It lifts its head which bears the oversized claw like growth as a sickle shaped head crest. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1077
01:57:44,00 --> 01:57:50,50
The alien straightens, sitting up on its heels and looks around. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1079
01:57:52,00 --> 01:57:57,50
It works its slavering jaws. 

PROMETHEUS_DVS1080
01:57:54,00 --> 01:57:59,50
A set of inner jaws pops out from its mouth.Its pink gums dripping slime.
