SOUL_SURFER_DVS17
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:50,50
Now standing together on one surfboard, the girls ride a gentle wave. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS21
00:03:35,00 --> 00:03:39,50
and grins as he spots the girl. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS26
00:05:24,00 --> 00:05:29,50
Sitting on her bed, SOMEONE gazes out a window as she plays her ukulele. A Shar-Pei rest its chin on her leg.  

SOUL_SURFER_DVS27
00:05:27,00 --> 00:05:38,50
Standing, SOMEONE eyes the waves outside then heads into the kitchen. SOMEONE fiddles with the video camera. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS28
00:05:48,00 --> 00:05:51,50
His eyes light up. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS30
00:10:10,00 --> 00:10:15,50
SOMEONE's father looks at his wife who nods. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS31
00:11:01,00 --> 00:11:05,50
Now in an awards podium.

00:11:47,00 --> 00:11:52,50

SOUL_SURFER_DVS34
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:04,50
SOMEONE holds the top over her eyes. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS35
00:12:11,00 --> 00:12:16,50
She eyes the price. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS37
00:12:21,00 --> 00:12:25,50
She eyes SOMEONE. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS38
00:12:26,00 --> 00:12:30,50
SOMEONE smirks. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS40
00:12:45,00 --> 00:12:52,50
Now, the young woman from the choir checks her watch as she heads toward a gazebo. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS41
00:12:53,00 --> 00:13:03,50
She beckons teens past a sign that reads, "Calvary Chapel." Nighttime. In the gazebo, the young woman shows an image on a TV. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS42
00:14:06,00 --> 00:14:10,50
SOMEONE carries over a box. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS44
00:14:34,00 --> 00:14:39,50
With a hard swallow, SOMEONE shifts her crestfallen eyes. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS45
00:14:37,00 --> 00:14:43,50
Morning. At the Hamilton's, SOMEONE's mother lifts a longboard. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS46
00:14:45,00 --> 00:14:51,50
She put longboard on pickup truck beside the van. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS47
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:52,50
As she loads boogie boards into the van's trunk. Rolling her eyes, SOMEONE strides off. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS49
00:15:57,00 --> 00:16:02,50
a forecast on surfline.com. SOMEONE enters. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS50
00:16:20,00 --> 00:16:25,50
They kiss in SOMEONE's room. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS51
00:16:45,00 --> 00:16:49,50
Now they run over to a red pick up. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS52
00:17:24,00 --> 00:17:28,50
SOMEONE climbs back on. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS53
00:17:32,00 --> 00:17:37,50
kicking legs again, he climbs back on. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS55
00:18:16,00 --> 00:18:21,50
Now, beyond palm trees the sun rises over the ocean. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS57
00:18:50,00 --> 00:18:54,50
SOMEONE grabs a snack. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS58
00:19:02,00 --> 00:19:07,50
SOMEONE gives her a thumbs up. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS61
00:22:21,00 --> 00:22:27,50

SOUL_SURFER_DVS62
00:23:34,00 --> 00:23:38,50
SOMEONE sprints through the banyan. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS63
00:23:38,00 --> 00:23:42,50
descend on the others as they cross. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS64
00:23:41,00 --> 00:23:44,50
and reaches the truck and yanks 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS66
00:23:51,00 --> 00:23:56,50
HE takes the cell from the vehicle, he dials a number. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS68
00:24:05,00 --> 00:24:09,50
HE sits up. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS69
00:24:10,00 --> 00:24:15,50
He watches the doctors step out. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS70
00:24:13,00 --> 00:24:18,50
They drag SOMEONE across the sand. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS71
00:24:22,00 --> 00:24:25,50
He puts a leash around SOMEONE's wound. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS73
00:24:36,00 --> 00:24:41,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE rolls SOMEONE. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS74
00:24:47,00 --> 00:24:54,50
SOMEONE's mother freezes. She drops the cordless phone and sprints across the room. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS75
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:10,50
Her vision blurred, the wounded girl sees each of their faces. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS78
00:26:16,00 --> 00:26:21,50
She notices the ambulance. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS79
00:26:38,00 --> 00:26:44,50
Now, Dr. SOMEONE enters the operating room. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS80
00:26:52,00 --> 00:26:58,50
He covers his eyes. In the ambulance, SOMEONE stares upward. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS81
00:27:11,00 --> 00:27:16,50
An oxygen mask over SOMEONE's mouth. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS82
00:27:25,00 --> 00:27:29,50
She shifts the minivan into Park. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS83
00:27:43,00 --> 00:27:50,50
Her vision blurred, SOMEONE watches SOMEONE and an EMT as they wheel her down a hallway. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS84
00:27:53,00 --> 00:28:15,50
Rounding a corner, SOMEONE's spots her father. SOMEONE sits up on his bed and stumbles to a railing. A nurse holds him back. The EMTs wheeled the wounded girl into the operating room. A nurse keeps SOMEONE and SOMEONE from entering. As the EMTs set SOMEONE on a bed, the nurse shuts the door. SOMEONE holds the defibrillator to the girl's chest inside. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS87
00:28:31,00 --> 00:28:43,50
she gazes ahead, lips parted. Bright golden light gleams into the hallow wave and shines on the girl's face. She blinks. Surfing toward it. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS88
00:28:41,00 --> 00:28:47,50
appears ahead. Surrounded by light, SOMEONE looks at right. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS89
00:28:46,00 --> 00:28:50,50
The white light dissolves. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS90
00:28:48,00 --> 00:29:01,50
hospital room where her family waits by her bed. SOMEONE leans at a window, SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit in chairs at the foot of the bed, and SOMEONE sits at her side. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS91
00:29:04,00 --> 00:29:08,50
SOMEONE slides her right hand. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS92
00:32:08,00 --> 00:32:12,50
Father who reads a Bible. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS93
00:33:34,00 --> 00:33:38,50
SOMEONE drops his fork. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS94
00:33:49,00 --> 00:33:53,50
SOMEONE's legs writhe under. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS95
00:33:54,00 --> 00:34:00,50

SOUL_SURFER_DVS103
00:36:22,00 --> 00:36:27,50
SOMEONE looks at her mother and they share a smile. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS104
00:36:26,00 --> 00:36:37,50
She turns her attention to the side of the road where a series of propped up surfboards read, "Welcome home SOMEONE. We love you." 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS105
00:36:40,00 --> 00:36:44,50
Now, reporters and cameramen. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS107
00:37:19,00 --> 00:37:24,50
SOMEONE sits behind the wheel. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS108
00:37:38,00 --> 00:37:44,50
SOMEONE hurry around to open her door. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS110
00:37:54,00 --> 00:38:00,50
She share a look, then SOMEONE watches the kids head inside. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS111
00:38:18,00 --> 00:38:25,50
Inside, SOMEONE and her brothers look out a window. The photographers snap pictures. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS112
00:38:31,00 --> 00:38:36,50
Her parents come inside.

SOMEONE takes a package of deli meat from the refrigerator. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS118
00:39:24,00 --> 00:39:33,50

SOUL_SURFER_DVS120
00:39:46,00 --> 00:39:53,50
The shark-bite survivor pensively touches the instrument then picks it up. Cradling it in 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS121
00:39:52,00 --> 00:39:56,50
her arm, she plucks the strings with her thumb. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS122
00:40:02,00 --> 00:40:07,50
SOMEONE sets the ukulele back on the bureau.

00:40:55,00 --> 00:40:59,50
Later, the family sits at a table. SOMEONE starts to eat. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS126
00:40:59,00 --> 00:41:04,50
Her mother regards her with wide eyes. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS129

SOUL_SURFER_DVS130
00:41:56,00 --> 00:42:02,50
knocking a price marker down and upsetting some loose apples. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS131
00:42:01,00 --> 00:42:06,50
Later, she carries a brown paper bag to her bicycle 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS132
00:42:05,00 --> 00:42:10,50
an assortment of fruit tumbles into her. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS133
00:42:09,00 --> 00:42:13,50
a girl watches nearby. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS134
00:42:15,00 --> 00:42:19,50
Her mother faces SOMEONE. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS135
00:42:18,00 --> 00:42:23,50
At the hospital, SOMEONE sits on a exam table. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS136
00:42:28,00 --> 00:42:33,50
SOMEONE's mother smiles and nods to Dr. SOMEONE. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS139
00:42:54,00 --> 00:42:58,50
Her lips pressed to a thin 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS141
00:43:17,00 --> 00:43:22,50
mother steps close watching her. SOMEONE faces 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS142
00:43:23,00 --> 00:43:27,50
her mother nods encouragingly. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS143
00:43:33,00 --> 00:43:38,50
The mother shakes her head then bursts into tears. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS144
00:43:36,00 --> 00:43:41,50
Her husband draws her into a comforting embrace. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS147
00:45:46,00 --> 00:45:50,50
SOMEONE's brow furrowed. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS148
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:05,50
Her brother carries SOMEONE's shark-bitten surfboard under one arm. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS149
00:46:04,00 --> 00:46:09,50
Bystanders gather around. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS150
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:18,50
SOMEONE takes the surfboard from his son. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS152
00:46:22,00 --> 00:46:28,50
He positions the surfboard's bite-gap around its jaws. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS154

Letting the surfboard drop, SOMEONE lays a hand. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS155
00:46:35,00 --> 00:46:41,50
SOMEONE takes up the board and rubs his father's shoulder. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS156
00:46:44,00 --> 00:46:48,50
Starring at the animal's jag. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS157
00:46:51,00 --> 00:47:02,50
with the shark's long gleaming body. SOMEONE gazes after the father as he follows his sons away. At home, SOMEONE lies wide awake in bed. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS159
00:47:02,00 --> 00:47:11,50
some boys watch excitedly as the bikini-clad SOMEONE poses with a pink surfboard for a professional photographer. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS160
00:47:58,00 --> 00:48:02,50
Assistants hold towels up around. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS165
00:49:25,00 --> 00:49:30,50
Later, she carries it out. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS166
00:49:51,00 --> 00:49:55,50
Induced, her father pauses then 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS167
00:49:54,00 --> 00:50:04,50
As SOMEONE faces her parents with a hopeful smile they swap looks, then beam proudly at her. Now on a beach, SOMEONE points his video. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS168
00:50:03,00 --> 00:50:09,50
Behind him, SOMEONE and his family stand with surfboards. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS169
00:50:15,00 --> 00:50:19,50
Now, SOMEONE looks back at SOMEONE. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS170
00:50:20,00 --> 00:50:27,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE trot down to the water. SOMEONE hesitantly follows. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS173
00:52:47,00 --> 00:52:51,50
She steps in close. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS175
00:53:41,00 --> 00:53:48,50
Left alone with SOMEONE, SOMEONE soberly steps closer to him. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS176
00:53:57,00 --> 00:54:07,50
Daytime. On a table on a grassy overlook, a man in a suit opens a case to reveal a realistic prosthetic arm. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS177
00:54:08,00 --> 00:54:13,50
Filmed by a TV crew, SOMEONE glances at her parents. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS179
00:54:29,00 --> 00:54:33,50
Her brothers watch. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS180
00:54:39,00 --> 00:54:47,50
As her parents watch, SOMEONE lays a short board across the table and starts to lean down. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS181
00:55:26,00 --> 00:55:34,50
SOMEONE calls after SOMEONE as she runs toward the house. SOMEONE hurries after her. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS182
00:55:32,00 --> 00:55:44,50
girl flops down on her bed, her head at its foot. She holds up a Barbie doll. Bracing it between her legs, she brushes the doll's hair back then snaps off the left arm. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS183
00:55:44,00 --> 00:55:50,50
SOMEONE turns her head and finds her mother watching compassionately from a few feet away. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS184
00:55:58,00 --> 00:56:03,50
gaze fixed on the modified doll as her mother looks down at her. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS185
00:56:05,00 --> 00:56:10,50
She lets it drop to her chest and blinks back tears. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS186
00:57:26,00 --> 00:57:32,50
Now, SOMEONE plants a row of surfboards in the sand according to size 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS187
00:57:34,00 --> 00:57:40,50
from a round-ended longboard to a four-foot tapered short board. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS188
00:59:07,00 --> 00:59:10,50
He slices a banana. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS189
00:59:09,00 --> 00:59:14,50
Sitting at a nearby computer, SOMEONE turns and watches her. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS190
01:00:33,00 --> 01:00:38,50
SOMEONE goes to a registration table. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS191
01:00:39,00 --> 01:00:45,50
SOMEONE arrives, turns in a form and takes a gray t-shirt. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS192
01:00:45,00 --> 01:00:52,50
SOMEONE moves off with a sneer. Later, an official approaches SOMEONE. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS194
01:01:05,00 --> 01:01:10,50
She glowers at SOMEONE. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS199
01:06:06,00 --> 01:06:13,50
SOMEONE stops SOMEONE who peers after his daughter. In a parking lot, 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS200
01:06:15,00 --> 01:06:20,50
SOMEONE gazes willfully at the three eager girls. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS201
01:06:21,00 --> 01:06:28,50
She lowers the tailgate of her parents' truck, her lips set in a bitter frown. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS203
01:06:42,00 --> 01:06:46,50
She give the third girl her last board. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS204
01:06:46,00 --> 01:06:57,50
With a disappointed look, SOMEONE watches his daughter climb into the truck's extended cab. As she closes the door, her brothers pile into the backseat with her. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS205
01:06:56,00 --> 01:07:00,50
She looks at his father through the open window. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS206
01:07:04,00 --> 01:07:17,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE grimly face forward. As SOMEONE props her cheek on her hand, SOMEONE watches her solemnly. Now in his backyard workshop, SOMEONE drills a hole in a surfboard. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS207
01:08:07,00 --> 01:08:15,50
As she holds SOMEONE's hands, his eyes fill with tears and his lips tremble. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS208
01:08:16,00 --> 01:08:20,50
Huge shafts of light beam through patches among the clouds. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS210
01:08:21,00 --> 01:08:28,50
SOMEONE trudges up to his daughter. As he sits beside her, she shifts her gaze away 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS211
01:08:33,00 --> 01:08:39,50
She stares off blankly. SOMEONE glances at her. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS212
01:08:48,00 --> 01:08:52,50
She regards him. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS213
01:08:50,00 --> 01:08:55,50
She shifts her tearful gaze away. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS214
01:09:06,00 --> 01:09:11,50
She shrugs. SOMEONE closes his eyes. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS215
01:09:13,00 --> 01:09:18,50
Her lips pout helplessly. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS217
01:09:41,00 --> 01:09:47,50
opens his mouth to speak. He lifts his brow then meets her gaze. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS218
01:10:01,00 --> 01:10:06,50
SOMEONE shrugs. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS221
01:10:20,00 --> 01:10:26,50
On another day, SOMEONE leads a youth group into an airport. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS223
01:10:35,00 --> 01:10:42,50
The blonde teen stands and gives her older friend a tentative smile. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS224
01:10:41,00 --> 01:10:46,50
SOMEONE mugs a comical frown. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS225
01:10:46,00 --> 01:10:51,50
She grins and SOMEONE 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS226
01:10:48,00 --> 01:10:55,50
She hugs her. The pleased surfer beams at her fellow volunteer group. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS230
01:11:12,00 --> 01:11:18,50
The supply helicopter passes overhead. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS232
01:11:41,00 --> 01:11:51,50
Inside SOMEONE observes a young woman holding a baby goat in her arms. The dispirited woman stares back, her gaze broken. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS233
01:11:53,00 --> 01:12:08,50
The bus halts a short distance from the aid tent and the youth group climbs off. Makeshift tents line the muddy road filled with foot traffic. A family tends to some goats. A desolate man carries a water jug like a suitcase. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS234
01:12:06,00 --> 01:12:15,50
As SOMEONE takes in her surroundings, SOMEONE glances over her shoulder, her stricken expression mirroring the team. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS235
01:12:14,00 --> 01:12:18,50
She addresses the group. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS236
01:12:18,00 --> 01:12:31,50
She leads them back up the road, past a steady stream of people trudging in the opposite direction. Farther along the road at a dusty supply vehicle, a blonde woman beckons workers. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS237
01:12:36,00 --> 01:12:40,50
approaches with her group. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS238
01:12:53,00 --> 01:12:58,50
Rosemary gives a sack of grain to SOMEONE. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS239
01:12:57,00 --> 01:13:04,50
Forming a line, the youth group members pass down the sacks one at a time. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS240
01:13:02,00 --> 01:13:11,50
SOMEONE catches each in the crook of her arm then heaves it into SOMEONE's arms. SOMEONE smiles. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS241
01:13:10,00 --> 01:13:14,50
She bandages it. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS242
01:13:20,00 --> 01:13:24,50
The wounded woman addresses SOMEONE. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS243
01:13:48,00 --> 01:13:52,50
Her gaze meets SOMEONE's. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS244
01:13:55,00 --> 01:14:02,50
She turns from the woman and walks a short distance away, her chest heaving. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS245
01:14:01,00 --> 01:14:10,50
briefly holds her own face as she breaks into sobs but tears slides down her cheek. SOMEONE approaches. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS246
01:14:21,00 --> 01:14:25,50
SOMEONE blinks back her tears. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS247
01:14:29,00 --> 01:14:55,50
SOMEONE nods. She wipes tears from her face as SOMEONE returns to the first aid table. Gazing at the ravaged town, she struggles to remain composed. Her eyes pool again and her chin trembles. Later, a volunteer passes by carrying a box of soccer balls. Several preteen locals wait before a table where SOMEONE and SOMEONE ladle chicken noodle soup into bowls. SOMEONE grins at some children. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS248
01:14:57,00 --> 01:15:06,50
On a beach, children sit on the sand amid a small tent city. A boy pulls a little girl on a boogie board. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS249
01:15:04,00 --> 01:15:12,50
SOMEONE hands SOMEONE shrink-wrapped bottled water. SOMEONE takes two bottles and hands some out to the kids. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS250
01:15:11,00 --> 01:15:17,50
The gift surfboards rest on a beached boat. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS251
01:15:20,00 --> 01:15:27,50
SOMEONE picks up a ponytailed little boy who pokes the stub of SOMEONE's missing arm. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS252
01:15:36,00 --> 01:15:43,50
SOMEONE rubs his chest then sits him down. SOMEONE taps his arm. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS253
01:15:42,00 --> 01:15:47,50
She points at the waves. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS254
01:15:48,00 --> 01:16:01,50
He jogs away. As SOMEONE stares after him, the little boy hurries towards a dune covered with fallen palm fronds. SOMEONE approaches a boy who stands on one the donated surfboards. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS256
01:16:13,00 --> 01:16:21,50
SOMEONE carries the board to the water's edge. She glances over her shoulder at the little boy. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS257
01:16:23,00 --> 01:16:28,50
The girl shakes his head. She steps into the water and splashes it.  

SOUL_SURFER_DVS258
01:16:27,00 --> 01:16:32,50
She pretends to ride a surfboard. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS263
01:17:03,00 --> 01:17:09,50
As SOMEONE carries the board. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS264
01:17:08,00 --> 01:17:13,50
SOMEONE sets the board down. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS265
01:17:10,00 --> 01:17:17,50
She walks over to the little boy who shoots her an uncertain look. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS266
01:17:17,00 --> 01:17:21,50
Her eyes flickered. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS268
01:17:54,00 --> 01:17:58,50
Bystanders clap. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS269
01:18:05,00 --> 01:18:09,50
grinning as she glides away. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS270
01:18:27,00 --> 01:18:34,50
Now piles of mail cover tables and countertops in the Hamilton home. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS271
01:19:29,00 --> 01:19:35,50
Outside in his workshop SOMEONE uses a strip of plastic to shape. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS272
01:19:35,00 --> 01:19:38,50
SOMEONE strides over. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS273
01:19:38,00 --> 01:19:42,50
She smiles faintly. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS274
01:19:45,00 --> 01:19:49,50
His lips spread into a smile. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS275
01:19:52,00 --> 01:19:57,50
Straightening, SOMEONE folds his arms, 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS276
01:20:04,00 --> 01:20:09,50
reaches into the rafters on the workshop's roof. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS277
01:20:07,00 --> 01:20:12,50
He pulls down a surfboard. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS278
01:20:10,00 --> 01:20:17,50
He grips a rope handle across the board's midline a few feet from its nose. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS279
01:20:17,00 --> 01:20:20,50
SOMEONE beams and he hands her 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS281
01:20:27,00 --> 01:20:32,50
under the churning water, SOMEONE surfaced Beach.  

SOUL_SURFER_DVS282
01:20:37,00 --> 01:20:42,50
Pushing out a tired breath, SOMEONE paddles on. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS283
01:20:47,00 --> 01:20:52,50
Arms folded, SOMEONE returns his gaze to the surf. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS284
01:20:53,00 --> 01:20:57,50
His sons grin. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS285
01:21:20,00 --> 01:21:24,50
SOMEONE glances away. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS287
01:21:47,00 --> 01:21:51,50
she pushups as her dad helps. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS288
01:22:22,00 --> 01:22:26,50
pushups on her own. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS289
01:22:26,00 --> 01:22:30,50
SOMEONE jogs over. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS290
01:22:41,00 --> 01:22:46,50
SOMEONE regards her friend thoughtfully. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS291
01:23:00,00 --> 01:23:05,50
They fought playful shoves. SOMEONE falls. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS295
01:24:33,00 --> 01:24:37,50
SOMEONE answers with a thoughtful nod. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS296
01:24:45,00 --> 01:24:51,50
The teen nods. Her father kisses and hugs her. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS297
01:25:09,00 --> 01:25:13,50
SOMEONE throws an arm around SOMEONE. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS298
01:25:29,00 --> 01:25:33,50
who wears an unsettled gaze. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS299
01:26:03,00 --> 01:26:08,50
SOMEONE stands up to watch SOMEONE hook a wave.  

SOUL_SURFER_DVS300
01:26:09,00 --> 01:26:13,50
A judge jots the names for the semifinals. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS302
01:26:25,00 --> 01:26:30,50
An official adds SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS303
01:27:37,00 --> 01:27:41,50
The impact zone, the girls duck dived. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS304
01:29:35,00 --> 01:29:39,50
the wave engulfs SOMEONE. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS306
01:31:40,00 --> 01:31:43,50
A clad of surfers surfaces 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS307
01:32:31,00 --> 01:32:35,50
the timer shows less than two minutes. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS308
01:32:34,00 --> 01:32:38,50
paddles over to the other finalists as they gaze. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS309
01:32:38,00 --> 01:33:00,50
upon her board and scans the ocean. The timer counts down past a minute and 45 seconds. The ocean seems to stretch endlessly around the surfers without a hint of a wave. SOMEONE waits desperately. As we peer up at her board from underwater, her legs kick out widely at its sides. Leaving the other surfers, she paddles farther out to sea. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS310
01:33:18,00 --> 01:33:26,50
SOMEONE's silhouette glides across the sparkling water. SOMEONE paddles after her. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS311
01:33:31,00 --> 01:33:39,50
SOMEONE stops paddling and sits up, peering through narrowed eyes at the rolling water. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS312
01:33:47,00 --> 01:33:57,50
She caresses the ocean's surface with her hand. From underwater, we peer up at it through dappled rays of sunlight. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS313
01:34:00,00 --> 01:34:09,50
A few yards ahead a wave appears and quickly swells. SOMEONE smiles to herself and paddles toward it. On 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS314
01:34:10,00 --> 01:34:15,50
its side it looms over us, eclipsing the sun. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS315
01:34:24,00 --> 01:34:31,50
A judge readies the air horn and consults a stopwatch. The timer ticks past five. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS317
01:34:51,00 --> 01:34:58,50
On the still water, SOMEONE watches soberly. From the beach, 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS318
01:34:56,00 --> 01:35:03,50
SOMEONE looks on with a furrowed brow. His little sister sends up a spring. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS319
01:35:03,00 --> 01:35:08,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE stand close, watching intently. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS320
01:35:07,00 --> 01:35:11,50
From the water, the wave curls over 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS321
01:35:11,00 --> 01:35:16,50
Crouches as she rides through the swirling spiral of water.  

SOUL_SURFER_DVS322
01:35:20,00 --> 01:35:31,50
She keeps just ahead of the barrel as it closes behind her. Her parents anxiously wait for her to reappear. She surfs toward us. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS324
01:36:40,00 --> 01:36:45,50
She gives a satisfied grin. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS325
01:36:43,00 --> 01:36:49,50
SOMEONE beams proudly and cups her cheek in his hand. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS326
01:36:47,00 --> 01:36:52,50
He plants a kiss on her forehead. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS327
01:36:52,00 --> 01:36:57,50
As he steps away, SOMEONE beams after him. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS328
01:36:58,00 --> 01:37:04,50
just carry her on their shoulders, SOMEONE joins her mother. 

SOUL_SURFER_DVS329
01:37:12,00 --> 01:37:17,50
SOMEONE smiles and shakes her head.
