Billowing black smoke, the sea plane lands on the ocean surface in the distance. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS324
00:50:21,00 --> 00:50:29,50
SOMEONE hops into the water besides SOMEONE as two men climb out of the plane and on to one of its pontoons.

He aims his gun. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS328
00:50:52,00 --> 00:50:58,50
Later crammed into the plane with SOMEONE and the pilots SOMEONE reads a flight manual. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS329
00:51:04,00 --> 00:51:10,50
Sitting in the cockpit SOMEONE pulls a knob and starts the plane. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS330
00:51:13,00 --> 00:51:18,50
Snowy sticks his head out of a window as the plane picks up speed. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS331
00:51:16,00 --> 00:51:21,50

The plane flies unsteadily toward a massive storm front. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS334
00:52:00,00 --> 00:52:06,50
Forks of lightning flash from the thunderhead as the small plane flies into it. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS335
00:52:04,00 --> 00:52:10,50

00:52:17,00 --> 00:52:21,50
He reaches for a bottle.

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS342
00:52:42,00 --> 00:52:49,50
A globule of clear alcohol floats out of the bottle and hovers in front of SOMEONE's face. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS343
00:52:55,00 --> 00:53:01,50

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS347
00:53:08,00 --> 00:53:13,50
A large globule of alcohol rises out of the bottle. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS348
00:53:11,00 --> 00:53:18,50

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS349
00:53:18,00 --> 00:53:25,50
The plane pulls out of the dive just a few feet above the ocean surface and arises into the air. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS351
00:53:43,00 --> 00:53:50,50
SOMEONE straps on a parachute. He opens the plane's side door, looks down and shuts the door again. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS352
00:53:58,00 --> 00:54:04,50
Setting his jaw, SOMEONE opens the door and slips outside. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS353
00:54:01,00 --> 00:54:05,50
The wind carries him away. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS354
00:54:11,00 --> 00:54:15,50

Straddling the engine, SOMEONE opens the gas tank, 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS358
00:54:32,00 --> 00:54:36,50
then beats a fist on his chest. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS359
00:54:34,00 --> 00:54:39,50
He places his mouth over the gas tank spout. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS361
00:54:43,00 --> 00:54:47,50
The engine sparks to life. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS362

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS365
00:55:06,00 --> 00:55:16,50
In the back, one of the captured pilots frees himself, then unties his partner. The plane rises over another dune revealing as vast desert filled with wrecked ships and planes. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS366
00:55:16,00 --> 00:55:22,50
A bolt of lightning strikes SOMEONE who flips onto the plane's wings. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS367
00:55:19,00 --> 00:55:26,50
His parachute opens and drags him backward, but he clings to the plane's tail. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS368
00:55:23,00 --> 00:55:31,50
The two pilots jump out of the plane, and, opening parachutes, drift safely onto the sand below. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS369
00:55:29,00 --> 00:55:35,50
SOMEONE loses his grip on the tail and lands face first in a powdery dune.

SOMEONE hugs Snowy to his chest, 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS371
00:55:34,00 --> 00:55:40,50
and ducks down as the plane bounces over a sand dune, flips and crashes. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS372
00:55:39,00 --> 00:55:46,50
SOMEONE smashes through the front windshield and sprawls across the hood, inches behind the spinning propeller. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS373
00:55:44,00 --> 00:55:48,50
Snowy tugs on his unconscious master.

SOMEONE slides toward the spinning blades. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS375
00:55:53,00 --> 00:55:59,50
An updraft lifts SOMEONE's parachute and carries him of his feet. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS376
00:56:00,00 --> 00:56:06,50
Kicking his legs he drops onto the back of the plane as it pitches forward. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS377
00:56:03,00 --> 00:56:09,50
Sliding SOMEONE even closer to the whirring propeller.

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS380
00:56:21,00 --> 00:56:32,50
The propeller snags Haddocks parachute, spins him around rapidly several times and spits him onto the sand nearby. The propeller slows to a stop then drops off. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS381
00:56:30,00 --> 00:56:37,50
With their arms around each other's shoulders, SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk across a desert 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS382
00:56:35,00 --> 00:56:40,50
of rolling sand dunes as Snowy trods ahead of them. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS383
00:56:48,00 --> 00:56:52,50
SOMEONE drops to his knees. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS384
00:57:06,00 --> 00:57:10,50

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS390
00:57:40,00 --> 00:57:44,50
SOMEONE slowly stands. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS391
00:57:55,00 --> 00:58:00,50
Snowy drags a large bone then drops it. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS392
00:58:11,00 --> 00:58:16,50
As SOMEONE gazes over the rolling desert, a ship's mast 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS393
00:58:14,00 --> 00:58:18,50
seemed to rise over the horizon. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS394
00:58:16,00 --> 00:58:21,50
The skies darken and the sands turns to ocean, 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS395
00:58:19,00 --> 00:58:23,50
as the Unicorn crashes toward them. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS396
00:58:28,00 --> 00:58:37,50
On the deck of the ship Sir SOMEONE peers through a spyglass as the Unicorn sails through a rough sea. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS397
00:58:53,00 --> 00:58:58,50
Shutters open along the side of the ship, revealing cannons. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS398
00:58:58,00 --> 00:59:02,50
Sailors man battle stations. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS399
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:18,50
The helmsman turns the ship's wheel. An approaching pirate ship fires cannon balls, 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS400
00:59:16,00 --> 00:59:22,50
which zip through huge ocean swills and strike the Unicorn's bow. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS401
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:25,50
Flames burn inside the Unicorn as its cannons return fire. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS402
00:59:25,00 --> 00:59:29,50
The pirate ship fires a volley. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS403
00:59:26,00 --> 00:59:35,50
The cannon ball tears through a sail and setting it on fire. Sir SOMEONE marches through his ship as men and cannons 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS404
00:59:32,00 --> 00:59:36,50
explode behind him. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS405
00:59:33,00 --> 00:59:39,50
The two ships, both on fire, sail toward each other, then crash together. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS406
00:59:44,00 --> 00:59:50,50
As lightning flashes one ship tips over, then rights itself. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS407
00:59:53,00 --> 00:59:58,50
The rigging of the burning ships entangles. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS408
00:59:56,00 --> 01:00:02,50
As the Unicorn tips to one side, it lifts the other ship out of the water. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS409
00:59:59,00 --> 01:00:06,50
Suspended by the Unicorn's rigging, the pirate ship swings over the Unicorn's deck.

Night falls over the vast desert. A shooting star zooms across the sky. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS430
01:02:30,00 --> 01:02:34,50
Snowy stands on a ridge and barks. 

THE_ADVENTURES_OF_TINTIN_DVS431
01:02:32,00 --> 01:02:37,50
