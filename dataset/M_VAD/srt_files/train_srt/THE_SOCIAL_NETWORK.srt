THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS4
00:05:26,00 --> 00:05:35,50
Now, SOMEONE exits the Thirsty Scholar Pub into the night. Titles. Columbia Pictures presents. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS5
00:05:35,00 --> 00:05:41,50
Now, a stately brick facade inset with white pilasters. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS9
00:06:03,00 --> 00:06:10,50
Opposite the building, SOMEONE passes under its overhang. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS10
00:06:10,00 --> 00:06:20,50
SOMEONE trots alongside a brick wall as he carries a backpack over one shoulder. Passing other pedestrians, he continues down a campus 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS15
00:06:51,00 --> 00:06:56,50
He walks along another walkway to a flight of stone steps. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS20
00:07:29,00 --> 00:07:37,50
SOMEONE crosses through a second columned walkway ascending then descending its step. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS21
00:07:37,00 --> 00:07:46,50
Hand stuffed in the pocket of his gray hooded sweatshirt, the young man hurries toward one of the warmly lit brick buildings and heads up a few step. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS22
00:07:48,00 --> 00:07:52,50
As he goes inside. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS23
00:07:51,00 --> 00:07:56,50
Molding, Kirkland House. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS25
00:07:59,00 --> 00:08:03,50
Then enters a bedroom where he flipped his laptop. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS26
00:08:02,00 --> 00:08:07,50
He shares the screen on a separate computer monitor. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS27
00:08:05,00 --> 00:08:10,50
It's a small refrigerator and grabs a bottle of beer. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS28
00:08:11,00 --> 00:08:17,50
8:13 PM, SOMEONE sits at his desk. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS29
00:08:24,00 --> 00:08:30,50
Reading his blog post, he sips his beer. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS30
00:08:38,00 --> 00:08:45,50
He posts the entry, the image darkens. 9:48 PM. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS31
00:08:48,00 --> 00:08:57,50
He removes the keyboard from a drawer and sets it on the desk, then sips his beer. A dorm mate enters with a six-pack. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS32
00:09:14,00 --> 00:09:22,50
We float down an aisle between seated college girls. The image briefly darkens. 10:17 PM. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS33
00:09:42,00 --> 00:09:45,50
He cracks his knuckles. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS34
00:10:15,00 --> 00:10:18,50
It shows the group and the young women. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS38
00:10:57,00 --> 00:11:03,50
Door toward a few club members. Back with SOMEONE. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS40
00:11:16,00 --> 00:11:20,50
the partiers dance. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS42
00:11:55,00 --> 00:12:02,50
Outside Kirkland House, a dark haired young man hurries up the steps and scans his key card at the door. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS43
00:12:01,00 --> 00:12:12,50
In his room SOMEONE tosses a green-tailed dart to SOMEONE, which lands in his friend's Screwdriver. Meanwhile, the dark-haired young man heads upstairs. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS44
00:12:35,00 --> 00:12:40,50
SOMEONE notes his webpage. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS45
00:12:44,00 --> 00:12:49,50
SOMEONE writes on the window. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS46
00:13:07,00 --> 00:13:11,50
As two young women make out. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS47
00:13:32,00 --> 00:13:36,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS48
00:13:40,00 --> 00:13:44,50
Heated young men. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS50
00:14:19,00 --> 00:14:23,50
Three girls have a look. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS51
00:14:28,00 --> 00:14:34,50
While her friend sits at a desk. She looks over from her laptop. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS52
00:14:35,00 --> 00:14:39,50
SOMEONE joins her friend at her desk. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS53
00:14:37,00 --> 00:14:41,50
As they read, two guys barged. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS55
00:15:07,00 --> 00:15:15,50
SOMEONE glances at him while SOMEONE spins in a chair. Now in a bedroom, an older couple sleeps. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS57
00:15:43,00 --> 00:15:47,50
In SOMEONE's dorm. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS58
00:15:46,00 --> 00:15:50,50
On screen, the data window goes dark. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS59
00:15:51,00 --> 00:15:55,50
SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS61
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:04,50
Bashes his own head. SOMEONE grins. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS62
00:16:06,00 --> 00:16:10,50
SOMEONE smirks. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS63
00:16:13,00 --> 00:16:18,50
Now at a deposition with multiple lawyers. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS64
00:16:51,00 --> 00:17:03,50
SOMEONE's attorney steps away. The blonde attorney and SOMEONE beside her both get up. SOMEONE's attorney steps out. A brunette woman with shoulder length hair regards SOMEONE. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS65
00:17:10,00 --> 00:17:14,50
She faces forward. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS66
00:17:16,00 --> 00:17:24,50
Near a calm riverside, four two-men crews row their boats along the misty water. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS67
00:17:22,00 --> 00:17:27,50
They pass under a bridge followed by a small motor boat. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS68
00:17:25,00 --> 00:17:29,50
On one boat, a young man glanced. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS69
00:17:32,00 --> 00:17:39,50
A fifth boat leads the pack, 50 yards ahead. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS70
00:17:54,00 --> 00:18:00,50
They row through the low-lying mist, leaving the other boats far behind. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS71
00:20:14,00 --> 00:20:22,50
The head of security blinks, his smile fading. Later, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE waiting outside. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS73
00:21:11,00 --> 00:21:16,50
SOMEONE glances around, then stands. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS75
00:21:34,00 --> 00:21:38,50
The twins block his path. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS76
00:22:10,00 --> 00:22:16,50
Cameron leads SOMEONE and his brother onward. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS77
00:22:20,00 --> 00:22:25,50
A dark-haired young man waits in the bike room. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS78
00:22:40,00 --> 00:22:45,50
The sandwich to SOMEONE, who stares at photos on a wall. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS79
00:23:05,00 --> 00:23:09,50
The programming whiz shrugs. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS80
00:23:20,00 --> 00:23:26,50
The brother swap grins as SOMEONE studies SOMEONE soberly. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS81
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:05,50
The club members trade quizzical looks. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS82
00:24:14,00 --> 00:24:18,50
SOMEONE shoulders his bag. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS83
00:24:20,00 --> 00:24:24,50
Back in the present. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS84
00:25:44,00 --> 00:25:48,50
SOMEONE nod. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS86
00:26:36,00 --> 00:26:47,50
SOMEONE grins and follows SOMEONE outside into an alley. Wearing shorts, he briefly hugs himself then hops around and faces his warmly dressed friend. SOMEONE leans against him. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS87
00:27:18,00 --> 00:27:22,50
We flash to the deposition. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS88
00:28:04,00 --> 00:28:09,50
Back in the present. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS90
00:28:53,00 --> 00:29:01,50
SOMEONE's lawyer smirks and SOMEONE blinks incredulously. In the flashback. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS91
00:28:59,00 --> 00:29:06,50
In another deposition, SOMEONE and his lawyer share a table. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS92
00:29:03,00 --> 00:29:08,50
twins, SOMEONE, and their attorney. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS93
00:30:15,00 --> 00:30:20,50
Flashback show time passing. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS94
00:30:58,00 --> 00:31:03,50
With SOMEONE and the twins. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS95
00:31:03,00 --> 00:31:07,50
In SOMEONE's room. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS96
00:31:07,00 --> 00:31:35,50
A call on his cellphone. An envelope slides under the bottom of his door. SOMEONE sits down his things, scoots away from his desk and stands. He treads toward the envelope then hesitates. The young man picks it up and stares at his name on the front, then flips it over and finds a wax seal over the flap. He touches his forehead and pumps a fist. Spinning around, he takes a seat and opens it. Now in his room, SOMEONE works. Several dry erase boards with notes and plans on them stand around him. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS97
00:31:48,00 --> 00:31:54,50
SOMEONE bites his lips, then looks up resolutely. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS98
00:31:53,00 --> 00:31:59,50
Drops his gaze then smiles and swings his arms. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS99
00:31:59,00 --> 00:32:03,50
He shows the envelope. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS100
00:32:07,00 --> 00:32:15,50
SOMEONE blinks and gives a wounded nod. SOMEONE takes a seat at his desk and focuses on his work. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS101
00:32:39,00 --> 00:32:47,50
In a flashback. SOMEONE shows the twins an e-mail. Now, Phoenix pledges stand in the cold. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS102
00:33:01,00 --> 00:33:05,50
A guy strips in the snow. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS103
00:33:19,00 --> 00:33:26,50
A pledge pukes. Back in the deposition with the twin's attorney. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS104
00:33:48,00 --> 00:33:55,50
SOMEONE takes notes on a page covered in doodles. In a flashback. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS105
00:33:53,00 --> 00:33:58,50
Cameron checks his cell. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS106
00:34:07,00 --> 00:34:11,50
Back in the twins deposition. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS107
00:34:54,00 --> 00:35:00,50
In a flashback, SOMEONE joins SOMEONE in a computer lab. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS108
00:35:05,00 --> 00:35:10,50
SOMEONE stares blankly. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS109
00:35:20,00 --> 00:35:27,50
SOMEONE's jaw drops. He hits escape on the computer and grabs his bag. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS110
00:35:29,00 --> 00:35:35,50
Leaving SOMEONE with a puzzled look. SOMEONE jogs downstairs. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS111
00:35:33,00 --> 00:35:37,50
Shoves the door open and darts out. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS112
00:35:37,00 --> 00:35:42,50
He high steps through the thick snow on the ground and runs onward. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS113
00:35:40,00 --> 00:35:49,50
Now, SOMEONE hurries down a dorm corridor, clutching the strap of his backpack. He trots upstairs. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS114
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:11,50
SOMEONE follows SOMEONE in. The programmer plops down before his computer and types frantically. He pauses thoughtfully then continues. SOMEONE peeks at his work. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS115
00:36:56,00 --> 00:37:01,50
SOMEONE glances solemnly at his friend. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS116
00:37:11,00 --> 00:37:17,50
SOMEONE backs away, scratching his brow. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS117
00:37:27,00 --> 00:37:32,50
SOMEONE takes out his cell. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS118
00:37:45,00 --> 00:37:52,50
On the bed behind him, SOMEONE glances at his cell. Then watches his friend. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS119
00:37:58,00 --> 00:38:02,50
SOMEONE rocks forward. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS120
00:38:00,00 --> 00:38:05,50
He rocks backward. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS121
00:38:06,00 --> 00:38:11,50
Now in a dining hall. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS122
00:38:28,00 --> 00:38:33,50
A woman sitting beside SOMEONE uses her laptop. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS123
00:38:46,00 --> 00:38:52,50
SOMEONE looks over at it then grabs her computer. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS125
00:39:09,00 --> 00:39:12,50
He puts on his jacket. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS126
00:39:10,00 --> 00:39:22,50
Outside, he hurries upstairs and jogs across a shadowy bridge. Now, SOMEONE hurries into a boathouse where Cameron and Tyler practice in a stationary rowing tank. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS128
00:39:42,00 --> 00:39:49,50
Tyler smacks his oar. Now in Porcellian Club. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS129
00:43:52,00 --> 00:43:56,50
At the other deposition. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS130
00:44:26,00 --> 00:44:35,50
His fist closed, SOMEONE shakes his head. Nighttime. We descend the facade of an academic building to the front steps. In an auditorium. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS132
00:45:36,00 --> 00:45:42,50
Forward and slowly looks up, then gazes at SOMEONE with an astonished expression. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS133
00:45:39,00 --> 00:45:43,50
Later outside. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS134
00:46:21,00 --> 00:46:25,50
SOMEONE waves. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS135
00:46:24,00 --> 00:46:29,50
They walk off, leaving the three admirers behind. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS136
00:48:26,00 --> 00:48:30,50
SOMEONE rubs his forehead. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS137
00:48:30,00 --> 00:48:34,50
Then faces SOMEONE. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS138
00:50:27,00 --> 00:50:32,50
The gray-haired attorney glances at SOMEONE's legal team. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS139
00:50:32,00 --> 00:50:36,50
SOMEONE gazes off. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS140
00:50:41,00 --> 00:50:45,50
At Kirkland House. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS141
00:50:53,00 --> 00:50:58,50
Now in a public bathroom. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS142
00:51:00,00 --> 00:51:05,50
SOMEONE eyes her body. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS143
00:51:34,00 --> 00:51:39,50
Accent the dark wood at the stall doors. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS144
00:51:37,00 --> 00:51:45,50
Later, standing outside the bathroom, a happy SOMEONE glances at his friend. A guy approaches. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS145
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:52,50
SOMEONE nods. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS146
00:51:50,00 --> 00:51:57,50
They share a grin and he goes off. SOMEONE's smile lingers. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS147
00:51:56,00 --> 00:52:00,50
They swap a grin. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS150
00:52:14,00 --> 00:52:19,50
She looks up then eyes him flatly. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS151
00:52:54,00 --> 00:52:58,50
SOMEONE looks on his friend's face. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS152
00:53:34,00 --> 00:53:39,50
SOMEONE glances aside. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS153
00:53:41,00 --> 00:53:46,50
As SOMEONE walks out, SOMEONE faces the girls. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS154
00:53:44,00 --> 00:53:48,50
Now in their dorm suite. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS155
00:54:34,00 --> 00:54:39,50
After lunch into the deposition room, where SOMEONE sits alone. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS156
00:54:44,00 --> 00:54:50,50
Seat at the table and crosses her legs. Then regards him sympathetically. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS157
00:55:13,00 --> 00:55:19,50
He glances at her. SOMEONE looks at Scans. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS158
00:55:36,00 --> 00:55:41,50
She faces her lunch. In a flashback. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS159
00:56:26,00 --> 00:56:32,50
crosses to a shelf and finds a book. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS160
00:56:56,00 --> 00:57:01,50
Now, a young woman dangles her blonde hair. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS161
00:57:06,00 --> 00:57:11,50
He notes her Stanford panty shorts. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS162
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:17,50
Furrows his brow then sets the computer on his lap. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS163
00:59:26,00 --> 00:59:30,50
the door then glances around. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS164
01:00:15,00 --> 01:00:19,50
The twins wait in the reception room. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS165
01:00:32,00 --> 01:00:36,50
The twins get up, fix their coats. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS166
01:00:42,00 --> 01:00:46,50
Phone at his desk. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS167
01:04:45,00 --> 01:04:49,50
SOMEONE wears a hoodie. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS168
01:05:05,00 --> 01:05:10,50
SOMEONE sullenly looks up at the ad executive. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS170
01:06:24,00 --> 01:06:28,50
SOMEONE faces the door. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS173
01:07:09,00 --> 01:07:14,50
Tori serves another round of drinks. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS174
01:07:14,00 --> 01:07:19,50
Looking away, SOMEONE shakes his head. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS175
01:08:57,00 --> 01:09:02,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE smile. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS177
01:10:06,00 --> 01:10:12,50
SOMEONE shoots him a scolding pout. In the present. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS178
01:10:11,00 --> 01:10:16,50
Lifts his chin. Gretchen eyes SOMEONE. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS179
01:11:00,00 --> 01:11:05,50
SOMEONE pauses on his way out. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS180
01:11:08,00 --> 01:11:13,50
As he goes, SOMEONE stares after him with an enthralled gaze. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS181
01:11:12,00 --> 01:11:19,50
Breezes out, past the restaurant staff. SOMEONE drains a glass of brandy. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS182
01:11:18,00 --> 01:11:24,50
Now in a taxicab, SOMEONE dozes on her boyfriend's shoulder. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS183
01:11:26,00 --> 01:11:31,50
SOMEONE wakes and sits up. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS184
01:11:41,00 --> 01:11:45,50
In the present. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS186
01:12:31,00 --> 01:12:35,50
SOMEONE reaches for SOMEONE. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS187
01:14:40,00 --> 01:14:45,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE, who shrugs sullenly. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS188
01:16:07,00 --> 01:16:16,50
Across the room, SOMEONE's chicken turns its head inside its cage. Now the young CFO saunters down a hallway. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS189
01:16:15,00 --> 01:16:20,50
at an intersection, he turns and follows the noise. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS191

SOMEONE scribbles on a notepad. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS193

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS199
01:19:51,00 --> 01:19:57,50
SOMEONE throws SOMEONE a beer. SOMEONE catches it and smacks the cap off on a chair. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS200
01:19:57,00 --> 01:20:02,50

01:20:21,00 --> 01:20:28,50
SOMEONE shakes his head and looks away. SOMEONE gives a wincing nod.  

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS204
01:20:26,00 --> 01:20:31,50
Now in fast motion, the sun sets. As the sky darkens. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS205
01:20:53,00 --> 01:20:58,50
SOMEONE stares off at the dance floor. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS206
01:24:27,00 --> 01:24:32,50
Look over a verdant landscape with the river flowing through it. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS207
01:24:31,00 --> 01:24:41,50
Henley Royal Regatta, Henley-on-Thames. White tents line the shore and varied boats cruise the river passing under an arched bridge. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS208
01:25:20,00 --> 01:25:23,50
As the oars rise. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS209
01:25:36,00 --> 01:25:44,50

SOMEONE storms off into a step. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS218
01:28:42,00 --> 01:28:50,50
SOMEONE swaggers through the door. SOMEONE looks helplessly to SOMEONE who bows his head. His twin link. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS219
01:28:54,00 --> 01:28:58,50

Holding the phone with his shoulder, he grabs some drinks. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS223
01:29:38,00 --> 01:29:45,50
SOMEONE opens the door and finds SOMEONE outside in the rain. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS227
01:30:01,00 --> 01:30:06,50
Six-foot bong. He rubs his eyes. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS228
01:30:34,00 --> 01:30:41,50
SOMEONE hopples out sleepily and gives SOMEONE a playful smack. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS230
01:31:33,00 --> 01:31:43,50
Sets down his bags. He shoots SOMEONE a glare then faces SOMEONE. The programmer uncomfortably lowers his half-eaten red licorice. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS232
01:31:51,00 --> 01:31:55,50
In a hallway. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS234
01:33:10,00 --> 01:33:16,50

Now in a downtown high-rise, SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit in a waiting room. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS240
01:33:56,00 --> 01:33:59,50
Into an office. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS241
01:33:59,00 --> 01:34:04,50
Two businessmen face SOMEONE. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS242
01:34:23,00 --> 01:34:30,50
Haired businessman locks eyes with SOMEONE seriously. Nighttime. The lights of New York. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS243
01:34:28,00 --> 01:34:35,50
In his apartment, SOMEONE lies asleep. A shadow passes through the light coming under it. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS244
01:34:38,00 --> 01:34:42,50
At the side, SOMEONE sits up fearfully. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS245
01:34:41,00 --> 01:34:44,50
The door swings open, revealing SOMEONE.

01:37:45,00 --> 01:37:49,50
He freely snaps his phone shut. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS253
01:37:57,00 --> 01:38:01,50
At the rented house, SOMEONE stands. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS254
01:38:00,00 --> 01:38:04,50
In the living room. A girl spray champagne.

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS259
01:39:48,00 --> 01:39:53,50
SOMEONE stares back stonily. SOMEONE swivels away. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS260
01:40:10,00 --> 01:40:14,50
In a flashback, at the Facebook office. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS261
01:40:29,00 --> 01:40:33,50
He sips a beer and the friends share a smile. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS264
01:41:09,00 --> 01:41:18,50
Office building. Grinning after him, SOMEONE kisses his fingers, flips off the building with both hands and returns to his SUV.

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS271
01:42:31,00 --> 01:42:41,50
Through the glass enclosure, we view the lawyer explaining. SOMEONE spies SOMEONE at a distance in headphones working at a station across the main floor. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS272
01:42:39,00 --> 01:42:45,50
SOMEONE perches on a nearby desk. SOMEONE bursts from the room.

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS293
01:48:22,00 --> 01:48:28,50
Sobering, SOMEONE knits his brow and leaves the room. He crosses a room on the other side. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS295
01:48:51,00 --> 01:48:55,50
Finds to slide on the others. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS296

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS298
01:49:29,00 --> 01:49:33,50
The cops face the others. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS299
01:49:39,00 --> 01:49:49,50
The first cop shines his light on SOMEONE, who turns away and runs a hand over his hair. At Facebook headquarters, SOMEONE slumps at his desk. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS300
01:49:48,00 --> 01:49:53,50
Straightening, he answers his cell. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS301
01:49:52,00 --> 01:49:56,50
At a police station. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS302
01:49:54,00 --> 01:49:59,50
SOMEONE listens gravely. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS303
01:49:57,00 --> 01:50:02,50
In the background, a staffer turns off the conference room lights. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS304
01:50:09,00 --> 01:50:13,50
SOMEONE's chest heaves. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS306
01:50:48,00 --> 01:50:54,50
On the other end, SOMEONE gives a weary shake of the head. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS307
01:50:54,00 --> 01:50:59,50
He swallows and shuts his eyes. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS308
01:50:58,00 --> 01:51:08,50
He flips his phone shut. Swiveling in his chair, he heaves a sigh. Then takes a freshly printed business card from one of the oblong boxes. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS309
01:51:06,00 --> 01:51:16,50
It reads, "I'm CEO, bitch. Mark Zuckerberg." He eyes the card then clenches it between his curling fingers. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS310
01:51:14,00 --> 01:51:19,50
He sets it aside with an unhappy sneer. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS311
01:51:25,00 --> 01:51:29,50
He faces an open laptop and punches. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS312
01:51:32,00 --> 01:51:37,50
He turns to face the young attorney. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS314
01:51:46,00 --> 01:51:51,50
Turns away shyly. Shuts his laptop then face to. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS315
01:52:02,00 --> 01:52:06,50
SOMEONE sighs and drums his laptop. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS316
01:53:00,00 --> 01:53:03,50
SOMEONE taps his laptop. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS317
01:53:25,00 --> 01:53:29,50
SOMEONE heads out. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS318
01:53:31,00 --> 01:53:35,50
She turns back. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS320
01:53:37,00 --> 01:53:42,50
SOMEONE regards him sympathetically. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS322
01:53:44,00 --> 01:53:49,50
Reception area outside. SOMEONE lingers.  

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS323
01:53:50,00 --> 01:53:56,50
He eyes his laptop screen. His jaw tensely clenched.  

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS324
01:54:03,00 --> 01:54:07,50
He stares at it. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS325
01:54:09,00 --> 01:54:13,50
He add SOMEONE as a friend. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS326

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS327
01:54:17,00 --> 01:54:22,50
SOMEONE's cursor moves to the send request button. 

THE_SOCIAL_NETWORK_DVS328
01:54:29,00 --> 01:54:33,50
Then gazes.
