THE_WATCH_DVS18
00:02:41,00 --> 00:02:46,50
The manager presses a button on the tall man's glasses. 

THE_WATCH_DVS19
00:03:06,00 --> 00:03:14,50
The tall man slaps the manager's rear. At night, the store's lights shut off and the metal security door rolls down. 

THE_WATCH_DVS20
00:03:20,00 --> 00:03:26,50
As the manager closes up, a chubby security guard arrives. 

THE_WATCH_DVS21
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:38,50
He holds up a certificate. 

THE_WATCH_DVS22
00:03:52,00 --> 00:03:57,50
His arm bears and eagle over a flag. 

THE_WATCH_DVS23
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:22,50
The manager leaves and the security guard heads into the store. 

THE_WATCH_DVS24
00:04:20,00 --> 00:04:26,50
Later, Antonio cranks up the volume on a stereo system. 

THE_WATCH_DVS25
00:04:25,00 --> 00:04:30,50
Crossing the store, he slides to a stop. 

THE_WATCH_DVS26
00:04:29,00 --> 00:04:34,50
Strutting down an aisle, he wiggles his fingers and bobs his head. 

THE_WATCH_DVS27
00:04:32,00 --> 00:04:38,50
He grabs a six-pack of Coke then spots a bottle of vodka. 

THE_WATCH_DVS28
00:04:35,00 --> 00:04:41,50
He snatches the bottle then chugs from it and spits vodka overhead. 

THE_WATCH_DVS29
00:04:43,00 --> 00:04:48,50
He dances along with a workout video. 

THE_WATCH_DVS30
00:04:46,00 --> 00:04:52,50
In the pharmacy, he picks out a medicine bottle and eats a few pills. 

THE_WATCH_DVS31
00:04:49,00 --> 00:04:55,50
Now, he rounds a corner on a tricycle, drinking and driving. 

THE_WATCH_DVS33
00:04:54,00 --> 00:05:01,50
Using a forklift, he sets a recliner chair down in front of a wall of flat screen televisions. 

THE_WATCH_DVS34
00:04:58,00 --> 00:05:04,50
Watching a movie, he lights a hand-rolled cigarette. 

THE_WATCH_DVS35
00:05:01,00 --> 00:05:08,50
In the movie, a young woman in a blue swimsuit runs her hand through her long hair. 

THE_WATCH_DVS36
00:05:11,00 --> 00:05:16,50
The televisions sputter, then cut out abruptly. 

THE_WATCH_DVS37
00:05:16,00 --> 00:05:20,50
Antonio looks around. 

THE_WATCH_DVS38
00:05:17,00 --> 00:05:23,50
He crosses to a circuit breaker panel and opens its door. 

THE_WATCH_DVS39
00:05:20,00 --> 00:05:25,50
The power goes out throughout the store. 

THE_WATCH_DVS40
00:05:25,00 --> 00:05:31,50
Antonio turns on his flashlight, then flips a few switches. 

THE_WATCH_DVS41
00:05:33,00 --> 00:05:37,50
He shines his flashlight across the store. 

THE_WATCH_DVS42
00:05:36,00 --> 00:05:40,50
An item falls from a shelf. 

THE_WATCH_DVS43
00:05:42,00 --> 00:05:46,50
Antonio leaves the circuit breaker panel. 

THE_WATCH_DVS44
00:05:44,00 --> 00:05:50,50
He walks the aisles, the beam of his flashlight leading the way. 

THE_WATCH_DVS45
00:05:47,00 --> 00:05:53,50
Advancing cautiously, he scans the surrounding shelves. 

THE_WATCH_DVS46
00:05:57,00 --> 00:06:04,50
He shines his light on a torn open box, then continues at a weary pace. 

THE_WATCH_DVS47
00:06:08,00 --> 00:06:13,50
Antonio turns to a rocking display of batteries. 

THE_WATCH_DVS48
00:06:10,00 --> 00:06:17,50
A single D battery rolls to a puddle of green slime under his foot. 

THE_WATCH_DVS49
00:06:17,00 --> 00:06:23,50
The sweaty security guard takes out a revolver and holds it up. 

THE_WATCH_DVS50
00:06:35,00 --> 00:06:41,50
Over his shoulder, he spots something coming and his eyes widen. 

THE_WATCH_DVS51
00:06:40,00 --> 00:06:45,50
Firing wild, he backs away. 

THE_WATCH_DVS52
00:06:42,00 --> 00:06:49,50
He runs out of ammo and ditches his gun, then knocks over a display of plastic bottles. 

THE_WATCH_DVS54
00:06:49,00 --> 00:06:54,50
Antonio dashes through the darkened store. 

THE_WATCH_DVS55
00:06:51,00 --> 00:06:56,50
He reaches the exit door and tries a key. 

THE_WATCH_DVS56
00:06:53,00 --> 00:06:57,50
His pursuer charges him. 

THE_WATCH_DVS57
00:06:55,00 --> 00:07:00,50
Antonio slams into the glass door. 

THE_WATCH_DVS59
00:06:58,00 --> 00:07:05,50
He falls to the floor, his blood accenting the window's emblazoned words, Join the Club. 

THE_WATCH_DVS60
00:07:02,00 --> 00:07:07,50
An empty parking lot surrounds the Costco. 

THE_WATCH_DVS62
00:07:06,00 --> 00:07:11,50
At home, the manager packs a hidden travel wallet. 

THE_WATCH_DVS63
00:07:32,00 --> 00:07:36,50
She checks a test stick. 

THE_WATCH_DVS64
00:07:48,00 --> 00:07:52,50
SOMEONE helps with her luggage. 

THE_WATCH_DVS66
00:07:55,00 --> 00:07:59,50
She leaves in a cab. 

THE_WATCH_DVS67
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:06,50
Now, a mid-sized crossover pulls into the Costco parking lot. 

THE_WATCH_DVS68
00:08:03,00 --> 00:08:11,50
Behind the wheel, SOMEONE notices various emergency vehicles parked outside of the taped off entrance. 

THE_WATCH_DVS69
00:08:09,00 --> 00:08:15,50
The emergency responders gather around a few police cars and an ambulance. 

THE_WATCH_DVS70
00:08:13,00 --> 00:08:18,50
SOMEONE steps out of his vehicle and shuts the door. 

THE_WATCH_DVS71
00:08:15,00 --> 00:08:22,50
Noticing him, a mustached officer sets down a cup of coffee. 

THE_WATCH_DVS72
00:09:38,00 --> 00:09:42,50
The officers peers at SOMEONE. 

THE_WATCH_DVS73
00:09:50,00 --> 00:09:55,50
The officer opens the blood-spattered door. 

THE_WATCH_DVS74
00:09:52,00 --> 00:09:58,50
SOMEONE stops on the threshold, his eyes wide. 

THE_WATCH_DVS75
00:09:55,00 --> 00:10:01,50
Now, wearing a suit, SOMEONE drives alone. 

THE_WATCH_DVS76
00:10:01,00 --> 00:10:07,50
Shifting his emotional gaze, SOMEONE tugs at his collar. 

THE_WATCH_DVS77
00:10:04,00 --> 00:10:09,50
He expels a deep breath. 

THE_WATCH_DVS78
00:10:13,00 --> 00:10:18,50
Back at home, SOMEONE watches a news report. 

THE_WATCH_DVS79
00:10:30,00 --> 00:10:35,50
Sergeant SOMEONE points. 

THE_WATCH_DVS80
00:10:36,00 --> 00:10:45,50
Now, at a high school football game, the tall man who bought the 3D TV at Costco sits in the crowded bleachers. 

THE_WATCH_DVS81
00:10:43,00 --> 00:10:47,50
Players and cheerleaders leave the field, 

THE_WATCH_DVS82
00:10:45,00 --> 00:10:49,50
passing a Spartan soldier mascot. 

THE_WATCH_DVS83
00:10:51,00 --> 00:10:55,50
The announcer finds a 20. 

THE_WATCH_DVS84
00:10:53,00 --> 00:11:02,50
Wearing a blue shirt with the white printed words No More Murders, SOMEONE hurries onto the field and gets handed a microphone. 

THE_WATCH_DVS85
00:11:00,00 --> 00:11:08,50
He addresses the crowd, the back of his shirt emblazoned with a cross out sign over the word Murders. 

THE_WATCH_DVS86
00:11:12,00 --> 00:11:16,50
He raises his own hand. 

THE_WATCH_DVS87
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:19,50
The mascot mocks him, rubbing his eyes. 

THE_WATCH_DVS88
00:11:32,00 --> 00:11:38,50
A young man glares at the heckling teens. 

THE_WATCH_DVS89
00:11:39,00 --> 00:11:44,50
The young man grabs a teen's throat. 

THE_WATCH_DVS90
00:11:42,00 --> 00:11:46,50
He releases him. 

THE_WATCH_DVS91
00:11:55,00 --> 00:12:00,50
The mascot gestures to cut it out. 

THE_WATCH_DVS92
00:12:01,00 --> 00:12:05,50
The young man nods. 

THE_WATCH_DVS93
00:12:16,00 --> 00:12:20,50
The tall man nods. 

THE_WATCH_DVS94
00:12:20,00 --> 00:12:25,50
Clapping, SOMEONE jogs off the field. 

THE_WATCH_DVS95
00:12:24,00 --> 00:12:31,50
Now, in SOMEONE otherwise vacant living room, the tall man stands at a snack table, 

THE_WATCH_DVS96
00:12:29,00 --> 00:12:34,50
while the young man sits on a couch playing with a butterfly knife. 

THE_WATCH_DVS97
00:12:32,00 --> 00:12:38,50
Standing by a presentation easel, SOMEONE checks his wrist watch. 

THE_WATCH_DVS98
00:12:36,00 --> 00:12:40,50
The tall man eats a snack. 

THE_WATCH_DVS99
00:12:37,00 --> 00:12:43,50
The young man flips his knife around, then makes a stabbing gesture. 

THE_WATCH_DVS100
00:12:41,00 --> 00:12:45,50
SOMEONE nods. 

THE_WATCH_DVS101
00:12:42,00 --> 00:12:46,50
The tall man holds up a chip. 

THE_WATCH_DVS102
00:13:01,00 --> 00:13:07,50
SOMEONE opens the door for a bushy-haired black man with glasses. 

THE_WATCH_DVS103
00:13:41,00 --> 00:13:45,50
He opens a nesting doll. 

THE_WATCH_DVS104
00:14:15,00 --> 00:14:20,50
He lifts the top off another one and grins. 

THE_WATCH_DVS105
00:14:28,00 --> 00:14:33,50
The three guys squeeze together on the couch. 

THE_WATCH_DVS106
00:15:16,00 --> 00:15:20,50
The young man with the knife stands. 

THE_WATCH_DVS107
00:16:48,00 --> 00:16:53,50
SOMEONE shoots a finger gun into the air. 

THE_WATCH_DVS108
00:16:52,00 --> 00:16:58,50
He plops back on the couch. SOMEONE and SOMEONE eye him. 

THE_WATCH_DVS109
00:17:11,00 --> 00:17:16,50
He unveils a poster board with a logo. 

THE_WATCH_DVS110
00:17:14,00 --> 00:17:19,50
It's a winged eye topped by a halo. 

THE_WATCH_DVS112
00:18:01,00 --> 00:18:06,50
Now, at a large home with a brick facade, SOMEONE opens a door. 

THE_WATCH_DVS114
00:18:07,00 --> 00:18:12,50
His basement boasts a pool table and wet bar. 

THE_WATCH_DVS115
00:18:15,00 --> 00:18:20,50
SOMEONE brings in the easel and handbooks. 

THE_WATCH_DVS116
00:18:23,00 --> 00:18:28,50
SOMEONE sits in a massage chair. 

THE_WATCH_DVS117
00:19:17,00 --> 00:19:21,50
A teenager enters. 

THE_WATCH_DVS118
00:19:34,00 --> 00:19:38,50
She leaves. 

THE_WATCH_DVS119
00:20:08,00 --> 00:20:15,50
Later, SOMEONE tapes a flyer to a pole. It reads, If you see something, say something. Call SOMEONE. 

THE_WATCH_DVS120
00:20:13,00 --> 00:20:18,50
Coming home, he sees someone crouched by his front window. 

THE_WATCH_DVS122
00:20:42,00 --> 00:20:46,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

THE_WATCH_DVS123
00:20:46,00 --> 00:20:52,50
SOMEONE holds the rolled up magazine to his eye and looks SOMEONE over. 

THE_WATCH_DVS124
00:21:01,00 --> 00:21:07,50
With a smirk, the slick-haired SOMEONE hands SOMEONE the magazine. 

THE_WATCH_DVS125
00:21:14,00 --> 00:21:19,50
SOMEONE watches his new neighbor cross the street. 

THE_WATCH_DVS127
00:21:18,00 --> 00:21:23,50
SOMEONE and his wife, a trim brunette, return home. 

THE_WATCH_DVS128
00:21:26,00 --> 00:21:30,50
She sees stacks of flyers. 

THE_WATCH_DVS129
00:21:45,00 --> 00:21:48,50
She hands it to him. 

THE_WATCH_DVS130
00:21:52,00 --> 00:21:56,50
She kisses him. 

THE_WATCH_DVS131
00:22:10,00 --> 00:22:14,50
Now, in SOMEONE's driveway. 

THE_WATCH_DVS132
00:22:16,00 --> 00:22:25,50
On the back of each blue sateen jacket, the words Neighborhood Watch surround a flaming winged tiger's face. 

THE_WATCH_DVS133
00:22:51,00 --> 00:22:55,50
He points to his shoulder patch. 

THE_WATCH_DVS134
00:24:20,00 --> 00:24:26,50
Nighttime. They sit in SOMEONE's car outside Costco. 

THE_WATCH_DVS135
00:24:47,00 --> 00:24:51,50
An empty can. 

THE_WATCH_DVS136
00:26:11,00 --> 00:26:15,50
SOMEONE opens the can. 

THE_WATCH_DVS138
00:26:57,00 --> 00:27:01,50
A squad car pulls next to them. 

THE_WATCH_DVS139
00:26:58,00 --> 00:27:05,50
From the passenger seat, SOMEONE motions to SOMEONE to roll down the window. 

THE_WATCH_DVS140
00:27:04,00 --> 00:27:08,50
A fat cop drives. 

THE_WATCH_DVS141
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:19,50
The fat cop puts his hands up. SOMEONE leans over. 

THE_WATCH_DVS142
00:27:32,00 --> 00:27:36,50
A flyer. 

THE_WATCH_DVS143
00:28:04,00 --> 00:28:09,50
SOMEONE writes something and hands it to SOMEONE. 

THE_WATCH_DVS144
00:28:14,00 --> 00:28:19,50
SOMEONE snatches it and hands it back to SOMEONE. 

THE_WATCH_DVS145
00:28:17,00 --> 00:28:21,50
SOMEONE holds out another ticket. 

THE_WATCH_DVS146
00:28:26,00 --> 00:28:29,50
SOMEONE takes it. 

THE_WATCH_DVS147
00:28:34,00 --> 00:28:38,50
The cop car backs up. 

THE_WATCH_DVS148
00:28:36,00 --> 00:28:40,50
SOMEONE pounds the roof. 

THE_WATCH_DVS150
00:29:04,00 --> 00:29:10,50
The mid-sized crossover kicks up dust as it tears out of the parking lot. 

THE_WATCH_DVS151
00:29:13,00 --> 00:29:19,50
Now, the guys walk the empty football field with flashlights. 

THE_WATCH_DVS152
00:29:29,00 --> 00:29:33,50
Bright lights shine in their eyes. 

THE_WATCH_DVS153
00:29:33,00 --> 00:29:38,50
Raw eggs pelt their faces. 

THE_WATCH_DVS154
00:29:38,00 --> 00:29:43,50
Four boys throw eggs from the stands. 

THE_WATCH_DVS155
00:29:49,00 --> 00:29:53,50
The kids flee. 

THE_WATCH_DVS156
00:29:50,00 --> 00:29:55,50
SOMEONE chases a boy with a backpack. 

THE_WATCH_DVS157
00:29:58,00 --> 00:30:05,50
Pumping his arms, SOMEONE sprints down the field after the boy with the backpack. 

THE_WATCH_DVS158
00:30:02,00 --> 00:30:08,50
He closes in on him, lunges, and tackles him near the end zone. 

THE_WATCH_DVS159
00:30:07,00 --> 00:30:13,50
SOMEONE pins him down as the rest of the guys run over. 

THE_WATCH_DVS160
00:30:24,00 --> 00:30:28,50
They all high five. 

THE_WATCH_DVS161
00:30:27,00 --> 00:30:33,50
As the boy breaks free, they all rush to pin him down. 

THE_WATCH_DVS162
00:30:34,00 --> 00:30:43,50
Now, in slow motion, the four men saunter toward the police station, the back of their jackets emblazoned with their flaming tiger logo. 

THE_WATCH_DVS163
00:30:41,00 --> 00:30:46,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hold the boy by his collar. 

THE_WATCH_DVS164
00:30:44,00 --> 00:30:50,50
As SOMEONE approaches, they shove the boy to his knees at the front desk. 

THE_WATCH_DVS166
00:31:10,00 --> 00:31:14,50
SOMEONE leans close on one side. 

THE_WATCH_DVS167
00:31:13,00 --> 00:31:18,50
SOMEONE leans in on the other side. 

THE_WATCH_DVS168
00:31:49,00 --> 00:31:53,50
SOMEONE hands SOMEONE the kid's skateboard. 

THE_WATCH_DVS169
00:31:53,00 --> 00:31:58,50
As they strut out, SOMEONE kicks a chair. 

THE_WATCH_DVS170
00:31:57,00 --> 00:32:03,50
SOMEONE returns the kid's backpack, then straightens the chair. 

THE_WATCH_DVS171
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:05,50
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE. 

THE_WATCH_DVS173
00:32:18,00 --> 00:32:25,50
Now, the kid skates out of the station and rolls down an empty street passed closed storefronts. 

THE_WATCH_DVS174
00:32:22,00 --> 00:32:32,50
As he comes to a deserted intersection, he notices a large, green electricity transformer fizzing and sparking on the corner. 

THE_WATCH_DVS175
00:32:29,00 --> 00:32:34,50
He slows down and stops to look at it. 

THE_WATCH_DVS176
00:32:31,00 --> 00:32:36,50
Something moves alongside of it. 

THE_WATCH_DVS177
00:32:40,00 --> 00:32:46,50
An overhead street light explodes, showering sparks. 

THE_WATCH_DVS178
00:32:43,00 --> 00:32:48,50
Behind him, a trash can falls over. 

THE_WATCH_DVS179
00:32:48,00 --> 00:32:52,50
He holds up an egg. 

THE_WATCH_DVS180
00:32:51,00 --> 00:32:55,50
Something jolts a parked car. 

THE_WATCH_DVS181
00:32:56,00 --> 00:33:01,50
He drops the egg and shoves off on his board. 

THE_WATCH_DVS182
00:32:58,00 --> 00:33:05,50
As he speeds down an empty road, a huge shadow lunges over the street behind him. 

THE_WATCH_DVS183
00:33:03,00 --> 00:33:08,50
He sees something racing along the rooftops. 

THE_WATCH_DVS184
00:33:06,00 --> 00:33:12,50
He pushes faster and cranes his neck trying for a look at the creature. 

THE_WATCH_DVS185
00:33:10,00 --> 00:33:14,50
It side tackles him. 

THE_WATCH_DVS186
00:33:12,00 --> 00:33:16,50
The skateboard hits a parked car. 

THE_WATCH_DVS187
00:33:14,00 --> 00:33:21,50
Now, a triumphant SOMEONE drives while the guys drink beer. 

THE_WATCH_DVS188
00:33:48,00 --> 00:33:53,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE sing to each other. 

THE_WATCH_DVS189
00:33:57,00 --> 00:34:02,50
They screech to a stop on an empty road. 

THE_WATCH_DVS190
00:34:33,00 --> 00:34:40,50
On the isolated country road, the four friends get out and peer closely at the car's grille. 

THE_WATCH_DVS191
00:34:40,00 --> 00:34:44,50
Green slime stains it. 

THE_WATCH_DVS192
00:34:45,00 --> 00:34:51,50
SOMEONE pulls out a long, slim tentacle with a turtle-shaped end. 

THE_WATCH_DVS193
00:34:51,00 --> 00:34:55,50
It dangles limp from his fingers. 

THE_WATCH_DVS194
00:35:12,00 --> 00:35:16,50
SOMEONE smells it. 

THE_WATCH_DVS195
00:35:37,00 --> 00:35:42,50
SOMEONE touches the slime with his fingers. 

THE_WATCH_DVS196
00:35:55,00 --> 00:36:00,50
SOMEONE scoops a sample of the slime from SOMEONE's hand. 

THE_WATCH_DVS197
00:36:03,00 --> 00:36:07,50
SOMEONE touches it. 

THE_WATCH_DVS198
00:36:12,00 --> 00:36:17,50
SOMEONE squeezes it near his ear. 

THE_WATCH_DVS199
00:36:19,00 --> 00:36:23,50
They step off the road. 

THE_WATCH_DVS200
00:36:24,00 --> 00:36:28,50
SOMEONE crouches and touches it. 

THE_WATCH_DVS201
00:36:25,00 --> 00:36:31,50
Rows of finger-sized holes dot its lower half. 

THE_WATCH_DVS202
00:36:30,00 --> 00:36:37,50
SOMEONE inserts his finger. It lights up and its sections move. 

THE_WATCH_DVS203
00:37:18,00 --> 00:37:22,50
He keeps a shotgun on them. 

THE_WATCH_DVS204
00:37:39,00 --> 00:37:44,50
SOMEONE hides it behind his back. 

THE_WATCH_DVS205
00:37:53,00 --> 00:37:59,50
On a deserted farm, the men activate the ball. 

THE_WATCH_DVS206
00:38:01,00 --> 00:38:06,50
SOMEONE lowers his uneasy gaze. 

THE_WATCH_DVS207
00:38:23,00 --> 00:38:30,50
SOMEONE sticks his finger in the ball and it shoots a beam of energy at a cow. 

THE_WATCH_DVS208
00:38:27,00 --> 00:38:33,50
Light envelops the cow until it explodes. 

THE_WATCH_DVS209
00:38:53,00 --> 00:38:59,50
Now, a radiant beam of energy hits an old tractor. 

THE_WATCH_DVS210
00:38:56,00 --> 00:39:03,50
Light ripples over its surface and it erupts in a huge fireball. 

THE_WATCH_DVS211
00:39:03,00 --> 00:39:08,50
Chunks of metal collapse in the fire. 

THE_WATCH_DVS214
00:39:08,00 --> 00:39:14,50
The explosion blows out a truck's rear window. 

THE_WATCH_DVS215
00:39:11,00 --> 00:39:19,50
Later, they face a row of round hay bales and blow one after another into smithereens. 

THE_WATCH_DVS216
00:39:16,00 --> 00:39:22,50
Dust and smoke blast several stories high. 

THE_WATCH_DVS217
00:39:22,00 --> 00:39:29,50
Now, in SOMEONE's basement, the four friends clink bottles of beer over the mysterious orb. 

THE_WATCH_DVS218
00:41:43,00 --> 00:41:49,50
Now, SOMEONE's crossover arrives back at home. 

THE_WATCH_DVS219
00:41:46,00 --> 00:41:52,50
He cuts his headlights, gets out, and lumbers wearily to the front. 

THE_WATCH_DVS220
00:41:51,00 --> 00:41:56,50
Pausing, he bends over to examine his broken grille. 

THE_WATCH_DVS221
00:41:54,00 --> 00:41:59,50
SOMEONE pulls out a small, slimy tentacle. 

THE_WATCH_DVS222
00:41:57,00 --> 00:42:04,50
Pinching one end in his fingertips, he opens a trash bin and chucks it in. 

THE_WATCH_DVS223
00:42:03,00 --> 00:42:07,50
Turning away, he pauses. 

THE_WATCH_DVS224
00:42:05,00 --> 00:42:12,50
Across the street, SOMEONE stands on his lamp lit porch, watching him with a cocktail. 

THE_WATCH_DVS225
00:42:10,00 --> 00:42:14,50
He gives a slow, creepy wave. 

THE_WATCH_DVS226
00:42:12,00 --> 00:42:17,50
SOMEONE politely returns the gesture, then heads inside. 

THE_WATCH_DVS227
00:42:15,00 --> 00:42:21,50
SOMEONE swirls the ice in his glass, smirking as he watches his neighbor. 

THE_WATCH_DVS229
00:42:19,00 --> 00:42:25,50
In his basement, SOMEONE snoops on his daughter's Facebook page. 

THE_WATCH_DVS231
00:42:24,00 --> 00:42:30,50
A video still shows her kissing a boy. 

THE_WATCH_DVS233
00:42:30,00 --> 00:42:35,50
He plays the file. 

THE_WATCH_DVS234
00:42:32,00 --> 00:42:38,50
It shows Chelsea and a tall, dark-haired boy making out in a closet. 

THE_WATCH_DVS235
00:42:35,00 --> 00:42:42,50
As they part, she faces her friend shyly while the boy makes a cocky face. 

THE_WATCH_DVS237
00:43:34,00 --> 00:43:39,50
She shuts the door in his face. 

THE_WATCH_DVS238
00:43:36,00 --> 00:43:40,50
SOMEONE lingers. 

THE_WATCH_DVS239
00:43:42,00 --> 00:43:50,50
In his house, SOMEONE stands facing a homemade evidence board covered with maps, photos, notes, and newspaper clippings. 

THE_WATCH_DVS240
00:43:48,00 --> 00:43:53,50
He studies the board with an intense stare. 

THE_WATCH_DVS241
00:43:50,00 --> 00:43:58,50
By a photo of the crazy old shotgun guy, a note labels him as Manfred Salisbury. 

THE_WATCH_DVS242
00:43:56,00 --> 00:44:01,50
SOMEONE tacks a photo of octopus sushi onto the board. 

THE_WATCH_DVS243
00:44:01,00 --> 00:44:06,50
A text from SOMEONE. Need to talk. 

THE_WATCH_DVS244
00:44:03,00 --> 00:44:09,50
Meet me at the bench on Sycamore Road. I'm desperate. 

THE_WATCH_DVS246
00:44:25,00 --> 00:44:29,50
He offers a beer. 

THE_WATCH_DVS247
00:44:59,00 --> 00:45:03,50
SOMEONE gently shakes his head. 

THE_WATCH_DVS248
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:05,50
SOMEONE turns his stare on SOMEONE. 

THE_WATCH_DVS249
00:46:44,00 --> 00:46:51,50
Avoiding SOMEONE's gaze, SOMEONE sips his beer, smacks his lips, and shrugs. 

THE_WATCH_DVS250
00:47:12,00 --> 00:47:17,50
SOMEONE creases his brow and looks away. 

THE_WATCH_DVS251
00:47:16,00 --> 00:47:20,50
The two men sip their beers. 

THE_WATCH_DVS252
00:47:17,00 --> 00:47:22,50
SOMEONE answers his cellphone. 

THE_WATCH_DVS253
00:47:39,00 --> 00:47:46,50
They leave the bench. At night, SOMEONE's pickup pulls off the country road. 

THE_WATCH_DVS254
00:47:43,00 --> 00:47:51,50
Its headlights shine on SOMEONE and SOMEONE as they peer through the windows of a charming brick house. 

THE_WATCH_DVS255
00:48:10,00 --> 00:48:17,50
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE get in the truck, SOMEONE and SOMEONE approach a wooden fence. 

THE_WATCH_DVS256
00:48:15,00 --> 00:48:20,50
Now, its gate swings open a few inches. 

THE_WATCH_DVS257
00:48:17,00 --> 00:48:22,50
SOMEONE slips through, followed by SOMEONE. 

THE_WATCH_DVS258
00:48:20,00 --> 00:48:25,50
They move through a shadowy garden wafting with mist. 

THE_WATCH_DVS259
00:48:34,00 --> 00:48:39,50
SOMEONE finds an abandoned cellphone on the ground and picks it up. 

THE_WATCH_DVS260
00:48:42,00 --> 00:48:45,50
SOMEONE turns. 

THE_WATCH_DVS261
00:48:43,00 --> 00:48:49,50
A few yards ahead, the branches of a thick cluster of bushes move. 

THE_WATCH_DVS262
00:48:49,00 --> 00:48:54,50
They glimpse a dark shape within. 

THE_WATCH_DVS263
00:48:53,00 --> 00:49:01,50
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE look on, a head rises into view and peeks above the leafy branches. 

THE_WATCH_DVS264
00:49:04,00 --> 00:49:10,50
The hairless reptilian skin gleams softly in the moonlight. 

THE_WATCH_DVS265
00:49:24,00 --> 00:49:29,50
Staring at the creature, SOMEONE slowly stands. 

THE_WATCH_DVS266
00:49:55,00 --> 00:50:00,50
The creature peers out at him with beady yellow eyes. 

THE_WATCH_DVS268
00:50:16,00 --> 00:50:21,50
He pops it in his own mouth and chews it. 

THE_WATCH_DVS269
00:50:20,00 --> 00:50:24,50
He offers another piece. 

THE_WATCH_DVS270
00:50:26,00 --> 00:50:32,50
A large claw-like hand emerges from the bushes. 

THE_WATCH_DVS271
00:50:29,00 --> 00:50:34,50
SOMEONE sets the gum in its palm. 

THE_WATCH_DVS272
00:50:32,00 --> 00:50:37,50
The fingers curl around it and the hand withdraws. 

THE_WATCH_DVS273
00:50:46,00 --> 00:50:51,50
The creature throws out Manfred's corpse. 

THE_WATCH_DVS274
00:50:50,00 --> 00:50:56,50
They gawk at the dead man's hollowed out abdomen. 

THE_WATCH_DVS275
00:50:53,00 --> 00:51:01,50
The creature stands, towering over SOMEONE. It backhands him, sending him flying against a shed. 

THE_WATCH_DVS276
00:50:58,00 --> 00:51:06,50
SOMEONE watches him fall, then snaps back to the beast who now turns his attention on him. 

THE_WATCH_DVS277
00:51:06,00 --> 00:51:10,50
It stalks toward him. 

THE_WATCH_DVS278
00:51:09,00 --> 00:51:14,50
Thorny spikes unfold from its forearm. 

THE_WATCH_DVS279
00:51:11,00 --> 00:51:17,50
Looking around, SOMEONE spots a garden gnome. 

THE_WATCH_DVS280
00:51:14,00 --> 00:51:21,50
As the creature leans close to SOMEONE, SOMEONE smashes the gnome on its head. 

THE_WATCH_DVS281
00:51:19,00 --> 00:51:24,50
It falls and snaps its neck. 

THE_WATCH_DVS282
00:51:33,00 --> 00:51:37,50
Later, in SOMEONE's basement. 

THE_WATCH_DVS283
00:51:46,00 --> 00:51:52,50
SOMEONE unveils the dark beast prone in a chair. 

THE_WATCH_DVS284
00:52:08,00 --> 00:52:11,50
SOMEONE touches it. 

THE_WATCH_DVS285
00:52:52,00 --> 00:52:56,50
The others pose around the alien. 

THE_WATCH_DVS286
00:52:55,00 --> 00:53:03,50
Now, a series of photos shows The Watch posing with the alien in increasingly wacky scenarios. 

THE_WATCH_DVS287
00:53:00,00 --> 00:53:07,50
SOMEONE kneels before the others as they cradle the alien in their arms. 

THE_WATCH_DVS288
00:53:04,00 --> 00:53:10,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hold it up and hit it with boxing gloves. 

THE_WATCH_DVS289
00:53:07,00 --> 00:53:13,50
Later, it wears sunglasses and a sombrero, a cigar in its mouth. 

THE_WATCH_DVS290
00:53:11,00 --> 00:53:16,50
As the others dance, SOMEONE poses with a guitar. 

THE_WATCH_DVS291
00:53:14,00 --> 00:53:20,50
Now, SOMEONE pretends to have doggy style sex with the alien. 

THE_WATCH_DVS292
00:53:17,00 --> 00:53:23,50
He grabs the prone being by the point at the back of its head. 

THE_WATCH_DVS293
00:53:20,00 --> 00:53:27,50
Later, SOMEONE poses so the alien looks like it's giving him a blow job. 

THE_WATCH_DVS294
00:53:24,00 --> 00:53:29,50
They dress it in a wig and lingerie. 

THE_WATCH_DVS295
00:53:27,00 --> 00:53:33,50
Now, a photo of SOMEONE slow dancing with the alien comes to life. 

THE_WATCH_DVS296
00:53:30,00 --> 00:53:37,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE pair up nearby. SOMEONE snaps a picture. 

THE_WATCH_DVS297
00:53:34,00 --> 00:53:40,50
SOMEONE gropes the alien's butt, then pretends to make out with it. 

THE_WATCH_DVS298
00:53:37,00 --> 00:53:47,50
As SOMEONE records him, SOMEONE leans the alien down in a dip. Its hand rises into view and curls around SOMEONE's shoulder. 

THE_WATCH_DVS299
00:53:44,00 --> 00:53:53,50
The alien's eyes snap open. It throws SOMEONE into a jukebox and sends SOMEONE flying. 

THE_WATCH_DVS300
00:53:52,00 --> 00:53:58,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE tumble over a sofa to get away, then split up. 

THE_WATCH_DVS301
00:53:55,00 --> 00:54:00,50
The alien knocks the sofa across the room. 

THE_WATCH_DVS302
00:53:57,00 --> 00:54:07,50
SOMEONE reaches the pool table. As SOMEONE peeks out from behind the bar, the alien leaps across the room and peers over the bar. 

THE_WATCH_DVS303
00:54:04,00 --> 00:54:11,50
SOMEONE picks up billiard balls and the alien faces him. 

THE_WATCH_DVS305
00:54:14,00 --> 00:54:19,50
SOMEONE opens a door. 

THE_WATCH_DVS306
00:54:22,00 --> 00:54:28,50
Springing from the bar, SOMEONE jumps on its back. 

THE_WATCH_DVS307
00:54:25,00 --> 00:54:32,50
The alien leaps onto a wall, then onto another, carrying SOMEONE along. 

THE_WATCH_DVS308
00:54:30,00 --> 00:54:37,50
It tackles SOMEONE. SOMEONE gets up as it leans a mouthful of sharp teeth close to the youth. 

THE_WATCH_DVS312
00:54:46,00 --> 00:54:50,50
Then helps SOMEONE wrestle it. 

THE_WATCH_DVS313
00:54:49,00 --> 00:54:56,50
SOMEONE grabs the alien's arm and SOMEONE wraps his arms around them all. 

THE_WATCH_DVS314
00:54:56,00 --> 00:55:01,50
SOMEONE puts it in a choke hold. 

THE_WATCH_DVS315
00:55:06,00 --> 00:55:13,50
It throws the men off him, sending them crashing across the room. 

THE_WATCH_DVS316
00:55:10,00 --> 00:55:16,50
Grabbing the silver orb SOMEONE, the alien escapes through a window. 

THE_WATCH_DVS317
00:55:16,00 --> 00:55:21,50
The guys writhe in pain among the SOMEONE. 

THE_WATCH_DVS318
00:55:26,00 --> 00:55:31,50
SOMEONE rolls off the broken glass on the pool table. 

THE_WATCH_DVS319
00:56:09,00 --> 00:56:16,50
Now, SOMEONE runs alone down a neighborhood street. Mrs. SOMEONE sprays him in the face. 

THE_WATCH_DVS320
00:56:18,00 --> 00:56:24,50
He slowly reaches for her startled face. She squirts him away. 

THE_WATCH_DVS321
00:56:23,00 --> 00:56:28,50
She glares at him, aiming the hose. 

THE_WATCH_DVS322
00:56:25,00 --> 00:56:31,50
Now, he runs in place at an intersection, checking his pulse. 

THE_WATCH_DVS323
00:56:29,00 --> 00:56:34,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE pull up in a squad car. 

THE_WATCH_DVS324
00:56:31,00 --> 00:56:40,50
SOMEONE slowly removes his sunglasses and gives SOMEONE a bizarre wide-eyed stare while slowly shaking his head. 

THE_WATCH_DVS325
00:56:37,00 --> 00:56:42,50
SOMEONE scowls and jogs on. 

THE_WATCH_DVS326
00:56:40,00 --> 00:56:47,50
Elsewhere, peeking out of his blinds, SOMEONE watches the mailman across the street. 

THE_WATCH_DVS327
00:56:45,00 --> 00:56:52,50
The postal worker leisurely raises his head from a stack of mail and looks directly at him. 

THE_WATCH_DVS328
00:56:50,00 --> 00:56:58,50
In the high school parking lot, SOMEONE watches his daughter approach SOMEONE, who smiles back at SOMEONE while hugging her. 

THE_WATCH_DVS330
00:56:56,00 --> 00:57:06,50
In a park, SOMEONE emerges from behind a tree and flicks open his butterfly knife as he sizes up a group of elderly people performing Tai chi. 

THE_WATCH_DVS331
00:57:04,00 --> 00:57:11,50
Now, at Costco, the four guys sit around a fake fire in a camping display. 

THE_WATCH_DVS332
00:57:19,00 --> 00:57:26,50
SOMEONE glances around as SOMEONE eyes a woman examining a grapefruit. 

THE_WATCH_DVS333
00:57:42,00 --> 00:57:46,50
A young boy sloppily eats ice cream. 

THE_WATCH_DVS334
00:57:52,00 --> 00:57:59,50
The boy stares at his ice cream cone. SOMEONE notices SOMEONE by a display of Magnum condoms. 

THE_WATCH_DVS335
00:58:00,00 --> 00:58:05,50
SOMEONE grabs several boxes and drops one. 

THE_WATCH_DVS336
00:58:20,00 --> 00:58:24,50
SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE. 

THE_WATCH_DVS337
00:58:44,00 --> 00:58:52,50
SOMEONE notices piles of batteries in SOMEONE's cart, then stares into his neighbor's brown eyes. 

THE_WATCH_DVS339
00:59:02,00 --> 00:59:08,50
SOMEONE flashes a smile and wheels his cart away. 

THE_WATCH_DVS340
00:59:05,00 --> 00:59:12,50
Extending a hand after SOMEONE, SOMEONE faces the guys and sits on a cooler. 

THE_WATCH_DVS341
00:59:46,00 --> 00:59:52,50
At night, the guys follow SOMEONE to his front door. 

THE_WATCH_DVS342
00:59:50,00 --> 00:59:55,50
Inside, he finds SOMEONE in lingerie. 

THE_WATCH_DVS343
01:00:01,00 --> 01:00:05,50
The guys enter. 

THE_WATCH_DVS348
01:01:05,00 --> 01:01:10,50
He tosses up his hands, leaving her in the candle-filled room. 

THE_WATCH_DVS349
01:01:08,00 --> 01:01:12,50
He rejoins the watch. 

THE_WATCH_DVS350
01:01:11,00 --> 01:01:16,50
The guys scurry across the street to SOMEONE's house. 

THE_WATCH_DVS351
01:01:13,00 --> 01:01:20,50
They crouch behind the bushes a dozen feet below the illuminated front porch. 

THE_WATCH_DVS352
01:01:19,00 --> 01:01:25,50
As they stare up at the front door, SOMEONE pulls out a pop top can. 

THE_WATCH_DVS353
01:01:24,00 --> 01:01:33,50
He casually sips from the can as the other three glare at him. He notices them, smiles, and raises a can in a toast. 

THE_WATCH_DVS354
01:01:37,00 --> 01:01:42,50
A nicely dressed couple approach the front door. 

THE_WATCH_DVS355
01:01:45,00 --> 01:01:51,50
SOMEONE emerges in a white dress shirt and slicked back hair. 

THE_WATCH_DVS356
01:01:49,00 --> 01:01:53,50
The couple enters the house past SOMEONE. 

THE_WATCH_DVS357
01:01:51,00 --> 01:01:55,50
SOMEONE faces the group. 

THE_WATCH_DVS358
01:02:16,00 --> 01:02:21,50
SOMEONE slides to the ground and crawls back. 

THE_WATCH_DVS359
01:03:13,00 --> 01:03:17,50
He runs toward his truck and yells. 

THE_WATCH_DVS360
01:03:24,00 --> 01:03:28,50
SOMEONE stands on the rear bumper.

Now, SOMEONE spots something and tugs her husband's sleeve. 

THE_WATCH_DVS451
01:21:41,00 --> 01:21:47,50
SOMEONE sees something, too, and he and SOMEONE duck. 

THE_WATCH_DVS452
01:21:44,00 --> 01:21:50,50

01:22:06,00 --> 01:22:11,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE enter. 

THE_WATCH_DVS456
01:22:09,00 --> 01:22:13,50
The alien's gone. 

THE_WATCH_DVS457
01:22:36,00 --> 01:22:40,50
SOMEONE hiccups. 

THE_WATCH_DVS458
01:22:39,00 --> 01:22:45,50
And alien fist clutching a human heart bursts from SOMEONE's chest. 

THE_WATCH_DVS459
01:22:44,00 --> 01:22:52,50

SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE unload on the alien. SOMEONE covers his ears. 

THE_WATCH_DVS462
01:23:00,00 --> 01:23:06,50
They stand over the gunned down creature. SOMEONE kneels over his partner. 

THE_WATCH_DVS463
01:23:09,00 --> 01:23:17,50
He grabs SOMEONE's heart off the floor, stuffs it back in his body, then tries to resuscitate the dead man. 

THE_WATCH_DVS464
01:23:23,00 --> 01:23:27,50
SOMEONE slaps him. 

THE_WATCH_DVS465
01:24:10,00 --> 01:24:18,50
As the others head off, SOMEONE stands over the gunned down alien, its body oozing green slime. 

THE_WATCH_DVS466
01:24:16,00 --> 01:24:23,50
It grabs his ankle, then flings him into a display of vitamin beverages. 

THE_WATCH_DVS467
01:24:23,00 --> 01:24:29,50
The others shoot the creature down again with a shot to the groin.

THE_WATCH_DVS475
01:25:39,00 --> 01:25:45,50
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE peer down into the darkened basement. 

THE_WATCH_DVS476
01:25:47,00 --> 01:25:52,50
SOMEONE leads the way down a ladder. 

THE_WATCH_DVS477
01:25:51,00 --> 01:25:56,50
He steps onto the wet basement floor. 

THE_WATCH_DVS478
01:25:54,00 --> 01:26:01,50
Rounding a corner, he leads his friends past walls of steaming pipes. 

THE_WATCH_DVS479
01:25:58,00 --> 01:26:04,50
They spot a tower-like transmitter across the room. 

THE_WATCH_DVS480
01:26:06,00 --> 01:26:10,50
They prepare to shoot. 

THE_WATCH_DVS481
01:26:07,00 --> 01:26:12,50
SOMEONE steps out and SOMEONE lowers his weapon. 

THE_WATCH_DVS482
01:26:27,00 --> 01:26:33,50
Thorny spikes protrude from SOMEONE's forearms. The guys take cover. 

THE_WATCH_DVS483
01:26:47,00 --> 01:26:54,50
SOMEONE steps out and fires. SOMEONE hurls him into the wall of pipes. 

THE_WATCH_DVS484
01:26:56,00 --> 01:27:04,50
SOMEONE grabs a pipe and hits SOMEONE across the face. He takes out SOMEONE's legs, then strikes again. 

THE_WATCH_DVS485
01:27:01,00 --> 01:27:09,50
SOMEONE catches the pipe mid-swing, grabs SOMEONE by the crotch, and throws him into another wall. 

THE_WATCH_DVS486
01:27:09,00 --> 01:27:14,50
SOMEONE steps on SOMEONE's throat. 

THE_WATCH_DVS487
01:27:12,00 --> 01:27:19,50
SOMEONE, the silver orb, sits atop the tower under a ring of amber lights. 

THE_WATCH_DVS488
01:27:21,00 --> 01:27:26,50
SOMEONE walks up to the tower and aims his shotgun. 

THE_WATCH_DVS489
01:27:30,00 --> 01:27:36,50
Several aliens drop from the ceiling. 

THE_WATCH_DVS490
01:27:33,00 --> 01:27:41,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE trade a look. They shoot, to no avail, even blasting a hole in one's head. 

THE_WATCH_DVS492
01:27:51,00 --> 01:27:57,50
An alien's crotch explodes. Another gets shot in the groin. 

THE_WATCH_DVS493
01:27:55,00 --> 01:28:00,50
A third goes down, then a fourth. 

THE_WATCH_DVS494
01:28:00,00 --> 01:28:07,50
The last of them falls and SOMEONE enters, peering over the barrel of a shotgun. 

THE_WATCH_DVS495
01:28:21,00 --> 01:28:30,50
With SOMEONE still stepping on his throat, SOMEONE reaches up through the young man's gym shorts and grabs hold of his genitals. 

THE_WATCH_DVS496
01:28:27,00 --> 01:28:32,50
SOMEONE grimaces in pain. 

THE_WATCH_DVS497
01:28:29,00 --> 01:28:34,50
SOMEONE's hand squeezes. 

THE_WATCH_DVS498
01:28:32,00 --> 01:28:37,50
SOMEONE yanks out a handful of green goo. 

THE_WATCH_DVS499
01:28:35,00 --> 01:28:41,50
SOMEONE collapses to his knees, then falls face down on the floor. 

THE_WATCH_DVS500
01:28:38,00 --> 01:28:43,50
SOMEONE rises to his feet. 

THE_WATCH_DVS501
01:28:40,00 --> 01:28:46,50
The alien's green, gooey genitals in his hand. 

THE_WATCH_DVS502
01:28:47,00 --> 01:28:51,50
He throws them down. 

THE_WATCH_DVS503
01:29:25,00 --> 01:29:29,50
SOMEONE lowers his gun. 

THE_WATCH_DVS504
01:29:34,00 --> 01:29:38,50
SOMEONE climbs. 

THE_WATCH_DVS505
01:29:42,00 --> 01:29:48,50
SOMEONE reaches the orb at the top of the transmitter. 

THE_WATCH_DVS506
01:29:48,00 --> 01:29:56,50
The last bar of an energy meter lights up and the orb emits a brilliant skyward beam. 

THE_WATCH_DVS507
01:29:55,00 --> 01:30:02,50
SOMEONE unplugs four cables attached to SOMEONE and the beam dies out. 

THE_WATCH_DVS508
01:30:01,00 --> 01:30:07,50
SOMEONE removes the orb from the tower, then looks around. 

THE_WATCH_DVS509
01:30:06,00 --> 01:30:13,50
The meter shows a lessening of power and the overhead amber lights go out. 

THE_WATCH_DVS513
01:30:18,00 --> 01:30:37,50
Dozens of aliens emerge from the tunnels, crawling on all fours. SOMEONE throws the orb down to SOMEONE. SOMEONE jumps to a thick cable and slides down to the floor. 

THE_WATCH_DVS514
01:30:34,00 --> 01:31:11,50
In slow motion, SOMEONE and SOMEONE pull out handguns. Walking backwards, they fire on the alien horde. SOMEONE with a pistol in each hand. As an alien lunges forward, a shot blasts open its groin. SOMEONE takes out another creature. In slow motion, SOMEONE tosses his pistols, then draws a single revolver. They all reach the ladder. As SOMEONE climbs up last, an alien grabs his ankle. 

THE_WATCH_DVS516
01:31:17,00 --> 01:31:22,50
SOMEONE shoots the alien and SOMEONE kicks it off. 

THE_WATCH_DVS517
01:31:21,00 --> 01:31:29,50
The guys climb out from the basement, then tip over a refrigerator, slamming the grate over another alien. 

THE_WATCH_DVS520
01:31:29,00 --> 01:31:35,50
As they run through the store, the alien reaches through the grate. 

THE_WATCH_DVS521
01:31:32,00 --> 01:31:39,50
A smoky blast launches the refrigerator across the room. 

THE_WATCH_DVS523
01:31:38,00 --> 01:31:46,50
The aliens scramble out of the basement, then race across the store, knocking over lawn furniture. 

THE_WATCH_DVS524
01:31:43,00 --> 01:31:51,50
The guys continue their dash to the exit, SOMEONE keeping hold of the orb. 

THE_WATCH_DVS525
01:31:49,00 --> 01:31:54,50
SOMEONE hits a red button on the wall. 

THE_WATCH_DVS526
01:31:52,00 --> 01:31:57,50
Gaining on them, the aliens round a corner. 

THE_WATCH_DVS527
