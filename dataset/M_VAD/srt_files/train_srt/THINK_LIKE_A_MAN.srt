00:02:42,00 --> 00:02:47,50
Opening it, she finds earrings inside. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS20
00:02:46,00 --> 00:02:52,50
Stifling a disappointed look, she holds them up and forces a grin. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS22
00:04:24,00 --> 00:04:29,50
His five friends all turn and stare at him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS24
00:05:02,00 --> 00:05:10,50
Cooking in her kitchen, SOMEONE gets a text: Mind if I hang with the guys? I'll pick up some pizza on the way home. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS26
00:05:26,00 --> 00:05:31,50
He leans in too close. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS28
00:05:57,00 --> 00:06:02,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE trade places. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS29
00:06:36,00 --> 00:06:41,50
The woman averts her gloomy gaze. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS30
00:07:11,00 --> 00:07:16,50
With a smile, he turns away. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS31
00:07:15,00 --> 00:07:19,50
SOMEONE counts down on his fingers. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS32
00:07:17,00 --> 00:07:23,50
He cocks his head at SOMEONE, then turns back to the pretty woman. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS34
00:09:37,00 --> 00:09:42,50
Everyone but SOMEONE raises their beer. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS37
00:10:19,00 --> 00:10:23,50
At the Ritz-Carlton. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS38
00:10:39,00 --> 00:10:45,50
She watches from her treadmill in a kitchen. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS39
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:21,50
A young man with tattoos across his pecs, shoulders, and arms sleeps in bed. The woman from the coffee shop stands over him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS40
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:33,50
Stretching, he opens his eyes. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS42
00:11:53,00 --> 00:11:59,50
She gives him another quick kiss, then heads into the bathroom. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS43
00:11:59,00 --> 00:12:04,50
He dresses hastily. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS45
00:12:27,00 --> 00:12:31,50
She reemerges. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS46
00:12:29,00 --> 00:12:35,50
She finds a note on the bed reading, Michelle, it was fun. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS50
00:12:54,00 --> 00:12:59,50
People fight over copies. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS53
00:13:16,00 --> 00:13:28,50
SOMEONE reads as she heads down a sidewalk. The successful business woman crosses paths with her and rolls her eyes. Now words type out: The Mama's Boy vs. The Single Mom 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS54
00:13:26,00 --> 00:13:33,50
In a SOMEONE and Noble, SOMEONE spots the single mother two paces ahead of him in line. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS55
00:13:30,00 --> 00:13:36,50
She hides her SOMEONE Harvey book under a kitten calendar. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS56
00:13:57,00 --> 00:14:02,50
He dawns glasses from a display and grins. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS57
00:14:40,00 --> 00:14:48,50
SOMEONE steps up to the register. SOMEONE gives the next guy a pleading look, and he lets him cut ahead. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS58
00:15:03,00 --> 00:15:09,50
Noting his disappointed look, SOMEONE turns away and collects her purchase. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS59
00:15:09,00 --> 00:15:15,50
She faces him with a surprised expression, then allows a hopeful smile. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS60
00:15:14,00 --> 00:15:20,50
At an open house: The Non-Committer vs. The Girl Who Wants The Ring 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS61
00:15:42,00 --> 00:15:47,50
A pregnant couple enters. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS62
00:15:48,00 --> 00:15:56,50
As the well-dressed husband helps his wife down a few steps, SOMEONE's friend's jaw drops. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS63
00:16:41,00 --> 00:16:46,50
The guys play horse. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS64
00:16:45,00 --> 00:16:54,50
Steadying himself on SOMEONE, SOMEONE lifts his leg and shoots the ball with one hand. It bounces off the rim. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS65
00:17:24,00 --> 00:17:29,50
SOMEONE sneers at displayed toys and a bong. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS66
00:17:31,00 --> 00:17:36,50
She knocks over a giant toy robot. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS69
00:18:04,00 --> 00:18:08,50
SOMEONE arrives. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS70
00:18:23,00 --> 00:18:29,50
Words appear: The Dreamer vs. The Woman Who Is Her Own Man 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS72
00:18:32,00 --> 00:18:37,50
He and two friends eyed the successful woman. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS73
00:18:51,00 --> 00:18:56,50
At the table, she sits with SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS75
00:21:59,00 --> 00:22:03,50
She shows the book. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS77
00:23:17,00 --> 00:23:23,50
Now SOMEONE returns home to find bare walls and empty shelves. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS78
00:23:26,00 --> 00:23:30,50
He drops his pizza box. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS79
00:24:21,00 --> 00:24:26,50
A brown lumpy sofa with duct taped cushions 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS80
00:24:47,00 --> 00:24:52,50
She shows some catalogs. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS81
00:25:23,00 --> 00:25:27,50
He kisses her cheek. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS83
00:25:28,00 --> 00:25:32,50
He turns on the TV. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS84
00:25:30,00 --> 00:25:35,50
With SOMEONE and a friend. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS85
00:25:36,00 --> 00:25:40,50
SOMEONE approaches. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS86
00:25:56,00 --> 00:26:01,50
The Player vs. The 90-Day Rule Girl 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS87
00:26:23,00 --> 00:26:27,50
SOMEONE gives a downward twitch of her lip. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS89
00:28:04,00 --> 00:28:08,50
SOMEONE stands nearby. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS91
00:28:52,00 --> 00:29:00,50
As her friend chuckles, SOMEONE's face relaxes with a conceding smile. She shakes his hand. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS92
00:29:05,00 --> 00:29:10,50
At the restaurant the chef approaches SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS93
00:29:11,00 --> 00:29:17,50
Outside, SOMEONE approaches her car and hands over her valet ticket. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS96
00:29:23,00 --> 00:29:31,50
SOMEONE watches her slide her jacket off revealing her silky smooth bare shoulders. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS97
00:29:28,00 --> 00:29:33,50
With a little smile, she gets in behind the wheel. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS98
00:29:31,00 --> 00:29:37,50
Keeping his eyes on her, SOMEONE opens the car's gull-wing door. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS99
00:29:34,00 --> 00:29:40,50
As SOMEONE drives away, he speeds off after her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS100
00:29:41,00 --> 00:29:52,50
Now that Mercedes races around a corner. Stopped at a red light, SOMEONE watches it in her rear view mirror as it slows and pulls up to her right side. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS101
00:29:53,00 --> 00:29:57,50
She lowers her passenger side window. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS102
00:29:55,00 --> 00:30:00,50
SOMEONE searches the many buttons on the console. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS103
00:30:01,00 --> 00:30:07,50
He self-consciously lifts a finger signaling her to wait. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS104
00:30:14,00 --> 00:30:19,50
His gull-wing door slowly rises. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS106
00:31:03,00 --> 00:31:07,50
She tosses it across the room. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS107
00:31:07,00 --> 00:31:16,50
Sucking in her cheeks, she gazes out at the city through floor-to-ceiling windows. Her eyes slowly shift back toward it. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS108
00:31:14,00 --> 00:31:19,50
Now SOMEONE highlights a question in SOMEONE's book, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS109
00:31:16,00 --> 00:31:21,50
What are your short-term goals? 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS111
00:31:48,00 --> 00:31:58,50
The guys play a half court three-on-three game. SOMEONE tries for a three-pointer, but it bounces off the rim and SOMEONE gets the rebound. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS112
00:33:07,00 --> 00:33:14,50
SOMEONE rubs the ball against his crotch, then tosses it to SOMEONEt. He catches it in his shirt. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS113
00:33:16,00 --> 00:33:22,50
Later, SOMEONE arrives at home to find it completely redecorated. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS114
00:33:19,00 --> 00:33:25,50
Exiting a room, a well-dressed man almost collides with him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS115
00:33:30,00 --> 00:33:34,50
He spots two guys moving a chair. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS116
00:33:58,00 --> 00:34:03,50
He grabs his chair as movers carry it off. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS118
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:17,50
The designer turns away. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS119
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:25,50
Now at SOMEONE's apartment, her friend grins as SOMEONE enters the living room wearing a tight black dress. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS120
00:35:09,00 --> 00:35:16,50
SOMEONE returns to the living room in a form-fitting sheath dress, with a longer skirt. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS121
00:35:13,00 --> 00:35:18,50
She examines her reflection in a full-length mirror. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS122
00:35:55,00 --> 00:36:01,50
SOMEONE gives Sonia a disappointed look, then turns away. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS124
00:36:01,00 --> 00:36:09,50
At the Ritz-Carlton Residences, two suited men open the front double doors for SOMEONE as she strides out, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS125
00:36:06,00 --> 00:36:11,50
dressed in the form-fitting cocktail dress. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS127
00:36:13,00 --> 00:36:20,50
He holds a Town Car's door open and she climbs in. He gratefully blows kisses skyward. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS128
00:36:17,00 --> 00:36:22,50
Sitting beside her, he gives her a rose. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS129
00:36:32,00 --> 00:36:38,50
Dressed in a chauffeur's uniform, SOMEONE turns forward and drives off. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS130
00:36:35,00 --> 00:36:42,50
Now as SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk toward his car, he hits the locks remote. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS131
00:36:41,00 --> 00:36:45,50
He heads to the driver's side. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS133
00:36:56,00 --> 00:37:02,50
He speeds off. SOMEONE stares after him, her jaw hanging. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS134
00:37:01,00 --> 00:37:06,50
The car backs up, returning to the curb in front of her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS135
00:37:04,00 --> 00:37:08,50
SOMEONE takes a steadying breath. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS136
00:37:07,00 --> 00:37:11,50
She rolls her eyes. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS137
00:37:09,00 --> 00:37:13,50
SOMEONE climbs out of the car. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS138
00:37:12,00 --> 00:37:15,50
He opens her door. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS140
00:37:19,00 --> 00:37:24,50
Now his red Taurus sedan drives off. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS142
00:37:32,00 --> 00:37:36,50
SOMEONE nods. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS143
00:37:35,00 --> 00:37:41,50
She gives SOMEONE a frustrated look. He holds up a placating hand. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS145
00:37:55,00 --> 00:37:59,50
At dinner with SOMEONE and SOMEONE 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS146
00:38:10,00 --> 00:38:14,50
With SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS147
00:38:12,00 --> 00:38:16,50
She sips wine. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS148
00:39:03,00 --> 00:39:08,50
Lifting her brow, she drinks innocently. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS149
00:39:18,00 --> 00:39:22,50
She offers a smile. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS150
00:39:35,00 --> 00:39:40,50
He lifts his wine glass. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS151
00:39:39,00 --> 00:39:45,50
Now lying back on the bed beside SOMEONE, SOMEONE exhales smoke. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS152
00:39:42,00 --> 00:39:47,50
SOMEONE releases a stream of it as well. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS153
00:40:24,00 --> 00:40:30,50
Furrowing his brow, he gives her a baffled look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS154
00:40:32,00 --> 00:40:37,50
Later in the car with SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS155
00:40:57,00 --> 00:41:01,50
She looks away. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS156
00:41:33,00 --> 00:41:37,50
He hands her the case. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS157
00:41:35,00 --> 00:41:39,50
She eyes his photo. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS158
00:41:43,00 --> 00:41:48,50
He turns away thoughtfully. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS159
00:41:47,00 --> 00:41:51,50
He hits a button on his steering wheel. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS160
00:41:51,00 --> 00:41:57,50
He closes his eyes, then gazes at SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS162
00:42:16,00 --> 00:42:22,50
As SOMEONE gazes off, his eyes forlorn, SOMEONE listens intently. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS163
00:42:39,00 --> 00:42:45,50
He shifts his gaze to the stereo's display panel. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS164
00:42:42,00 --> 00:42:46,50
SOMEONE scrutinizes him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS165
00:42:45,00 --> 00:42:49,50
He locks eyes with her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS166
00:42:48,00 --> 00:42:54,50
She glances away, then shoots him a contemplative look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS167
00:42:51,00 --> 00:42:58,50
Now at SOMEONE's apartment, SOMEONE kisses her neck as she takes off his belt. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS168
00:42:57,00 --> 00:43:02,50
He picks her up with her knees straddling his waist. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS169
00:43:05,00 --> 00:43:08,50
He sets her down. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS170
00:43:12,00 --> 00:43:19,50
She kisses him passionately. Now at SOMEONE's front door. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS171
00:43:18,00 --> 00:43:23,50
SOMEONE tentatively leans in for a kiss. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS172
00:43:23,00 --> 00:43:29,50
She meets his lips with hers. As they separate, SOMEONE grins. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS173
00:43:48,00 --> 00:43:52,50
The door opens. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS174
00:44:02,00 --> 00:44:07,50
Watching him, SOMEONE grins. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS175
00:44:10,00 --> 00:44:15,50
Duke slams the door. Outside SOMEONE's 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS176
00:44:16,00 --> 00:44:23,50
Smiling, she gazes at him hungrily, then gives him a passionate kiss. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS177
00:44:50,00 --> 00:44:55,50
With a cool look, she opens the door. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS178
00:44:53,00 --> 00:44:58,50
She flashes a smile, then closes it. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS179
00:44:55,00 --> 00:44:59,50
SOMEONE turns away. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS180
00:45:00,00 --> 00:45:08,50
Inside, SOMEONE places a red X beside another on a monthly calendar. Morning. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS181
00:45:05,00 --> 00:45:12,50
Our view drifts toward downtown Los Angeles where pale, pink light lines the horizon. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS182
00:45:10,00 --> 00:45:14,50
In her apartment, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS183
00:45:11,00 --> 00:45:17,50
SOMEONE stretches her arm across the bed as she awakes. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS184
00:45:14,00 --> 00:45:19,50
Finding the spot beside her vacant, she sits up. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS185
00:45:17,00 --> 00:45:22,50
Shirtless, SOMEONE enters the room. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS186
00:45:23,00 --> 00:45:28,50
He offers a glass of orange juice. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS187
00:45:35,00 --> 00:45:39,50
He takes her glass. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS188
00:45:43,00 --> 00:45:47,50
She forks up a bite. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS189
00:45:59,00 --> 00:46:03,50
He hands her the glass. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS190
00:46:02,00 --> 00:46:08,50
Averting her gaze, she takes a sip, then returns the drink. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS191
00:46:07,00 --> 00:46:12,50
He spots a framed photo with SOMEONE in it. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS192
00:46:21,00 --> 00:46:25,50
He crawls onto the bed. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS193
00:46:24,00 --> 00:46:29,50
He kisses her, then lowers himself on top of her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS194
00:46:27,00 --> 00:46:31,50
Now, at his loft apartment, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS195
00:46:28,00 --> 00:46:34,50
SOMEONE pads into the kitchen wearing only pajama pants. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS197
00:47:22,00 --> 00:47:26,50
SOMEONE receives a text message. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS198
00:47:25,00 --> 00:47:29,50
She reads. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS200
00:47:45,00 --> 00:47:49,50
SOMEONE arrives 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS201
00:49:03,00 --> 00:49:07,50
with SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS202
00:49:16,00 --> 00:49:20,50
SOMEONE frowns. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS203
00:49:31,00 --> 00:49:36,50
Now SOMEONE joins his friends at the bar. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS207
00:51:54,00 --> 00:51:58,50
She settles into bed. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS208
00:51:57,00 --> 00:52:02,50
He does the same, but they both lie awake. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS209
00:52:08,00 --> 00:52:14,50
SOMEONE plays a video game with Duke. Later, he shows a photo. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS210
00:52:54,00 --> 00:52:59,50
Turning, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE in his underwear. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS211
00:53:12,00 --> 00:53:17,50
Ron Artest approaches. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS214
00:53:49,00 --> 00:53:59,50
He turns and slaps each of his reluctant friends' hands. Behind him, SOMEONE Leslie and three more NBA players approach. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS215
00:53:57,00 --> 00:54:01,50
He turns. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS216
00:54:00,00 --> 00:54:06,50
SOMEONE turns back to his friends, leaning his hands on his knees. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS217
00:54:17,00 --> 00:54:26,50
SOMEONE tries to grab the ball out of Ron's hands. He hangs on it, pulling with his full weight, then falls to the floor. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS218
00:54:50,00 --> 00:54:54,50
He points to SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS219
00:54:54,00 --> 00:55:00,50
Now at a luncheon at a JW Marriott banquet room. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS222
00:55:11,00 --> 00:55:22,50
As she goes to the podium, SOMEONE brings out a tray of salads. His jaw drops. As he turns to leave, he knocks over another server. SOMEONE sees him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS223
00:55:21,00 --> 00:55:26,50
SOMEONE enters his mother's house. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS224
00:55:42,00 --> 00:55:46,50
Wide-eyed, SOMEONE looks around. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS225
00:55:48,00 --> 00:55:56,50
SOMEONE's mom glares over her wine glass, taking a long sip. SOMEONE notices a picture of SOMEONE as a boy. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS226
00:56:31,00 --> 00:56:35,50
Frowning, his mom leaves. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS227
00:56:36,00 --> 00:56:40,50
At a wall of photos, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS228
00:56:53,00 --> 00:56:59,50
SOMEONE peeks into a room decorated with trophies and posters. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS230
00:57:39,00 --> 00:57:43,50
SOMEONE shifts her wide-eyed gaze. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS231
00:57:48,00 --> 00:57:59,50
Now SOMEONE reads a chapter titled, Mama's Boys. Snippets read, Excessively attached to their mother's. He doesn't want to grow up. They just can't compete. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS232
00:58:04,00 --> 00:58:08,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit in his car. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS233
00:58:21,00 --> 00:58:25,50
Now she leads the way into her apartment. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS235
00:59:13,00 --> 00:59:20,50
As SOMEONE steps down the hall, SOMEONE flips through her collection of record albums. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS236
00:59:23,00 --> 00:59:30,50
He flips a record between his hands, sets it on the player, and gently drops the needle. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS237
00:59:33,00 --> 00:59:36,50
Stepping back, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS238
00:59:34,00 --> 00:59:40,50
SOMEONE takes breath spray from his pocket and squirts some into his mouth. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS239
00:59:37,00 --> 00:59:43,50
He gets out two condoms and looks at their different wrappings, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS240
00:59:41,00 --> 00:59:45,50
stuffing a gold one back in his pocket, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS242
00:59:45,00 --> 00:59:50,50
unbuttons his shirt and peels off his jacket. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS243
00:59:47,00 --> 00:59:52,50
SOMEONE returns with a tray. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS244
01:00:00,00 --> 01:00:10,50
Now at the loft, SOMEONE rubs his fingers in between his toes, smells them, then wipes them on the arm of his leather chair. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS246
01:01:03,00 --> 01:01:07,50
He takes two beers. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS247
01:01:16,00 --> 01:01:20,50
With SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS248
01:01:47,00 --> 01:01:51,50
They see SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS249
01:01:53,00 --> 01:01:58,50
As he strides off, Sonia laughs. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS250
01:02:02,00 --> 01:02:06,50
With SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS251
01:03:30,00 --> 01:03:34,50
The guys head out of the gym. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS252
01:04:19,00 --> 01:04:23,50
She takes SOMEONE's wine glass. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS254
01:04:37,00 --> 01:04:42,50
Inside, the guys toast with shots. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS259
01:08:38,00 --> 01:08:43,50
She playfully waves a bite in front of his mouth. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS260
01:08:50,00 --> 01:08:54,50
He finds SOMEONE Harvey's book. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS262
01:09:13,00 --> 01:09:17,50
SOMEONE makes a call. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS263
01:10:04,00 --> 01:10:08,50
SOMEONE enters. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS264
01:10:28,00 --> 01:10:33,50
SOMEONE starts toward him, and SOMEONE quickly leaves. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS265
01:12:01,00 --> 01:12:06,50
SOMEONE's eyes dart searchingly. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS266
01:12:07,00 --> 01:12:12,50
SOMEONE sits beside SOMEONE on a modern sofa. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS268
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:22,50
SOMEONE comes down the stairs. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS269
01:13:31,00 --> 01:13:35,50
SOMEONE sips some milk. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS270
01:13:58,00 --> 01:14:03,50
SOMEONE spits out his water. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS271
01:14:54,00 --> 01:14:59,50
Now SOMEONE opens the loft door for SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS272
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:03,50
With a little pout, she enters. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS273
01:15:01,00 --> 01:15:08,50
Gazing around the expansive modern space, she mouths, Whoa. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS274
01:15:15,00 --> 01:15:20,50
Wide-eyed, SOMEONE watches him pour a glass. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS275
01:15:33,00 --> 01:15:38,50
He steps close, offering a glass. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS276
01:15:36,00 --> 01:15:40,50
SOMEONE side-steps away from him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS277
01:15:38,00 --> 01:15:42,50
SOMEONE stifles a smile. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS278
01:15:43,00 --> 01:15:50,50
He moves closer. She toasts bluntly, then takes another side-step. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS279
01:15:47,00 --> 01:15:53,50
Finishing her sip of wine, SOMEONE closes her eyes ecstatically. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS281
01:16:05,00 --> 01:16:13,50
Before an impressive view of the city, an elegantly set table for two sits surrounded by candlelight. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS282
01:16:12,00 --> 01:16:18,50
Keeping his gaze on here, SOMEONE gives a soft nod. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS283
01:16:16,00 --> 01:16:21,50
The couple approaches the table and a nearby service cart. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS284
01:16:19,00 --> 01:16:24,50
As SOMEONE wraps his arms around SOMEONE from behind, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS285
01:16:21,00 --> 01:16:26,50
SOMEONE arrives bearing a covered tray. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS286
01:16:28,00 --> 01:16:32,50
He fumbles the trays lid. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS287
01:16:44,00 --> 01:16:51,50
As SOMEONE leaves the couple, he shoves one of the hors d'oeuvres into his mouth. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS289
01:17:06,00 --> 01:17:12,50
As they hold each other close, they gaze out at the city rooftops. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS290
01:17:12,00 --> 01:17:18,50
Tucking her hair behind her ear, she gives him a little shrug. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS291
01:17:18,00 --> 01:17:22,50
She closes her eyes for a moment, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS292
01:17:20,00 --> 01:17:24,50
then faces SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS295
01:17:38,00 --> 01:17:43,50
SOMEONE tosses away the rest of her hors d'oeuvre 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS296
01:17:40,00 --> 01:17:45,50
and wraps her arms around SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS297
01:17:43,00 --> 01:17:49,50
Now SOMEONE sits alone in his parked car. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS298
01:17:58,00 --> 01:18:05,50
Sitting on the closed toilet, SOMEONE consults SOMEONE Harvey's book. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS300
01:18:34,00 --> 01:18:39,50
Now SOMEONE answers her door. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS302
01:18:55,00 --> 01:19:04,50
Later, spotlights at L.A. Live shine into the sky as SOMEONE and SOMEONE stroll a bustling walkway. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS303
01:19:53,00 --> 01:19:58,50
The couple looks expectantly at SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS304
01:19:58,00 --> 01:20:02,50
SOMEONE eyes her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS305
01:20:16,00 --> 01:20:20,50
SOMEONE glances at Xavier. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS306
01:20:19,00 --> 01:20:24,50
He meets her surprised gaze. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS307
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:33,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE make out in his car. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS309
01:20:31,00 --> 01:20:38,50
Just as her granny panties come into view, she jumps back. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS310
01:20:37,00 --> 01:20:41,50
She covers herself up. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS311
01:20:46,00 --> 01:20:49,50
She kisses him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS312
01:20:49,00 --> 01:20:54,50
She hurries out of the car. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS314
01:21:29,00 --> 01:21:33,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE's phone. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS315
01:21:39,00 --> 01:21:44,50
SOMEONE pulls out of the driveway. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS318
01:21:48,00 --> 01:21:54,50
SOMEONE hits his car's remote, then leaves SOMEONE's side. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS319
01:21:52,00 --> 01:21:56,50
He opens her door. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS322
01:22:11,00 --> 01:22:16,50
SOMEONE stands at a street. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS323
01:22:14,00 --> 01:22:19,50
SOMEONE helps Duke ride a bike. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS325
01:22:20,00 --> 01:22:27,50
Later, SOMEONE and SOMEONE lie on the floor beside her bed, surrounded by rose petals. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS326
01:22:24,00 --> 01:22:30,50
He kisses her, then runs his tongue along her knee. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS327
01:22:27,00 --> 01:22:33,50
Reaching for a dish with raspberries and chocolate cake, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS328
01:22:30,00 --> 01:22:35,50
he grabs some of the dessert and feeds it to her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS329
01:22:32,00 --> 01:22:39,50
Now SOMEONE enters his living room, framed by one of SOMEONE's bare, bent legs. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS330
01:22:36,00 --> 01:22:41,50
He pauses and shakes his head. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS331
01:22:47,00 --> 01:22:51,50
He sits beside her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS332
01:22:49,00 --> 01:22:53,50
They kiss. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS333
01:23:11,00 --> 01:23:16,50
She nuzzles his nose with hers. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS334
01:23:22,00 --> 01:23:26,50
SOMEONE opens his eyes. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS335
01:23:47,00 --> 01:23:52,50
SOMEONE eyes him skeptically. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS336
01:23:55,00 --> 01:24:00,50
With a disappointed look, she gets up. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS337
01:24:04,00 --> 01:24:09,50
Now SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE outside the Ritz. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS338
01:24:08,00 --> 01:24:12,50
A battered sedan pulls up. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS339
01:24:12,00 --> 01:24:20,50
SOMEONE eyes the beat up silver car, with its missing front bumper, and exposed radiator as it peels out. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS340
01:24:17,00 --> 01:24:27,50
A woman waiting in the valet area shoots SOMEONE a dubious look. The successful business woman meets her gaze with a challenging expression. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS341
01:24:25,00 --> 01:24:35,50
A sleek black Porsche pulls into the valet area. SOMEONE's lips part in a lustful look as her eyes trail after the arriving car. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS342
01:24:34,00 --> 01:24:39,50
In slow motion, a valet heads over. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS343
01:24:37,00 --> 01:24:45,50
A gentle breeze lifts SOMEONE's hair as she watches a tall, handsome man exit the Porsche. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS345
01:24:49,00 --> 01:24:55,50
Sliding on a suit jacket he turns and looks at SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS346
01:24:55,00 --> 01:24:59,50
She stares, her jaw slack. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS348
01:25:08,00 --> 01:25:12,50
He hugs her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS349
01:26:03,00 --> 01:26:07,50
She heads off. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS350
01:26:10,00 --> 01:26:17,50
She climbs into her silver Mercedes. Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch The Jefferson's. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS351
01:26:47,00 --> 01:26:53,50
She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS352
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:04,50
Grinning, he retreats. SOMEONE leans against SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS353
01:27:33,00 --> 01:27:38,50
She turns off the TV. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS354
01:27:35,00 --> 01:27:42,50
Now at the Santa SOMEONE SOMEONE, SOMEONE stifles a smile as she strolls with SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS355
01:27:41,00 --> 01:27:46,50
She breaks into a grin. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS357
01:28:08,00 --> 01:28:14,50
As she embraces her, a horrified look crosses his face. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS358
01:28:11,00 --> 01:28:17,50
Pulling away, SOMEONE gazes into his eyes. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS359
01:28:21,00 --> 01:28:26,50
Later, in his bedroom, SOMEONE strips off SOMEONE's vest. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS360
01:28:24,00 --> 01:28:30,50
Kissing her, he backs her up against a dresser and knocks over a lamp. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS362
01:28:29,00 --> 01:28:36,50
He gazes up at her as she slides her silky tank top over her head, 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS363
01:28:33,00 --> 01:28:37,50
then lowers herself over him. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS364
01:28:35,00 --> 01:28:43,50
On the wall behind her, a framed painting shows a boxer with both gloves raised triumphantly in the air. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS366
01:28:41,00 --> 01:28:46,50
SOMEONE lies asleep in SOMEONE's bed. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS368
01:28:47,00 --> 01:28:53,50
Waking up, she finds a note in the vacant spot beside her. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS369
01:28:51,00 --> 01:28:59,50
With a dejected look, she opens it and reads, SOMEONE, ran out for breakfast. Be right back. SOMEONE. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS370
01:29:00,00 --> 01:29:05,50
She shifts her thoughtful eyes, then gives a pleased look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS371
01:29:02,00 --> 01:29:08,50
Sitting up, she scoots to the edge of the bed. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS372
01:29:06,00 --> 01:29:11,50
She opens a drawer in a bedside table. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS373
01:29:08,00 --> 01:29:16,50
Finding a photo of SOMEONE as a boy, dressed in a football uniform and posing on one knee, she picks it up. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS374
01:29:18,00 --> 01:29:23,50
Returning it, she slides the drawer open farther. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS375
01:29:23,00 --> 01:29:28,50
She finds a copy of SOMEONE Harvey's book. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS376
01:29:28,00 --> 01:29:35,50
She opens it to a bookmarked chapter with its heading circled: The 90-Day Rule. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS377
01:29:32,00 --> 01:29:37,50
Later, she sits on the steps with the book. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS378
01:29:35,00 --> 01:29:40,50
SOMEONE enters, clutching a bag in his mouth. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS379
01:29:37,00 --> 01:29:43,50
He holds a box in one hand and a drink carrier in the other. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS380
01:29:44,00 --> 01:29:48,50
He sets the food down. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS381
01:29:54,00 --> 01:29:59,50
His smile fades as he sees the book in her hand. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS383
01:30:36,00 --> 01:30:41,50
SOMEONE opens his mouth as if to speak. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS384
01:30:48,00 --> 01:30:52,50
She pushes him away. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS385
01:31:08,00 --> 01:31:13,50
Now SOMEONE's caller ID flashes, Work. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS386

SOMEONE glances away.

A sticky note on it reads, Found this with your stuff. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS401
01:34:37,00 --> 01:34:42,50
Boys shack, men build homes. I'm out, K. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS402
01:34:40,00 --> 01:34:50,50
Between its pages, he finds a printout of his unsubmitted résumé where the words, Blah, blah, blah, filled the blurb for the professional development section. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS403
01:34:49,00 --> 01:34:55,50
Dropping the book on the coffee table,

SOMEONE spots him from the doorway.

As SOMEONE works at a valet station, a silver Mercedes, like SOMEONE's, pulls up. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS411
01:36:06,00 --> 01:36:14,50

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS414
01:36:15,00 --> 01:36:23,50
Later, SOMEONE gazes at a framed photo of himself and SOMEONE dressed as blue Na'vi from Avatar.

She flashes a tight smile, which fades to a glum look. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS420
01:36:43,00 --> 01:36:51,50
Following the bartender's gaze, SOMEONE sees a woman at the end of the bar. She offers him a smile. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS421
01:36:57,00 --> 01:37:06,50
Now at her apartment, SOMEONE rips down her monthly calendar, which shows almost three weeks filled with red Xs.

Entering the bathroom, SOMEONE checks the stalls as he makes a phone call.

01:39:43,00 --> 01:39:49,50
In a kitchen, a full-figured woman answers the phone.

a tear trickles down her cheek. 

THINK_LIKE_A_MAN_DVS461
