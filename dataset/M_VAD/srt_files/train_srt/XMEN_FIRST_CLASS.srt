XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS38
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:51,50
Finding light spilling from an open door, he ventures through and finds a woman at a refrigerator. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS39
00:02:58,00 --> 00:03:03,50
The boy lingers, staring at her. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS40
00:03:03,00 --> 00:03:09,50
She leans forward with an inviting smile. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS41
00:03:10,00 --> 00:03:17,50
Her smile fades. The boy glances at a photo of himself with his mother. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS42
00:03:20,00 --> 00:03:25,50
He advances, his lips unmoving. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS43
00:03:27,00 --> 00:03:33,50
Holding her head, the impostor lowers her hands. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS44
00:03:30,00 --> 00:03:38,50
Blue scales ripple over the figure in a wave as the stranger reveals her true form. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS45
00:03:35,00 --> 00:03:45,50
A naked little girl with blue scaly skin, bright-yellow eyes, and slick dark-red hair that flips outward just above her shoulder. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS46
00:03:43,00 --> 00:03:47,50
SOMEONE beams at her. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS47
00:04:01,00 --> 00:04:06,50
He warmly extends his hand. The girl shakes it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS48
00:04:13,00 --> 00:04:17,50
SOMEONE beams gratefully. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS49
00:04:19,00 --> 00:04:24,50
Her smile grows into a radiant grin 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS50
00:04:21,00 --> 00:04:26,50
Now at the concentration camp. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS51
00:04:24,00 --> 00:04:30,50
In an office, an aging hand sets a needle on a spinning record. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS52
00:04:31,00 --> 00:04:36,50
The owner crosses to a desk. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS54
00:04:35,00 --> 00:04:41,50
Understand this, SOMEONE. These Nazis, I'm not like them. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS55
00:04:39,00 --> 00:04:44,50
He sets a chocolate bar before him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS56
00:04:41,00 --> 00:04:48,50
Wearing spectacles, he smiles at the thin boy through a graying mustache. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS58
00:04:47,00 --> 00:04:52,50
He unwraps the candy. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS61
00:04:53,00 --> 00:04:59,50
The aging man breaks off a hunk of chocolate and takes a bite. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS62
00:04:57,00 --> 00:05:02,50
He slides the candy bar forward on his desk. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS64
00:05:03,00 --> 00:05:09,50
SOMEONE eyes the chocolate, licks his lips, then meets the man's gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS66
00:05:09,00 --> 00:05:16,50
The man sternly slides the chocolate back toward himself, then licks his finger. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS73
00:05:31,00 --> 00:05:38,50
Holding the boy in a grave stare, he indicates a coin sitting on the desk before him.. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS75
00:05:39,00 --> 00:05:46,50
SOMEONE sighs, shifts his gaze to the coin, and grits his teeth. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS76
00:05:43,00 --> 00:05:49,50
His lean features SOMEONE and contort with effort. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS77
00:05:47,00 --> 00:05:53,50
On the desk, the coin sits, unmoving, beside a little brass bell. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS78
00:05:51,00 --> 00:05:55,50
SOMEONE extends his hands toward it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS79
00:05:54,00 --> 00:05:59,50
His face flush, the boy lowers his arms apologetically. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS82
00:06:04,00 --> 00:06:10,50
His gaze troubled, the doctor shifts thoughtfully in his chair. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS83
00:06:07,00 --> 00:06:12,50
SOMEONE sighs remorsefully. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS85
00:06:15,00 --> 00:06:19,50
The boy winces sheepishly. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS87
00:06:20,00 --> 00:06:24,50
The man rings the bell. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS88
00:06:21,00 --> 00:06:29,50
A glass wall beside them reveals a medical lab equipped with gruesome-looking tool 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS89
00:06:26,00 --> 00:06:32,50
Two guards bring SOMEONE's mother into the office. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS90
00:06:30,00 --> 00:06:35,50
The boy rushes to her. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS94
00:06:36,00 --> 00:06:42,50
At the doctor's signal, the guards separate the two. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS100
00:06:51,00 --> 00:06:57,50
He slides the coin toward SOMEONE, then turns his aim on the boy's mother. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS102
00:06:58,00 --> 00:07:03,50
SOMEONE extends his hands. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS104
00:07:01,00 --> 00:07:05,50
He faces his mother. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS106
00:07:04,00 --> 00:07:10,50
He looks down at the coin, his hands shaking with effort. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS108
00:07:10,00 --> 00:07:15,50
SOMEONE's mother gives a gentle nod. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS110
00:07:16,00 --> 00:07:23,50
The boy bares his gritted teeth and stares between his hands at the unmoving coin. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS111
00:07:21,00 --> 00:07:25,50
His face flushes dark pink. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS112
00:07:23,00 --> 00:07:28,50
The doctor eyes the coin coldly. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS114
00:07:33,00 --> 00:07:37,50
SOMEONE's mother collapses behind him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS115
00:07:35,00 --> 00:07:42,50
He lowers his arms, staring as the doctor lowers the gun remorsefully. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS116
00:07:40,00 --> 00:07:46,50
With hesitation, the boy turns and looks down at his mother. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS117
00:07:43,00 --> 00:07:49,50
He faces the doctor with a wrathful glare. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS118
00:07:46,00 --> 00:07:53,50
On the desk, the brass bell crumples as if squeezed by an unseen force. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS119
00:07:51,00 --> 00:07:55,50
The doctor notices. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS122
00:07:57,00 --> 00:08:06,50
A tall file cabinet in a corner ejects its drawers, then buckles. The doctor smiles approvingly at the boy. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS124
00:08:07,00 --> 00:08:13,50
Tables in the medical lab quiver as SOMEONE faces the guard 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS125
00:08:10,00 --> 00:08:17,50
They clutch their heads as the boy crushes their helmets into their skulls. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS126
00:08:14,00 --> 00:08:21,50
The doctor stands staring at the rattling-steel lab tables. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS127
00:08:18,00 --> 00:08:24,50
SOMEONE screams at the guards, who sink to their knees before him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS128
00:08:22,00 --> 00:08:28,50
Facing the lab, he stretches his arms wide. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS129
00:08:25,00 --> 00:08:32,50
The tables soar through the air and the medical instruments rip free from their posts. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS130
00:08:30,00 --> 00:08:35,50
Every metal object in the room whips around chaotically. The doctor laughs. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS131
00:08:33,00 --> 00:08:37,50
SOMEONE lowers his arms. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS132
00:08:35,00 --> 00:08:41,50
His chest heaving. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS134
00:08:41,00 --> 00:08:47,50
Bowing his head, he bursts into tear. His thin stooping shoulders quiver with sob 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS135
00:08:44,00 --> 00:08:52,50
The doctor comes over, puts an arm around him, and surveys the devastated medical lab. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS138
00:08:55,00 --> 00:09:01,50
Keeping an arm around the boy, he opens the lab door. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS140
00:09:01,00 --> 00:09:06,50
He walks the weeping SOMEONE into the room. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS142
00:09:09,00 --> 00:09:14,50
The doctor puts the coin in SOMEONE's hand, pats his shoulder, and leaves him alone. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS144
00:09:14,00 --> 00:09:18,50
SOMEONE looks down at the token. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS145
00:09:16,00 --> 00:09:25,50
As the rest of the scene fades to black, the Nazi coin hovers in the darkness, then rotates. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS146
00:09:22,00 --> 00:09:27,50
A large X stamps the other side. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS147
00:09:25,00 --> 00:09:30,50
Words beneath read, "First Class." 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS148
00:09:28,00 --> 00:09:34,50
Now the coin floats around the spread fingers of a grown man's hand. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS149
00:09:32,00 --> 00:09:39,50
A concentration camp identification number mars his inner forearm. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS150
00:09:36,00 --> 00:09:45,50
Now an athletically built man with broodingly handsome features, SOMEONE sits up on a bed, his back against the wall. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS151
00:09:43,00 --> 00:09:50,50
Clad in a bathrobe, he stares ahead with a haunted expression. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS152
00:09:47,00 --> 00:09:54,50
On the far wall, snapshots hang posted to various spots on a map. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS153
00:09:52,00 --> 00:09:58,50
We take in the space and find it to be a modest hotel room. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS154
00:09:55,00 --> 00:09:59,50
Words appear. Geneva, Switzerland. 1962. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS156
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:07,50
His gaze hardens as it focuses on a sketch of his childhood tormentor. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS157
00:10:04,00 --> 00:10:11,50
With a flick of his hand, he sends the coin flying as fast as an arrow. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS158
00:10:08,00 --> 00:10:14,50
It embeds in the forehead of the doctor's portrait. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS159
00:10:12,00 --> 00:10:18,50
Now words appear over a campus. "Oxford University, England." 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS160
00:10:16,00 --> 00:10:24,50
In a pub, a boyishly attractively young man approaches a pretty woman with one blue eye and one green eye. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS161
00:10:33,00 --> 00:10:37,50
A beautiful blonde looks on. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS162
00:11:15,00 --> 00:11:21,50
The blonde approaches the two as they raise their glasses. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS163
00:11:39,00 --> 00:11:44,50
One of SOMEONE's eyes changes color. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS164
00:11:52,00 --> 00:11:55,50
They leave. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS165
00:12:23,00 --> 00:12:28,50
Now toothpaste squeezes out on a toothbrush. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS166
00:12:26,00 --> 00:12:31,50
In her natural blue form, SOMEONE faces a mirror. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS167
00:12:31,00 --> 00:12:36,50
Clad in a fuzzy robe, she brushes her teeth. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS168
00:12:35,00 --> 00:12:42,50
She faces a doorway, which shows her adopted brother hunched over paperwork on a desk. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS169
00:12:40,00 --> 00:12:44,50
SOMEONE leans over, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS170
00:12:42,00 --> 00:12:47,50
spits, and faces her reflection morosely. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS171
00:12:48,00 --> 00:12:52,50
She leaves the bathroom. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS172
00:12:49,00 --> 00:12:56,50
Lingering near the doorway, she faces SOMEONE with a vulnerable gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS173
00:13:02,00 --> 00:13:08,50
Looking up from his work, he takes in her natural scaly form. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS174
00:13:07,00 --> 00:13:12,50
SOMEONE lowers her wounded gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS175
00:13:29,00 --> 00:13:35,50
As he moves to a couch, she flops down next to him and nestles. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS176
00:14:01,00 --> 00:14:08,50
In a European city, SOMEONE arrives at an austere building. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS177
00:14:05,00 --> 00:14:11,50
Now we face a gold bar marked with a swastika. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS178
00:14:09,00 --> 00:14:15,50
Possession of that gold is illegal. I should inform the police. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS183
00:14:21,00 --> 00:14:26,50
In an office, The banker eyes SOMEONE warily. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS186
00:14:32,00 --> 00:14:38,50
He notices a framed baby photo and smile 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS192
00:14:46,00 --> 00:14:51,50
The banker reaches for an alarm button. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS193
00:14:49,00 --> 00:14:55,50
SOMEONE uses the banker's watch to stop his arm, then makes him smack himself. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS195
00:14:56,00 --> 00:15:01,50
He stands and steps around the desk. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS197
00:15:01,00 --> 00:15:06,50
He looms over the banker. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS200
00:15:08,00 --> 00:15:13,50
SOMEONE seizes him and leans over menacingly. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS206
00:15:29,00 --> 00:15:38,50
SOMEONE maintains his telekinetic hold on the banker's fillings, his face luminous with sadistic glee. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS207
00:15:36,00 --> 00:15:42,50
His deep-set blue eyes gleam as the man's jaw wrenches helplessly. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS208
00:15:40,00 --> 00:15:47,50
From inside his victim's mouth, a metal crown springs from a molar. SOMEONE catches it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS210
00:15:46,00 --> 00:15:52,50
He calmly strolls back around the desk, then faces the banker. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS212
00:15:53,00 --> 00:15:59,50
He takes the gold bar, picks up a briefcase, and heads for the door. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS217
00:16:06,00 --> 00:16:10,50
He leaves. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS218
00:16:07,00 --> 00:16:20,50
Now as we travel along a strip of casinos, words appear: Las Vegas, Nevada. Outside an establishment marked "Atomic," a bespectacled man sits in a parked car with a lovely auburn-haired woman. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS219
00:16:24,00 --> 00:16:29,50
They watch the club entrance. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS220
00:16:39,00 --> 00:16:43,50
Women in bras and panties 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS221
00:16:45,00 --> 00:16:50,50
his partner strips to her underwear. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS222
00:16:51,00 --> 00:16:58,50
In a private room, an exquisite scantily clad blonde joins SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS223
00:17:06,00 --> 00:17:10,50
The women arrive. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS224
00:17:08,00 --> 00:17:15,50
SOMEONE leads them through a doorway, followed by the parade of lingerie-clad women. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS225
00:17:12,00 --> 00:17:20,50
She leads the colonel down a stairway onto an opulently decorated casino floor. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS226
00:17:17,00 --> 00:17:23,50
Its patrons take notice as the women arrive behind them. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS227
00:17:21,00 --> 00:17:26,50
In the private room, the female agent picks up the rear. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS228
00:17:24,00 --> 00:17:35,50
Wearing a black SOMEONE ensemble of bra, panties, and garter belt, she breezes past a bouncer, who follows her dutifully into the casino and shuts the door. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS229
00:17:32,00 --> 00:17:40,50
Gazing over the gaming floor, the agent notices women joining men in private alcove 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS230
00:17:37,00 --> 00:17:42,50
then drawing thick heavy curtain 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS231
00:17:39,00 --> 00:17:46,50
At the end, SOMEONE shuts herself into an alcove with SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS232
00:17:43,00 --> 00:17:48,50
The agent crosses the floor. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS233
00:17:54,00 --> 00:17:59,50
She squeezes past more gawking men. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS234
00:17:58,00 --> 00:18:02,50
They gaze hungrily after her. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS235
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:05,50
Reaching SOMEONE's alcove, she parts the curtain. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS236
00:18:02,00 --> 00:18:06,50
It's empty. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS237
00:18:03,00 --> 00:18:09,50
Wide eyed, the agent looks over her shoulder and scans the room. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS238
00:18:07,00 --> 00:18:12,50
She slips inside the alcove and draws the curtain. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS239
00:18:10,00 --> 00:18:15,50
Now a record spins on a turntable. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS240
00:18:13,00 --> 00:18:21,50
In a tux, SOMEONE's childhood tormentor leaves the record player, now 20 years younger. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS241
00:18:27,00 --> 00:18:32,50
He takes a seat on a sprawling couch. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS242
00:18:41,00 --> 00:18:47,50
SOMEONE sits near SOMEONE on a matching sofa positioned opposite. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS243
00:18:45,00 --> 00:18:53,50
In the club alcove, the agent pats around the table edge, then presses an ashtray at its center. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS244
00:18:50,00 --> 00:18:56,50
Her eyes widen as the alcove spin 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS245
00:18:53,00 --> 00:19:00,50
It opens up on a warmly lit study furnished in polished wood and brown leather. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS246
00:18:58,00 --> 00:19:04,50
The agent ducks out of sight, then cautiously ventures in. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS247
00:19:02,00 --> 00:19:06,50
Noticing files on a desk, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS248
00:19:03,00 --> 00:19:08,50
she hurries over and searches them. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS249
00:19:06,00 --> 00:19:11,50
Among the files, she finds a document typed in Russian. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS250
00:19:09,00 --> 00:19:15,50
Her brow lifts and she gives an astonished smile. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS251
00:19:12,00 --> 00:19:17,50
with SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS252
00:19:32,00 --> 00:19:35,50
He stands. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS253
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:41,50
SOMEONE looks to a lanky man, with a mane of black hair, seated at a bar, and twirls his finger. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS254
00:19:38,00 --> 00:19:44,50
The man opens his hand, producing a miniature cyclone. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS255
00:19:41,00 --> 00:19:46,50
It quickly gathers size and strength. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS256
00:19:47,00 --> 00:19:51,50
He releases it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS257
00:19:48,00 --> 00:19:54,50
It grows to the size of a man as it reaches SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS258
00:19:51,00 --> 00:19:58,50
The cyclone-maker flicks his hand and the whirlwind knocks the colonel into a wall. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS259
00:19:56,00 --> 00:20:01,50
In the study, the agent ducks and faces a bookcase, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS260
00:19:58,00 --> 00:20:02,50
then creeps toward it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS261
00:20:01,00 --> 00:20:07,50
In the next room, SOMEONE addresses SOMEONE telepathically. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS262
00:20:12,00 --> 00:20:20,50
In the study, the agent peeks through a gap between the bookcases and finds SOMEONE standing over SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS263
00:20:18,00 --> 00:20:22,50
SOMEONE nods to his associate. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS264
00:20:20,00 --> 00:20:26,50
Her flesh-and-blood form becomes crystalline like a diamond. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS265
00:20:23,00 --> 00:20:30,50
The agent fearfully ducks out of sight, then steels herself and peers back in. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS266
00:20:39,00 --> 00:20:48,50
SOMEONE whistles. A red-skinned man, with sharp devilish features and a tail, materializes beside SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS268
00:20:47,00 --> 00:20:53,50
SOMEONE extends a crimson hand to SOMEONE, who stares. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS269
00:20:51,00 --> 00:20:57,50
The colonel takes his hand and they vanish. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS270
00:21:03,00 --> 00:21:08,50
A gray-haired man uses a phone. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS271
00:21:13,00 --> 00:21:17,50
SOMEONE sits a few feet away. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS272
00:21:40,00 --> 00:21:44,50
MacTaggert faces her partner. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS273
00:21:44,00 --> 00:21:48,50
At Oxford University, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS274
00:21:49,00 --> 00:21:54,50
SOMEONE steps outside with SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS275
00:22:03,00 --> 00:22:08,50
A few yards behind them, MacTaggert follow 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS276
00:22:06,00 --> 00:22:13,50
Now words appear over a grassy hill with a view of a distant snow-capped mountain. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS277
00:22:10,00 --> 00:22:15,50
Villa Gesell, Argentina. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS278
00:22:12,00 --> 00:22:20,50
A tall athletically built man in white and khaki walks over the knoll, his jacket slung over his shoulder. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS279
00:22:18,00 --> 00:22:23,50
He hikes toward an inn on the other side. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS280
00:22:21,00 --> 00:22:26,50
Later he enters a tavern. It's SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS281
00:22:23,00 --> 00:22:30,50
The broodingly handsome man hangs up his jacket and hat, and approaches the bar. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS282
00:22:32,00 --> 00:22:36,50
Afternoon, gentlemen. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS283
00:22:34,00 --> 00:22:37,50
Hot out there. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS284
00:22:35,00 --> 00:22:39,50
Beer, please. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS285
00:22:37,00 --> 00:22:41,50
He takes a seat. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS286
00:22:38,00 --> 00:22:43,50
Two older men sit at a nearby table. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS287
00:22:40,00 --> 00:22:46,50
On a wall, a photo shows the two men with a third between them. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS288
00:22:44,00 --> 00:22:49,50
It reads, "Caspartina, Miami." 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS289
00:22:46,00 --> 00:22:50,50
SOMEONE notices it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS290
00:22:48,00 --> 00:22:55,50
His expression hardens as he recognizes the third man as his Nazi tormentor. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS291
00:22:52,00 --> 00:22:58,50
He blinks and looks away with a tightened jaw. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS292
00:22:55,00 --> 00:23:01,50
The bartender brings him a tall glass of beer. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS297
00:23:08,00 --> 00:23:14,50
SOMEONE takes a long drink, keeping his back to the laughing patron. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS298
00:23:11,00 --> 00:23:16,50
He lowers his glass and chuckles bitterly. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS299
00:23:14,00 --> 00:23:18,50
The best. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS300
00:23:16,00 --> 00:23:21,50
With a cold scowl, he turns to face the stranger. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS303
00:23:29,00 --> 00:23:34,50
His friend glances up from his drink. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS305
00:23:34,00 --> 00:23:41,50
Since I was a boy, my father made the finest suits in Dusseldorf. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS306
00:23:38,00 --> 00:23:44,50
SOMEONE extends a cordial arm. My parents were from Dusseldorf. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS307
00:23:42,00 --> 00:23:46,50
He joins them. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS311
00:23:51,00 --> 00:23:56,50
He clinks his glass with the first man. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS313
00:23:55,00 --> 00:23:59,50
He toasts the second man. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS314
00:23:57,00 --> 00:24:05,50
As he raises his glass to his lips, the other two follow suit, swapping uneasy looks. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS315
00:24:02,00 --> 00:24:11,50
SOMEONE takes a long drink and the others wait until he lowers his glass before they warily lower their 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS316
00:24:10,00 --> 00:24:17,50
SOMEONE turns his arm over revealing his concentration camp number. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS317
00:24:14,00 --> 00:24:20,50
The pig farmer reaches for a knife as his friend's eyes widen. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS318
00:24:18,00 --> 00:24:26,50
He plunges the knife at SOMEONE, who disarms him, pins his wrist on the table, and reads an inscription on the blade "Blood and Honor". 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS323
00:24:31,00 --> 00:24:37,50
He stabs the farmer's hand. The bartender aims a gun. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS326
00:24:38,00 --> 00:24:43,50
SOMEONE glowers at his would-be shooter. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS327
00:24:40,00 --> 00:24:49,50
The bartender's arm trembles and he stares at the gun. His aim sweeps toward the tailor and the trigger moves. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS328
00:24:48,00 --> 00:24:57,50
SOMEONE sends the knife flying into the bartender’s chest, summons it back into his grip, and pins the farmer's hand to the table. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS329
00:24:54,00 --> 00:24:59,50
He finishes his beer. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS330
00:24:58,00 --> 00:25:03,50
SOMEONE faces him gravely. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS331
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:09,50
The Holocaust survivor turns. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS332
00:25:06,00 --> 00:25:13,50
He gets to his feet, leaving the former Nazi pinned helplessly. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS333
00:25:10,00 --> 00:25:17,50
SOMEONE swaggers to the photo hanging on the wall and stares at it piercingly. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS334
00:25:18,00 --> 00:25:24,50
The gun floats to his hand and he aims at the farmer. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS335
00:25:23,00 --> 00:25:28,50
On the wall, the farmer's shadow collapses. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS336
00:25:25,00 --> 00:25:33,50
In a pub, young men and women cheer on SOMEONE as he drains a yard glass of beer. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS337
00:25:30,00 --> 00:25:36,50
SOMEONE laughs and lifts her arms as he finishes. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS338
00:25:34,00 --> 00:25:39,50
A SOMEONE slaps his back. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS339
00:25:36,00 --> 00:25:42,50
SOMEONE stumbles down off a chair and SOMEONE hugs him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS340
00:25:47,00 --> 00:25:52,50
As he swaggers toward the bar, MacTaggert intercepts him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS341
00:26:39,00 --> 00:26:46,50
SOMEONE lays fingertips against his temple and gazes thoughtfully at her. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS342
00:26:44,00 --> 00:26:53,50
Beyond the agent, the bar dissolves into images of SOMEONE, SOMEONE Frost in her diamond form, and SOMEONE appearing. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS343
00:26:57,00 --> 00:27:01,50
SOMEONE lowers his hand. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS344
00:27:03,00 --> 00:27:07,50
SOMEONE lowers her gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS345
00:27:11,00 --> 00:27:17,50
Now words appear beneath a dock. Miami, Florida. On a yacht. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS346
00:27:26,00 --> 00:27:32,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE, who reclines on a lounge chair. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS347
00:27:36,00 --> 00:27:42,50
As the cyclone-making mutant approaches, SOMEONE produces a grenade. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS348
00:27:56,00 --> 00:28:02,50
SOMEONE hooks his finger around the grenade's pin. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS349
00:27:59,00 --> 00:28:07,50
Peering at him through dark sunglasses, SOMEONE coolly strolls up to the military commander. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS350
00:28:07,00 --> 00:28:13,50
He reaches out and pries the explosive from SOMEONE's grasp. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS351
00:28:11,00 --> 00:28:15,50
SOMEONE gives a smirk. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS352
00:28:14,00 --> 00:28:20,50
SOMEONE shifts anxiously on his feet as SOMEONE pulls the pin. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS353
00:28:17,00 --> 00:28:22,50
SOMEONE looks on calmly. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS354
00:28:19,00 --> 00:28:30,50
A fiery blast blots him from view, then shrinks. SOMEONE's clothes flutter as he contains the explosion between his hands, then absorbs it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS355
00:28:41,00 --> 00:28:50,50
He taps SOMEONE's shoulder. From the point of contact, radiant energy expands and consumes his form. At CIA headquarters. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS357
00:29:12,00 --> 00:29:16,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS358
00:29:22,00 --> 00:29:26,50
He eyes SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS359
00:29:49,00 --> 00:29:54,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE swap looks. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS360
00:29:56,00 --> 00:30:04,50
Seated by SOMEONE, SOMEONE bolts to her feet and assumes the middle-aged jowly form of Agent SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS361
00:30:02,00 --> 00:30:08,50
She smiles at the staring slack-jawed agent with his face. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS362
00:30:06,00 --> 00:30:14,50
Dark scales flutter around her figure in waves as she shifts into her natural blue form. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS363
00:30:11,00 --> 00:30:16,50
SOMEONE drily faces SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS364
00:30:17,00 --> 00:30:23,50
A portly man in black, seated in a corner, speaks up. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS365
00:30:33,00 --> 00:30:37,50
Later in a hallway, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS366
00:30:43,00 --> 00:30:47,50
he freezes at a water fountain. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS367
00:30:46,00 --> 00:30:51,50
The arching water grazes his nose. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS368
00:31:00,00 --> 00:31:04,50
Now in a parking structure. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS369
00:31:31,00 --> 00:31:37,50
Nighttime. SOMEONE's anchored yacht looms before us, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS370
00:31:34,00 --> 00:31:39,50
its polished hull reading, "Caspartina." 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS371
00:31:37,00 --> 00:31:42,50
From the rippling water below, SOMEONE's head emerge 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS372
00:31:40,00 --> 00:31:46,50
He gazes intently at the extravagantly large luxury craft. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS373
00:31:44,00 --> 00:31:49,50
Later in a wetsuit, he creeps onboard. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS374
00:31:46,00 --> 00:31:53,50
Taking cover, he draws the Nazi's Blood and Honor knife from a boot sheath. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS375
00:31:51,00 --> 00:31:55,50
SOMEONE stalks out onto the main deck. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS376
00:31:54,00 --> 00:31:59,50
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the cyclone-maker stand. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS377
00:31:57,00 --> 00:32:02,50
Little SOMEONE Lensherr. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS378
00:31:59,00 --> 00:32:04,50
SOMEONE grins at the intruder. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS379
00:32:02,00 --> 00:32:06,50
SOMEONE's eyes narrow. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS380
00:32:04,00 --> 00:32:11,50
SOMEONE clutches his head and drops to his knees, as memories of SOMEONE torturing him flood his mind. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS382
00:32:12,00 --> 00:32:17,50
SOMEONE remembers his mother screaming. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS383
00:32:15,00 --> 00:32:19,50
After all these year 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS384
00:32:17,00 --> 00:32:22,50
he relives SOMEONE murdering her. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS385
00:32:19,00 --> 00:32:23,50
SOMEONE throws the knife. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS386
00:32:20,00 --> 00:32:26,50
Taking her diamond form, SOMEONE catches it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS387
00:32:23,00 --> 00:32:29,50
SOMEONE springs to his feet, but she punches him overboard. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS388
00:32:27,00 --> 00:32:31,50
She turns back to flesh and blood. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS389
00:32:30,00 --> 00:32:35,50
A military ship approaches. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS390
00:32:42,00 --> 00:32:49,50
Ahead of the ship, three motorized inflatable boats carry armed soldiers toward the yacht. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS392
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:55,50
SOMEONE narrows her eyes and our view of her fragments. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS394
00:33:11,00 --> 00:33:17,50
the motorized boats near the yacht, kicking up spray in their wake. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS395
00:33:14,00 --> 00:33:24,50
The cyclone-maker steps to the edge of the yacht deck and a whirlwind springs from each of his hands. He hurls them at the oncoming boats. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS396
00:33:22,00 --> 00:33:27,50
On the ship's deck, SOMEONE gawks. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS397
00:33:26,00 --> 00:33:31,50
The whirlwind knocks the boats high in the air. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS398
00:33:30,00 --> 00:33:39,50
In the water, SOMEONE lifts his arms. The yacht's anchor chains rise all around him. In a ship corridor. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS399
00:33:43,00 --> 00:33:49,50
Recovering, SOMEONE marches back out on the deck and points. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS400
00:33:48,00 --> 00:33:54,50
One of the yacht's anchors rises high above its deck. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS401
00:33:53,00 --> 00:33:58,50
SOMEONE thrusts a hand forward. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS402
00:33:55,00 --> 00:34:06,50
The anchor swoops down, crashes through the smokestack, and plows through the upper deck. It rises high as SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the man in black stare. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS403
00:34:03,00 --> 00:34:09,50
SOMEONE whips the anchor chain around the yacht's corridors. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS404
00:34:06,00 --> 00:34:16,50
Inside, SOMEONE and SOMEONE flee down a hallway as the chain slices through the walls. The upper cabins collapse in its wake. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS405
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:19,50
SOMEONE flings an arm and the anchor snaps loose. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS406
00:34:19,00 --> 00:34:27,50
Our view sinks beneath the water to find a hatch in the yacht's underside releasing a submarine. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS407
00:34:24,00 --> 00:34:34,50
Treading water, SOMEONE turns. As the underwater vessel pulls away, he grits his teeth and stretches his hands after it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS408
00:34:32,00 --> 00:34:42,50
The submarine shakes, but continues through the water as SOMEONE and his followers reach an all-white state-of-the-art bridge. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS409
00:34:39,00 --> 00:34:46,50
Water surges around SOMEONE's head as the vessel drags him in its wake. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS410
00:34:49,00 --> 00:34:54,50
On the ship, sailors gather on the decks. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS411
00:34:59,00 --> 00:35:04,50
The submarine drags SOMEONE beneath the water. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS412
00:35:01,00 --> 00:35:10,50
Completely submerged, he bares his gritted teeth, and keeps a stubborn hold on the submarine. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS413
00:35:07,00 --> 00:35:18,50
On the ship, SOMEONE runs along the deck, then dives from the edge. He plunges into the water behind SOMEONE and wraps his arms around him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS414
00:35:28,00 --> 00:35:39,50
Two veins throb in SOMEONE's forehead as SOMEONE drags him toward the surface. In the escaping submarine, SOMEONE shifts his smug gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS415
00:35:37,00 --> 00:35:41,50
The two mutants surface. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS416
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:04,50
SOMEONE smiles warmly at him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS417
00:36:04,00 --> 00:36:10,50
The haunted man regards him with a furrowed brow. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS419
00:36:09,00 --> 00:36:17,50
As we drift over a sprawling complex, words appear: "Covert CIA Research Base." 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS420
00:36:14,00 --> 00:36:22,50
On a lawn, a sphere stands on a pedestal, resembling a giant golf ball on a tee. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS421
00:36:19,00 --> 00:36:24,50
At a bustling entrance, a black car pulls up. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS422
00:36:22,00 --> 00:36:28,50
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, the man in black, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE get out. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS423
00:36:47,00 --> 00:36:54,50
Now a bespectacled young man shows a model of the stealth jet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS424
00:37:16,00 --> 00:37:21,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS425
00:37:21,00 --> 00:37:26,50
The man in black steps closer, his head cocked. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS426
00:37:34,00 --> 00:37:38,50
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS427
00:37:40,00 --> 00:37:47,50
The slim charmingly disheveled young man shifts his uncertain gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS428
00:37:45,00 --> 00:37:51,50
He gives a little shrug of the head, then kicks off his shoes. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS429
00:37:48,00 --> 00:37:53,50
He peels off his socks, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS430
00:37:50,00 --> 00:37:56,50
revealing large feet with long prehensile toes, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS431
00:37:53,00 --> 00:37:58,50
including opposable big toes. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS432
00:37:58,00 --> 00:38:04,50
SOMEONE notices the blonde SOMEONE beaming radiantly at him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS433
00:38:01,00 --> 00:38:07,50
He smiles pleasurably, then scoots past the group. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS434
00:38:06,00 --> 00:38:12,50
He leaps up, backflips, and catches hold of the model jet with his feet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS435
00:38:10,00 --> 00:38:14,50
He hangs upside down. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS436
00:38:12,00 --> 00:38:18,50
He swings gently as his feet grip the model tightly. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS437
00:38:16,00 --> 00:38:20,50
He stares, slack-jawed. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS438
00:38:17,00 --> 00:38:23,50
Smiling warmly, SOMEONE steps in close to SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS439
00:38:23,00 --> 00:38:29,50
Now a TV in a living room shows a news broadcast. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS440
00:38:50,00 --> 00:38:55,50
SOMEONE skeptically cocks her head. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS441
00:38:59,00 --> 00:39:05,50
SOMEONE crosses to a large hard case sitting on a desk. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS442
00:39:02,00 --> 00:39:08,50
He opens it and pulls out a sleek shiny helmet the color of pewter 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS443
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:11,50
designed to cover the entire head. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS444
00:39:09,00 --> 00:39:15,50
Steel-hued trim frames its specialized facial opening. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS445
00:39:13,00 --> 00:39:20,50
He puts it on, leaving only his eyes, nose, mouth, and chin exposed. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS446
00:39:20,00 --> 00:39:26,50
As SOMEONE faces SOMEONE, she exhales and lowers her chin. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS447
00:39:23,00 --> 00:39:29,50
She stares piercingly at SOMEONE, her eyes narrowing. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS448
00:39:26,00 --> 00:39:32,50
Relaxing, she tilts her head and cocks an eyebrow. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS449
00:39:37,00 --> 00:39:42,50
SOMEONE beams gratefully. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS450
00:39:39,00 --> 00:39:44,50
SOMEONE holds up a glass of liquor. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS451
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:47,50
SOMEONE's smile fade 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS452
00:39:48,00 --> 00:39:54,50
She takes the glass and crosses the stylish room to a hatch. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS453
00:39:52,00 --> 00:39:57,50
Opening the door, she heads into the submarine bridge. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS454
00:39:55,00 --> 00:40:01,50
SOMEONE and the cyclone-maker lower a ladder for her. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS455
00:39:58,00 --> 00:40:07,50
Now standing in an open upper hatch, SOMEONE's diamond hand cuts a plum-sized chunk of ice from a large formation. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS456
00:40:05,00 --> 00:40:10,50
As it plops into SOMEONE's drink, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS457
00:40:07,00 --> 00:40:13,50
we drift back and find the sub in the midst of a frozen sea. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS458
00:40:11,00 --> 00:40:16,50
In a recess at the lab, SOMEONE sits facing SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS459
00:41:19,00 --> 00:41:24,50
SOMEONE leans in close. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS460
00:41:23,00 --> 00:41:28,50
She lays her forearm across his lap. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS461
00:41:26,00 --> 00:41:33,50
SOMEONE rolls up her sleeve and swabs at a patch of her skin with a cotton ball. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS462
00:41:30,00 --> 00:41:36,50
He picks up a syringe and injects the needle into her vein. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS463
00:41:34,00 --> 00:41:37,50
SOMEONE winces. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS464
00:41:37,00 --> 00:41:42,50
She brings her full parted lips in toward his. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS465
00:41:40,00 --> 00:41:46,50
She straightens abruptly as SOMEONE strolls over. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS466
00:41:48,00 --> 00:41:53,50
SOMEONE presses his lips shut and swallow 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS467
00:41:51,00 --> 00:41:58,50
SOMEONE stares after SOMEONE as he saunters off, then faces SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS468
00:41:55,00 --> 00:42:01,50
The young man licks his lips and shifts his uneasy gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS469
00:41:59,00 --> 00:42:05,50
Now in a dimly lit office, SOMEONE searches a file cabinet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS470
00:42:03,00 --> 00:42:10,50
He brings out a folder, glances over his shoulder, and studies its cover. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS471
00:42:07,00 --> 00:42:11,50
It bears the CIA emblem, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS472
00:42:09,00 --> 00:42:13,50
SOMEONE's name, and a file number. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS473
00:42:11,00 --> 00:42:15,50
SOMEONE puts it in a briefcase. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS474
00:42:13,00 --> 00:42:16,50
Later he exits 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS475
00:42:14,00 --> 00:42:19,50
the complex, passing SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS476
00:42:38,00 --> 00:42:43,50
SOMEONE keeps his back to SOMEONE, his gaze vulnerable. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS477
00:42:41,00 --> 00:42:45,50
He smiles bitterly. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS478
00:42:43,00 --> 00:42:48,50
He faces the compassionate young man. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS479
00:43:01,00 --> 00:43:07,50
SOMEONE stands motionless, his wary gaze fixed on SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS480
00:43:06,00 --> 00:43:12,50
SOMEONE backs away a few feet, then turns and heads toward the building. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS481
00:43:13,00 --> 00:43:18,50
SOMEONE looks away, uncertain. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS482
00:43:17,00 --> 00:43:23,50
Now SOMEONE looks at the giant golf-ball-like structure. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS483
00:43:33,00 --> 00:43:37,50
SOMEONE smile 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS484
00:43:36,00 --> 00:43:41,50
With a nod, SOMEONE eyes the man in black. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS485
00:43:53,00 --> 00:43:57,50
SOMEONE considers SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS486
00:44:01,00 --> 00:44:06,50
The supervising agent gapes. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS487
00:44:08,00 --> 00:44:17,50
As the man in black holds SOMEONE's smug gaze, our view zooms out a window, which frames the transmitter. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS488
00:44:15,00 --> 00:44:22,50
Now SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE find SOMEONE inside the transmitter's spherical room. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS489
00:44:41,00 --> 00:44:47,50
SOMEONE pulls on a helmet attached to a network of wire 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS490
00:44:56,00 --> 00:45:05,50
SOMEONE flips switches on a control board as SOMEONE waits atop a circular platform at the room's center. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS491
00:45:02,00 --> 00:45:09,50
Furrowing his brow, SOMEONE scrutinizes his telepathic colleague. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS492
00:45:06,00 --> 00:45:13,50
As SOMEONE closes his eyes, SOMEONE watches with an anxious look. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS493
00:45:10,00 --> 00:45:20,50
SOMEONE flips more switches and a strip of paper begins to move like a conveyor belt under the arms of a chart recorder. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS494
00:45:17,00 --> 00:45:22,50
White light glows down on SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS495
00:45:20,00 --> 00:45:36,50
He clutches railings at his sides. His chest heaves as he envisions shooting into the air past hundreds of humans. Emerging on a blanket of clouds, his gaze sweeps from three girls, to a man reading a book, to a dark-skinned girl with white hair. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS496
00:45:33,00 --> 00:45:37,50
He smiles. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS497
00:45:34,00 --> 00:45:40,50
SOMEONE finds a girl being examined by an eye doctor. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS498
00:45:38,00 --> 00:45:43,50
In the transmitter, SOMEONE watches a printer. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS499
00:45:42,00 --> 00:45:46,50
SOMEONE grins. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS500
00:45:44,00 --> 00:45:50,50
His mind's eye zooms from person to person in the clouds, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS501
00:45:47,00 --> 00:45:55,50
then focuses on a black-haired young woman in booty shoots and a bra with dangling fringe. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS502
00:45:52,00 --> 00:45:58,50
The clouds clear away to show her standing on a bar in a night club. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS503
00:45:56,00 --> 00:46:01,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE now sit in front of her. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS504
00:45:58,00 --> 00:46:02,50
SOMEONE shows her some money. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS505
00:46:02,00 --> 00:46:09,50
Later in a private room, SOMEONE and SOMEONE clink their glasses. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS506
00:46:19,00 --> 00:46:25,50
SOMEONE snaps and an ice bucket with champagne rises. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS507
00:46:24,00 --> 00:46:30,50
As they look at her, the young woman twitches a smile. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS508
00:46:29,00 --> 00:46:33,50
Reaching behind her back, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS509
00:46:30,00 --> 00:46:42,50
she unhooks her bra and a web-like tattoo of four dragonfly wings morphs into real ones. As they flutter rapidly, the young woman rises into the air. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS510
00:46:40,00 --> 00:46:48,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE exchange an amazed look, then return their attention to the hovering dancer. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS511
00:46:49,00 --> 00:46:55,50
Back at the transmitter, the printer types more coordinates. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS512
00:46:52,00 --> 00:46:58,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE climb into a cab. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS513
00:47:07,00 --> 00:47:14,50
SOMEONE guides the meter's arm down. Later the recruiters walk a prison corridor. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS514
00:47:20,00 --> 00:47:25,50
The warden opens a cell. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS515
00:47:22,00 --> 00:47:29,50
Sitting on a bench inside, a brawny young man with blonde hair lifts his gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS516
00:47:27,00 --> 00:47:33,50
Now in an aquarium, a teenaged boy and girl face a fish tank. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS517
00:47:39,00 --> 00:47:44,50
The pretty teen gives him a haughty look. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS518
00:47:43,00 --> 00:47:49,50
As she turns away, the shaggy-haired boy blows at the tank. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS519
00:47:46,00 --> 00:47:52,50
The water inside ripples, driving the fish off. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS520
00:47:51,00 --> 00:47:57,50
The girl turns back to the tank and finds all of the fish gone. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS521
00:47:54,00 --> 00:47:59,50
With a perplexed look, she hurries off. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS522
00:47:57,00 --> 00:48:03,50
As the boy turns back to the tank, SOMEONE and SOMEONE step up behind him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS523
00:48:01,00 --> 00:48:08,50
Later the recruiters enter a pub where Logan sits at the bar. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS524
00:48:06,00 --> 00:48:12,50
They approach the troubled man as he lifts a cigar to his lips. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS525
00:48:13,00 --> 00:48:21,50
Logan puffs on his cigar and the two recruiters exchange a resigned look. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS526
00:48:18,00 --> 00:48:27,50
As they head out the door, he stares over his shoulder after them, then downs his drink and gestures for another. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS527
00:48:24,00 --> 00:48:30,50
Now a view through a periscope sweeps across a vacant ocean. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS528
00:48:28,00 --> 00:48:35,50
Inside SOMEONE's sub, SOMEONE removes her eyes from the viewfinder and turns to SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS529
00:48:40,00 --> 00:48:47,50
Striding out of the bridge, she enters the adjacent living room and office area. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS530
00:48:45,00 --> 00:48:52,50
She opens a small metal box on a desk and pushes a button inside. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS531
00:48:49,00 --> 00:48:55,50
Two sections of wall separate to reveal a secret doorway. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS532
00:48:53,00 --> 00:49:01,50
Entering a room covered in mirrored panels, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE staring down at a waist-high nuclear reactor. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS533
00:49:16,00 --> 00:49:22,50
SOMEONE's chest heaves and his eyes harden. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS534
00:49:25,00 --> 00:49:30,50
Now on the steps of the SOMEONE Memorial. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS535
00:50:00,00 --> 00:50:09,50
Nighttime. At the research base, SOMEONE and the young recruit sit in a rec room with a large window overlooking a courtyard. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS536
00:50:16,00 --> 00:50:21,50
She morphs into the shaggy-haired boy. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS537
00:50:22,00 --> 00:50:26,50
She transforms back. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS538
00:50:33,00 --> 00:50:37,50
He strides over to a fish tank. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS539
00:50:35,00 --> 00:50:41,50
As he sticks his head under water, gills appear on either side. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS540
00:50:39,00 --> 00:50:44,50
He opens his mouth and breathe 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS541
00:50:44,00 --> 00:50:49,50
He grins at the others, then lifts his head out. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS542
00:50:51,00 --> 00:50:56,50
The shaggy-haired boy stares thoughtfully. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS543
00:50:58,00 --> 00:51:04,50
With puzzled looks, the others press their hands to their ear 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS544
00:51:04,00 --> 00:51:10,50
SOMEONE smiles, then releases a gust of sound. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS545
00:51:08,00 --> 00:51:13,50
It hits the window and shatters it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS546
00:51:10,00 --> 00:51:15,50
SOMEONE turns to the black-haired exotic dancer. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS547
00:51:18,00 --> 00:51:22,50
She shows her wing. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS548
00:51:23,00 --> 00:51:32,50
She spits a ball of fire, which soars out through the shattered window, and ignites the head of a statue in the courtyard. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS549
00:51:29,00 --> 00:51:33,50
She gives SOMEONE a nod. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS550
00:51:33,00 --> 00:51:37,50
He looks away. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS551
00:51:42,00 --> 00:51:46,50
SOMEONE shoots SOMEONE a smile. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS552
00:51:59,00 --> 00:52:04,50
SOMEONE rises from his chair. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS553
00:52:07,00 --> 00:52:13,50
SOMEONE climbs out the broken window and enters the courtyard. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS554
00:52:10,00 --> 00:52:15,50
The others peer through the window at him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS555
00:52:13,00 --> 00:52:20,50
They retreat behind the wall, then lean their bodies to look out the window again. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS556
00:52:19,00 --> 00:52:24,50
They remain in position. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS557
00:52:22,00 --> 00:52:28,50
Clenching his fists, he swivels his hips and shoulders. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS558
00:52:25,00 --> 00:52:32,50
Red rings of energy swirl around him and shoot off like discs. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS559
00:52:29,00 --> 00:52:36,50
One cuts the statue in half, leaving flames along the sever line. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS560
00:52:34,00 --> 00:52:39,50
Now in a meeting with SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS561
00:53:01,00 --> 00:53:05,50
Later at the research base. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS562
00:53:10,00 --> 00:53:16,50
through the window into the rec room, they see SOMEONE dancing on a couch. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS563
00:53:13,00 --> 00:53:20,50
Angel hovers in the air beside SOMEONE, who hangs upside-down from the ceiling. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS564
00:53:17,00 --> 00:53:24,50
SOMEONE wears scaly armor as SOMEONE slams him with a piece of metal. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS565
00:53:23,00 --> 00:53:30,50
With her hands on her hips, SOMEONE gapes at the rowdy youngster 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS566
00:53:30,00 --> 00:53:37,50
SOMEONE and Angel stop dancing. SOMEONE flips down and SOMEONE's armor melts away. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS567
00:53:45,00 --> 00:53:50,50
She points at SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS568
00:53:48,00 --> 00:53:52,50
She grins at SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS569
00:53:51,00 --> 00:53:58,50
He gives the recruits a dry look. As he and SOMEONE leave, SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS570
00:53:57,00 --> 00:54:03,50
SOMEONE stares dejectedly as he heads off. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS571
00:54:00,00 --> 00:54:07,50
Now our view drifts away from a mansion on a vast countryside estate. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS572
00:54:04,00 --> 00:54:09,50
Words appear: "Russian Military Retreat." 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS573
00:54:07,00 --> 00:54:14,50
As a truck trundles down a road into a thick barrier of trees bordering the estate, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS574
00:54:12,00 --> 00:54:16,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE ride in back. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS575
00:54:14,00 --> 00:54:21,50
Lifting a hatch, they peer into the cab, where SOMEONE sits beside SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS576
00:54:22,00 --> 00:54:29,50
Craning his neck, SOMEONE looks down at the road and sees soldiers guarding a roadblock up ahead. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS577
00:54:31,00 --> 00:54:36,50
He faces soldiers in back with him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS578
00:54:34,00 --> 00:54:40,50
They arrive at the roadblock and a soldier approaches. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS580
00:54:40,00 --> 00:54:45,50
A dog pulls a soldier toward the truck. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS583
00:54:45,00 --> 00:54:52,50
As SOMEONE heads to the back, the soldiers inside raise their gun 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS584
00:54:52,00 --> 00:54:56,50
SOMEONE touches his temple. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS585
00:54:53,00 --> 00:55:00,50
The dog sniffs around the vehicle and SOMEONE leads a soldier to the truck's rear. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS586
00:54:58,00 --> 00:55:08,50
Throwing open its doors, he finds it empty. Standing among the soldiers with drawn weapons, SOMEONE keeps his fingers on his temple. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS590
00:55:12,00 --> 00:55:17,50
SOMEONE turns to the soldier 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS592
00:55:17,00 --> 00:55:23,50
As he swings the doors closed, SOMEONE lowers his hand. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS593
00:55:20,00 --> 00:55:26,50
His shoulders sag in relief and SOMEONE pats his knee. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS594
00:55:24,00 --> 00:55:31,50
Later a view through binoculars shows a helicopter landing at the military retreat. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS595
00:55:28,00 --> 00:55:37,50
Hidden behind a hill, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE watch as SOMEONE climbs off the chopper and heads toward the mansion. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS596
00:55:35,00 --> 00:55:40,50
With puzzled looks, they lower their binocular 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS597
00:55:47,00 --> 00:55:54,50
As he touches his temple, SOMEONE and SOMEONE raise their binoculars again. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS598
00:55:51,00 --> 00:55:58,50
SOMEONE's mind's eye zooms past a barbed-wire fence protecting the mansion 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS599
00:55:55,00 --> 00:56:01,50
to a soldier standing guard at its portico. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS600
00:55:58,00 --> 00:56:07,50
The Russian man blinks as if dazed, then shifts his gaze to SOMEONE as she greets a mustached general. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS601
00:56:16,00 --> 00:56:22,50
The general escorts her inside and SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS602
00:56:19,00 --> 00:56:24,50
The telepath frowns. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS603
00:56:22,00 --> 00:56:27,50
The violated Russian soldier gives a puzzled look. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS604
00:56:39,00 --> 00:56:43,50
He runs off. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS605
00:56:41,00 --> 00:56:47,50
Meanwhile in a bedroom, the general toasts with SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS607
00:56:46,00 --> 00:56:51,50
He drains his drink and SOMEONE sips her 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS608
00:56:48,00 --> 00:56:53,50
They set down their glasses. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS609
00:57:01,00 --> 00:57:07,50
With a seductive look, she rises from a couch. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS610
00:57:06,00 --> 00:57:10,50
She undoes the belt on her dress. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS611
00:57:09,00 --> 00:57:15,50
She lowers her zipper, which trails from her collar to the hem of her skirt. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS612
00:57:13,00 --> 00:57:18,50
The general stares with hungry eyes. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS613
00:57:15,00 --> 00:57:25,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE watch through binoculars as coils of the barbed-wire fence wrap around soldiers guarding it 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS614
00:57:22,00 --> 00:57:26,50
and pull them to the ground. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS615
00:57:32,00 --> 00:57:40,50
SOMEONE directs a gate to lift and sprints underneath. As the guards by the portico aim their weapons, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS616
00:57:37,00 --> 00:57:46,50
SOMEONE extends his arms, drawing the soldiers toward him, then pulls his elbows down, causing them to fall. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS617
00:57:43,00 --> 00:57:48,50
He kicks one as he races past. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS618
00:57:45,00 --> 00:57:49,50
SOMEONE turns to SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS619
00:57:49,00 --> 00:57:54,50
Now SOMEONE enters the mansion. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS620
00:57:51,00 --> 00:57:59,50
As two soldiers aim their weapons, he commands the guns to disassemble, then hurls them into the ground. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS621
00:57:57,00 --> 00:58:03,50
Outside, SOMEONE spots a soldier wrapped in barbed wire. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS622
00:58:03,00 --> 00:58:06,50
He hurries over. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS624
00:58:06,00 --> 00:58:12,50
He touches the soldier's cheek. Forget my face. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS625
00:58:09,00 --> 00:58:15,50
The Russian's eyes close and his head drops. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS626
00:58:12,00 --> 00:58:16,50
SOMEONE rushes to the mansion. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS627
00:58:14,00 --> 00:58:20,50
In the bedroom, the general sits on the bed, with SOMEONE straddling him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS628
00:58:18,00 --> 00:58:23,50
The real SOMEONE watches from the couch. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS629
00:58:23,00 --> 00:58:29,50
Dressed in only her underwear, she nibbles a cracker. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS630
00:58:26,00 --> 00:58:34,50
Bursting into the room, SOMEONE and SOMEONE find the mustached general fondling his imaginary woman. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS631
00:58:31,00 --> 00:58:36,50
They exchange a look and SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS632
00:58:36,00 --> 00:58:41,50
Coming out of his trance, the general glare. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS634
00:58:41,00 --> 00:58:46,50
As he reaches for his gun, SOMEONE points at him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS635
00:58:46,00 --> 00:58:51,50
The general falls back and passes out. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS636
00:58:48,00 --> 00:58:53,50
Standing, SOMEONE morphs into her diamond form. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS637
00:58:51,00 --> 00:58:56,50
With his eyes fixed on her, SOMEONE touches his temple. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS638
00:58:56,00 --> 00:59:01,50
SOMEONE winces. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS639
00:59:00,00 --> 00:59:05,50
He glances at SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS640
00:59:02,00 --> 00:59:09,50
As SOMEONE sprints to the door, the men each grab an arm and wrestle her to the brass bed frame, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS641
00:59:06,00 --> 00:59:11,50
where they hold her against the foot board. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS642
00:59:09,00 --> 00:59:14,50
SOMEONE commands its bars to wrap around her wrists. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS643
00:59:15,00 --> 00:59:20,50
He bends the frame to hold her tighter. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS644
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:27,50
His chest heaves. As SOMEONE struggles against her restraints, he directs a bar to wrap around her neck. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS645
00:59:27,00 --> 00:59:33,50
He commands two more and they each bind an arm just below the shoulder. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS646
00:59:30,00 --> 00:59:36,50
SOMEONE's brow creases in a pained look. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS647
00:59:35,00 --> 00:59:39,50
SOMEONE shakes his head. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS648
00:59:37,00 --> 00:59:43,50
Sucking in ragged breaths, he controls the bar around SOMEONE's neck, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS649
00:59:40,00 --> 00:59:45,50
making it squeeze even tighter. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS650
00:59:42,00 --> 00:59:47,50
SOMEONE's chest heaves. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS651
00:59:45,00 --> 00:59:51,50
The metal wrings SOMEONE's diamond skin, causing a crack around her neck. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS652
00:59:49,00 --> 00:59:56,50
As SOMEONE releases the bar strangling her, the captive morphs back into her human form. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS653
00:59:56,00 --> 00:59:59,50
He turns away. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS654
01:00:03,00 --> 01:00:08,50
He prepares himself a cracker. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS655
01:00:05,00 --> 01:00:11,50
Gazing intently at SOMEONE, SOMEONE touches his temple. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS656
01:00:08,00 --> 01:00:14,50
In her mind, he sees the United States on a world map. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS657
01:00:12,00 --> 01:00:19,50
The focus shifts as SOMEONE places a magnet of a missile on top of Cuba. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS658
01:00:16,00 --> 01:00:24,50
Warheads soar around a globe, launching from the United States and landing in Russia. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS659
01:00:21,00 --> 01:00:28,50
As they detonate, missiles fly from Russia to the US and explode. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS660
01:00:25,00 --> 01:00:31,50
A burst of fire gives way to a mushroom cloud. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS661
01:00:38,00 --> 01:00:46,50
Another vision shows the Capitol building now in ruins amid a destroyed cityscape. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS662
01:00:45,00 --> 01:00:50,50
SOMEONE lowers his hand, then turns to SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS663
01:00:50,00 --> 01:00:55,50
He shifts his gaze back to SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS664
01:01:01,00 --> 01:01:05,50
SOMEONE gives a troubled look. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS665
01:01:02,00 --> 01:01:10,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE watches a score display as SOMEONE plays pinball in the rec room. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS666
01:01:14,00 --> 01:01:22,50
In the courtyard, two agents pass the window and look in at Angel, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS667
01:01:24,00 --> 01:01:28,50
He mimes flying. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS668
01:01:27,00 --> 01:01:31,50
SOMEONE stands. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS669
01:01:29,00 --> 01:01:37,50
With a sarcastic salute, SOMEONE draws curtains over the window, then sits again. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS675
01:01:48,00 --> 01:01:53,50
SOMEONE lowers her thoughtful gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS676
01:01:52,00 --> 01:01:57,50
She returns her eyes to Angel, who looks away. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS677
01:01:55,00 --> 01:01:59,50
The recruits glance around. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS679
01:01:57,00 --> 01:02:02,50
SOMEONE turns from the pinball machine. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS681
01:02:02,00 --> 01:02:07,50
As he strides to the window, SOMEONE follows. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS682
01:02:04,00 --> 01:02:09,50
The others rise from their seats. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS683
01:02:06,00 --> 01:02:13,50
SOMEONE opens the curtains. Meanwhile in the man in black's office, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS687
01:02:16,00 --> 01:02:23,50
As the man in black steps toward his window, SOMEONE materializes behind him, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS688
01:02:21,00 --> 01:02:26,50
grabs the subordinate agent, then disappears with him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS689
01:02:24,00 --> 01:02:32,50
Reappearing, he grabs the supervising agent and teleports him into the sky above the base. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS690
01:02:30,00 --> 01:02:37,50
The recruits watch through the window as SOMEONE releases the man in black, then disappear 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS691
01:02:35,00 --> 01:02:40,50
The portly agent plummets to the courtyard. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS692
01:02:37,00 --> 01:02:43,50
Now more CIA agents rain from the sky. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS693
01:02:40,00 --> 01:02:46,50
One crashes through a skylight in the rec room. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS694
01:02:43,00 --> 01:02:50,50
As SOMEONE enters the building wearing the helmet, an agent talks into a radio. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS695
01:02:54,00 --> 01:02:59,50
SOMEONE absorbs his bullets. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS696
01:02:57,00 --> 01:03:02,50
SOMEONE lifts him by the throat. Meanwhile, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS697
01:03:02,00 --> 01:03:09,50
the recruits watch through the window as SOMEONE appears in the courtyard. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS698
01:03:06,00 --> 01:03:11,50
The agents open fire, but SOMEONE disappears. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS699
01:03:09,00 --> 01:03:16,50
The mutant materializes next to an agent and forces him to fire into the room. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS700
01:03:13,00 --> 01:03:22,50
The young mutants see a cyclone pass by the transmitter. In the main atrium, the agent dangles in SOMEONE's grasp. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS701
01:03:23,00 --> 01:03:32,50
A team of soldiers surrounding him cock their weapons. SOMEONE launches his captive into the air and the team fires. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS702
01:03:29,00 --> 01:03:33,50
As he absorbs the bullets, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS703
01:03:31,00 --> 01:03:38,50
SOMEONE's arms appear to split at the elbow, replicate into three forearms, then rejoin. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS704
01:03:35,00 --> 01:03:44,50
A soldier fires a rocket launcher. Flames engulf the SOMEONE, then shrink into his hands as he absorbs the energy. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS705
01:03:42,00 --> 01:03:48,50
Meanwhile, the recruits watches SOMEONE slay agents in the courtyard. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS706
01:03:51,00 --> 01:03:57,50
SOMEONE spears a man in the chest with his devil's tail. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS707
01:03:54,00 --> 01:04:00,50
As the recruits race down a hall, soldiers stop them. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS708
01:03:58,00 --> 01:04:06,50
In the atrium, SOMEONE stomps his foot and a glowing pulse of energy cracks the floor underneath. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS709
01:04:04,00 --> 01:04:09,50
It spreads to the wall, then surges around the room 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS710
01:04:07,00 --> 01:04:12,50
taking out the balcony and the soldiers along with it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS711
01:04:09,00 --> 01:04:15,50
In the hallway, the recruits and soldiers duck. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS712
01:04:12,00 --> 01:04:19,50
Standing at the atrium's center, SOMEONE directs the roiling flames with his gaze 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS713
01:04:17,00 --> 01:04:22,50
and the recruits retreat down the hall. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS714
01:04:19,00 --> 01:04:25,50
Racing into a small lunch room, they see the cyclone through a window. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS715
01:04:23,00 --> 01:04:29,50
The swirling wind engulfs the transmitter, ripping it apart. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS716
01:04:26,00 --> 01:04:37,50
The recruits turn to the other window and find SOMEONE slaying soldiers and agents. Strangling a man with his tail, he uses him as a shield against an agent with a gun. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS717
01:04:35,00 --> 01:04:42,50
The agent accidentally shoots SOMEONE's hostage and the teleporter vanishes. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS718
01:04:39,00 --> 01:04:46,50
The cyclone outside hurls a man into the window and shatters it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS719
01:04:43,00 --> 01:04:49,50
At the other window, SOMEONE appears in front of a trembling agent. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS720
01:04:46,00 --> 01:04:52,50
The mutant easily dispatches him, stabbing him in the back. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS721
01:04:49,00 --> 01:04:55,50
The cyclone-maker climbs through the broken window. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS722
01:04:52,00 --> 01:04:58,50
The recruits turn to see SOMEONE coming in from the other side. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS723
01:05:07,00 --> 01:05:11,50
The door open 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS724
01:05:08,00 --> 01:05:14,50
SOMEONE steps in and faces the huddle of terrified young recruit 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS725
01:05:20,00 --> 01:05:25,50
He removes the anti-telepathy helmet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS726
01:05:30,00 --> 01:05:35,50
Outside, a soldier aims. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS727
01:05:33,00 --> 01:05:39,50
The devilish mutant materializes in the courtyard and kills him with a sword. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS728
01:05:47,00 --> 01:05:52,50
He faces SOMEONE pointedly. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS729
01:06:10,00 --> 01:06:14,50
SOMEONE looks away. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS730
01:06:12,00 --> 01:06:18,50
SOMEONE's gaze falls on Angel and grows seductively tender. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS731
01:06:18,00 --> 01:06:25,50
With a vulnerable pout, the young woman swallows and looks down at his extended hand. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS732
01:06:24,00 --> 01:06:30,50
She accepts it and SOMEONE leads her to the shattered window. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS733
01:06:37,00 --> 01:06:44,50
SOMEONE reaches out to her, but she turns away and continues out with SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS734
01:06:44,00 --> 01:06:52,50
The young man lowers his arm as she steps through the window with SOMEONE and the cyclone-maker. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS735
01:06:49,00 --> 01:06:54,50
SOMEONE lowers his woeful gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS736
01:06:51,00 --> 01:06:57,50
He sighs heavily and his expression grows resolute. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS737
01:06:55,00 --> 01:07:02,50
He faces SOMEONE who scowls as SOMEONE speaks. The young men trade angry shove 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS738
01:07:03,00 --> 01:07:09,50
As he comes outside, Angel smirks. SOMEONE smiles and meets him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS739
01:07:13,00 --> 01:07:19,50
Behind him, the other young mutants form a line. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS740
01:07:20,00 --> 01:07:26,50
SOMEONE sweeps an arm behind him in a welcoming gesture. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS741
01:07:23,00 --> 01:07:29,50
SOMEONE joins Angel at her side and faces the other 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS742
01:07:30,00 --> 01:07:35,50
He shields her with his body and turns to stone. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS743
01:07:32,00 --> 01:07:38,50
SOMEONE hurls an energy ring, but SOMEONE catches it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS744
01:07:37,00 --> 01:07:40,50
He absorbs it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS745
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:45,50
SOMEONE swings at him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS746
01:07:42,00 --> 01:07:49,50
SOMEONE blocks his punch, then grabs him by the jaw, forcing his mouth open. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS748
01:07:49,00 --> 01:07:56,50
He forces a compact mass of the energy between SOMEONE's lips, then releases him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS749
01:07:54,00 --> 01:08:02,50
Angel stares sadly at her friend as SOMEONE and his team join hands, then disappear with SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS750
01:08:00,00 --> 01:08:05,50
SOMEONE convulses, his form turning metallic. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS751
01:08:03,00 --> 01:08:08,50
It takes on the appearance of volcanic rock 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS752
01:08:05,00 --> 01:08:10,50
with lava beneath the surface. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS753
01:08:08,00 --> 01:08:13,50
SOMEONE steadies himself and becomes stone, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS754
01:08:10,00 --> 01:08:16,50
appearing to subdue the combustion of his body. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS755
01:08:13,00 --> 01:08:18,50
He faces SOMEONE, whose eyes widen. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS756
01:08:15,00 --> 01:08:22,50
SOMEONE reaches out to him, resuming his flesh-and-blood form. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS757
01:08:19,00 --> 01:08:24,50
Brilliant light shines out through cracks in his skin. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS758
01:08:22,00 --> 01:08:27,50
It consumes him, then overwhelms our view. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS759
01:08:26,00 --> 01:08:34,50
In Moscow, the Russian general looks out at a military parade through from a balcony. He goes inside. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS761
01:08:35,00 --> 01:08:39,50
He shakes SOMEONE's hand. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS762
01:08:37,00 --> 01:08:44,50
Once again, my sympathies for your treatment at the hands of the CIA. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS763
01:08:41,00 --> 01:08:46,50
These Americans are ruthless. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS764
01:08:43,00 --> 01:08:48,50
Now they have their missiles placed in Turkey. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS765
01:08:46,00 --> 01:08:55,50
He arrives at a world map highlighting the United States and Soviet Union, then points out the strategic location. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS770
01:09:06,00 --> 01:09:14,50
He plants a missile-shaped crimson marker over a sizable island southeast of the Floridian coast. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS773
01:09:19,00 --> 01:09:23,50
He steps in close to SOMEONE and removes the marker. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS775
01:09:30,00 --> 01:09:36,50
The general stares at him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS777
01:09:37,00 --> 01:09:44,50
He marches to a phone on one of the long tables and picks it up. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS779
01:09:46,00 --> 01:09:52,50
SOMEONE, Angel, and the cyclone-maker appear before him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS781
01:09:50,00 --> 01:09:56,50
He fearfully lowers the phone, then looks back at SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS782
01:09:54,00 --> 01:10:00,50
The evil mutant leader smiles and holds out his hands. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS783
01:09:57,00 --> 01:10:02,50
The general faces SOMEONE's menacing team. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS784
01:10:00,00 --> 01:10:06,50
Now a black car arrives outside the devastated research facility. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS785
01:10:03,00 --> 01:10:08,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE rush out. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS786
01:10:07,00 --> 01:10:12,50
They find the remaining teens on a bench. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS787
01:10:09,00 --> 01:10:16,50
As SOMEONE embraces his adopted sister, SOMEONE joins the group. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS788
01:10:28,00 --> 01:10:33,50
SOMEONE hangs his head and SOMEONE looks away. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS789
01:10:32,00 --> 01:10:36,50
All eyes turn on SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS790
01:10:38,00 --> 01:10:42,50
SOMEONE takes him aside. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS791
01:10:47,00 --> 01:10:54,50
SOMEONE faces the group, his angular features set in a grim frown. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS792
01:11:06,00 --> 01:11:11,50
SOMEONE yields a faint comforting smile. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS793
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:14,50
Now SOMEONE sits in a small room. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS794
01:11:28,00 --> 01:11:34,50
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch from an observation room, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS795
01:11:31,00 --> 01:11:36,50
SOMEONE stands and strides confidently to the window. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS796
01:11:34,00 --> 01:11:41,50
Her finger crystallizes and she uses it to cut a circle in the glass. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS797
01:11:38,00 --> 01:11:44,50
The mutant lightly taps it and it drops out of the window. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS798
01:11:51,00 --> 01:11:59,50
Now a massive Russian ship, named Aral Sea, slowly moves across the ocean. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS799
01:11:56,00 --> 01:12:03,50
The captain and a few crew members stand vigilantly on the control bridge. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS800
01:12:01,00 --> 01:12:06,50
Captain, no sign of any American ships. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS801
01:12:03,00 --> 01:12:08,50
Maintain course. Full ahead. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS802
01:12:05,00 --> 01:12:09,50
At the Pentagon. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS803
01:12:27,00 --> 01:12:33,50
Around the ring-shaped table, officials raise their hands unanimously. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS804
01:12:34,00 --> 01:12:39,50
Now on the Xavier estate's verdant grounds. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS805
01:12:41,00 --> 01:12:48,50
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and the teens stare up at the palatial manor house. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS806
01:12:55,00 --> 01:13:00,50
SOMEONE gratefully kisses SOMEONE's blonde head. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS807
01:13:00,00 --> 01:13:07,50
She leads the group off a gravel driveway and around the side of the mansion. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS808
01:13:05,00 --> 01:13:11,50
Now words appear beneath a gray, overcast public square. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS809
01:13:08,00 --> 01:13:14,50
Moscow, Russia. In the Soviet war room. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS810
01:13:14,00 --> 01:13:21,50
Dear comrades, the United States have dispatched warships for Cuba. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS811
01:13:18,00 --> 01:13:23,50
This leaves us no choice. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS812
01:13:23,00 --> 01:13:29,50
The general circles the packed room, indicating the map with a long pointer. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS813
01:13:27,00 --> 01:13:32,50
He halts before a central table. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS814
01:13:30,00 --> 01:13:36,50
Comrade First Secretary, we must send in our fleet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS815
01:13:33,00 --> 01:13:41,50
A bald man whispers with two colleagues on either side of him, then gives a nod. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS816
01:13:38,00 --> 01:13:42,50
Dispatch the fleet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS817
01:13:40,00 --> 01:13:44,50
The scene freezes in a photo. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS818
01:13:42,00 --> 01:13:48,50
Panels featuring newsreels and headlines fill the screen. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS819
01:14:00,00 --> 01:14:06,50
Blossoming mushroom clouds fill the panels, which vanish. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS820
01:14:03,00 --> 01:14:10,50
The remaining two converge to reveal SOMEONE aiming a gun on his estate. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS821
01:14:08,00 --> 01:14:13,50
His hand shakes as he cocks it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS822
01:14:15,00 --> 01:14:20,50
SOMEONE stands before him, the gun pointed at his head. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS823
01:14:18,00 --> 01:14:24,50
SOMEONE takes a deep breath as his companion grins eagerly. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS824
01:14:40,00 --> 01:14:43,50
He takes the gun. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS825
01:14:54,00 --> 01:14:59,50
Now in a long arched chamber, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS826
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:04,50
SOMEONE sets up a mannequin. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS827
01:15:23,00 --> 01:15:29,50
Now outside, SOMEONE shatters panes of glass. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS828
01:15:35,00 --> 01:15:40,50
Now SOMEONE runs laps with SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS829
01:15:56,00 --> 01:16:00,50
In the bunker. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS830
01:16:03,00 --> 01:16:09,50
SOMEONE steps out and closes a heavy-duty hatch. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS831
01:16:07,00 --> 01:16:11,50
He presses an ear to the door. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS832
01:16:10,00 --> 01:16:17,50
Opening it, he finds the bunker's arch-shaped support beams in flames. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS833
01:16:16,00 --> 01:16:22,50
He grabs an extinguisher and hurriedly puts out the fire. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS834
01:16:22,00 --> 01:16:28,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE fit SOMEONE with cloth-wing attachments. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS835
01:16:31,00 --> 01:16:35,50
At a window. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS836
01:16:45,00 --> 01:16:52,50
Sitting on the window's ledge, SOMEONE crosses himself, then spreads his wings. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS837
01:16:50,00 --> 01:16:54,50
He pitches off the window. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS838
01:16:52,00 --> 01:16:56,50
He plummets. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS839
01:16:53,00 --> 01:16:58,50
Now SOMEONE stands with SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS840
01:16:58,00 --> 01:17:03,50
SOMEONE stretches his bare feet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS841
01:17:04,00 --> 01:17:08,50
They race down the driveway. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS842
01:17:06,00 --> 01:17:13,50
SOMEONE pulls in front, then disappears ahead of SOMEONE, who pumps his arms as he sprints. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS843
01:17:11,00 --> 01:17:18,50
In a blur of motion, SOMEONE appears behind SOMEONE, then catches up and taps his shoulder. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS844
01:17:17,00 --> 01:17:22,50
Stopping, SOMEONE shakes his head. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS845
01:17:23,00 --> 01:17:27,50
SOMEONE saunters over. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS846
01:17:29,00 --> 01:17:34,50
He slaps his back. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS847
01:17:32,00 --> 01:17:36,50
SOMEONE trudges away. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS848
01:17:35,00 --> 01:17:40,50
Passing a window, he sees SOMEONE inside. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS849
01:17:37,00 --> 01:17:44,50
She waves and he gives her a half-hearted smile as he returns the gesture. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS850
01:17:42,00 --> 01:17:49,50
Now as SOMEONE does bench presses, the barbell lifts out of her hands. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS851
01:17:54,00 --> 01:17:59,50
He releases the barbell. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS852
01:17:56,00 --> 01:18:02,50
SOMEONE morphs into her true form as she catches it. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS853
01:18:04,00 --> 01:18:09,50
SOMEONE stares after him as he strides away. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS854
01:18:07,00 --> 01:18:13,50
Now SOMEONE wears a vest with a circular panel on its chest. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS855
01:18:25,00 --> 01:18:32,50
Facing three mannequins, SOMEONE shoots a shaft of energy from his chest. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS856
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:34,50
He destroys the one on the left. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS857
01:18:31,00 --> 01:18:36,50
He tries again and the blast knocks him over. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS858
01:18:34,00 --> 01:18:41,50
Only the middle mannequin remains standing. Later SOMEONE joins SOMEONE in a lab. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS859
01:18:47,00 --> 01:18:53,50
Sitting on his lap, SOMEONE peers into his microscope. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS860
01:18:50,00 --> 01:18:55,50
Now on top of a giant satellite dish. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS861
01:18:59,00 --> 01:19:03,50
SOMEONE closes his mouth. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS862
01:19:06,00 --> 01:19:10,50
SOMEONE shoves SOMEONE off the dish. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS863
01:19:08,00 --> 01:19:14,50
The shaggy-haired boy plummets toward some trees. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS864
01:19:12,00 --> 01:19:19,50
Rings of sound waves shoot out of his mouth, expanding in a cone shape. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS865
01:19:16,00 --> 01:19:21,50
They propel SOMEONE high into the air. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS866
01:19:20,00 --> 01:19:29,50
The boy dives back toward the satellite dish, then uses his sound rings to glide over dish's concave face. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS867
01:19:26,00 --> 01:19:31,50
SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a disapproving look. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS868
01:19:32,00 --> 01:19:37,50
SOMEONE marks a mannequin with an X. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS869
01:19:39,00 --> 01:19:43,50
SOMEONE stands by the dummy. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS870
01:19:46,00 --> 01:19:52,50
On the mannequin's other side, SOMEONE inches away from the target. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS871
01:19:49,00 --> 01:19:57,50
SOMEONE shoots energy from his chest and the beam hits the dummy in a burst of flames. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS872
01:19:54,00 --> 01:20:00,50
Unharmed, SOMEONE and SOMEONE move aside. SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS873
01:20:02,00 --> 01:20:06,50
SOMEONE's grin fades. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS874
01:20:04,00 --> 01:20:10,50
Now SOMEONE points at the satellite dish in the far distance. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS875
01:20:08,00 --> 01:20:12,50
SOMEONE stare 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS876
01:20:11,00 --> 01:20:17,50
He shoots an uncertain look and his friend nod 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS877
01:20:14,00 --> 01:20:18,50
SOMEONE's shoulders heave. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS878
01:20:17,00 --> 01:20:23,50
With his fingers spread wide, he aims his palms at the dish. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS879
01:20:23,00 --> 01:20:27,50
It remains motionless. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS880
01:20:25,00 --> 01:20:31,50
SOMEONE's hands tremble and his face flushes. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS881
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:33,50
Lowering his arms, he drops his head. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS882
01:20:39,00 --> 01:20:44,50
Raising his fingers, he wiggles them questioningly. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS883
01:20:42,00 --> 01:20:48,50
SOMEONE shakes his head and SOMEONE touches his temple. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS884
01:20:45,00 --> 01:20:50,50
His eyes close briefly, then meet SOMEONE's. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS885
01:20:48,00 --> 01:20:53,50
The landscape around the brooding man blur 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS886
01:20:51,00 --> 01:20:57,50
In his mind's eye, SOMEONE sees a young SOMEONE lighting candle 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS887
01:20:55,00 --> 01:21:00,50
His mother stands with him and they share a smile. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS888
01:20:58,00 --> 01:21:03,50
Reaching out, she brushes his cheek with her finger. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS889
01:21:02,00 --> 01:21:07,50
As the memory fades, SOMEONE blinks out a tear. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS890
01:21:05,00 --> 01:21:10,50
He stares off, his chest heaving, then clenches his 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS892
01:21:09,00 --> 01:21:15,50
SOMEONE opens his eyes and brushes a tear from his own cheek. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS893
01:21:42,00 --> 01:21:46,50
He hold SOMEONE's gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS894
01:21:45,00 --> 01:21:49,50
He pats him on the shoulder. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS895
01:21:49,00 --> 01:21:54,50
SOMEONE faces the satellite dish. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS896
01:21:51,00 --> 01:21:59,50
He bows his head for a moment, then extends his hand and fingers as if stretching to reach the dish. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS897
01:22:00,00 --> 01:22:06,50
The dish shifts and SOMEONE knits his brow in concentration. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS898
01:22:04,00 --> 01:22:08,50
His hand trembles. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS899
01:22:10,00 --> 01:22:20,50
SOMEONE's shoulders heave as he controls the satellite dish, his face pulled into an expression of both sadness and triumph. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS900
01:22:18,00 --> 01:22:24,50
He curls his fingers as if holding an invisible tennis ball, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS901
01:22:21,00 --> 01:22:25,50
then turns his hand, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS902
01:22:22,00 --> 01:22:27,50
rotating the dish toward the mansion. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS903
01:22:25,00 --> 01:22:30,50
Breaking into a grin, he lowers his arm. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS904
01:22:28,00 --> 01:22:32,50
SOMEONE sticks her head out a window. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS905
01:22:34,00 --> 01:22:38,50
Now the group watches a TV. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS906
01:23:03,00 --> 01:23:10,50
Now as the Russian cargo ship glides over the ocean, SOMEONE's sub follows underwater. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS907
01:23:23,00 --> 01:23:28,50
SOMEONE watches the news. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS908
01:23:40,00 --> 01:23:48,50
Beside him, Angel twitches a smile, then clinks her glass with SOMEONE's.  

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS909
01:23:46,00 --> 01:23:50,50
Meanwhile in SOMEONE's room, SOMEONE enter. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS910
01:23:48,00 --> 01:23:52,50
SOMEONE beams at him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS911
01:23:51,00 --> 01:23:55,50
He holds out a case. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS912
01:23:52,00 --> 01:23:59,50
Grinning, SOMEONE opens it and finds two syringes with needles inside. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS913
01:23:56,00 --> 01:24:01,50
Her smile fades and she sits. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS914
01:23:58,00 --> 01:24:03,50
SOMEONE sits across from her. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS915
01:24:11,00 --> 01:24:17,50
SOMEONE stares with a conflicted gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS916
01:24:16,00 --> 01:24:20,50
She leans toward him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS917
01:24:32,00 --> 01:24:38,50
With a determined smile, he takes one of the shots from the case. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS918
01:24:36,00 --> 01:24:41,50
He taps the syringe's barrel, then prepares to inject. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS919
01:24:41,00 --> 01:24:45,50
He gives her a puzzled look. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS920
01:24:47,00 --> 01:24:52,50
SOMEONE's face falls and he glances away. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS921
01:24:54,00 --> 01:24:59,50
She stares into his eye 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS922
01:25:05,00 --> 01:25:09,50
Her eyes turn yellow. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS923
01:25:09,00 --> 01:25:16,50
Her skin becomes blue and her hair morphs into its original color. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS924
01:25:13,00 --> 01:25:17,50
SOMEONE gazes at her. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS925
01:25:28,00 --> 01:25:34,50
Changing back into the blonde teen, SOMEONE gives SOMEONE a heartbroken look. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS926
01:25:32,00 --> 01:25:35,50
He nods. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS927
01:25:34,00 --> 01:25:39,50
She averts her outraged gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS928
01:25:39,00 --> 01:25:46,50
Holding up the shot, he gives a firm nod, then stands and heads out of the room. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS929
01:25:44,00 --> 01:25:50,50
SOMEONE's betrayed eyes narrow as she watches him leave. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS930
01:25:48,00 --> 01:25:57,50
Lowering her gaze to the case, she removes its remaining injection, and stares at the lime-green serum in the syringe's barrel. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS931
01:25:56,00 --> 01:26:02,50
Now in a study, SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit across from each other, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS932
01:25:59,00 --> 01:26:04,50
their eyes fixed on a chess game between them. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS933
01:26:02,00 --> 01:26:08,50
SOMEONE rests his hand on his fist while SOMEONE sips a martini. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS934
01:26:17,00 --> 01:26:20,50
SOMEONE sits back. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS935
01:26:21,00 --> 01:26:27,50
SOMEONE lifts his gaze to his and frown 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS936
01:26:26,00 --> 01:26:31,50
SOMEONE captures one of his friend's chess pieces 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS937
01:26:29,00 --> 01:26:35,50
Leaning his elbows on his knees, SOMEONE folds his hand 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS938
01:27:08,00 --> 01:27:13,50
SOMEONE stares at the floor. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS939
01:27:13,00 --> 01:27:17,50
He looks at SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS940
01:27:21,00 --> 01:27:26,50
He holds the vengeful man's gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS941
01:27:31,00 --> 01:27:35,50
SOMEONE gives a cool look. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS942
01:27:37,00 --> 01:27:42,50
Now sitting in the lab, SOMEONE taps a syringe, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS943
01:27:40,00 --> 01:27:45,50
then holds his thumb over its plunger. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS944
01:27:42,00 --> 01:27:49,50
He glances over his shoulder, then looks at the finger-like toes of his right foot. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS945
01:27:47,00 --> 01:27:53,50
Steeling himself, the bespectacled young man takes a breath. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS946
01:27:51,00 --> 01:27:58,50
Bending down, he injects himself near the ankle and presses down on the plunger. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS947
01:27:56,00 --> 01:28:02,50
He removes the syringe and sits up, keeping his eyes fixed on his foot. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS948
01:28:02,00 --> 01:28:06,50
The mutated appendage shrinks, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS949
01:28:04,00 --> 01:28:09,50
forming the shape of an average human foot. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS950
01:28:06,00 --> 01:28:11,50
SOMEONE wiggles his normal-looking toes. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS951
01:28:09,00 --> 01:28:15,50
Studying his new foot, the young man smiles, teary-eyed. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS952
01:28:14,00 --> 01:28:20,50
He glances aside, then looks at his right foot again. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS953
01:28:18,00 --> 01:28:23,50
The knuckles expand and the toes elongate. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS954
01:28:22,00 --> 01:28:26,50
SOMEONE shakes his head. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS955
01:28:24,00 --> 01:28:32,50
As the foot grows long and wide, things protrude from under the skin, which turns blue. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS956
01:28:30,00 --> 01:28:35,50
Clutching his leg, SOMEONE grits his teeth. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS957
01:28:32,00 --> 01:28:37,50
Things protrude on his mutating hands as well. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS958
01:28:35,00 --> 01:28:42,50
As he clutches at his pant leg, it rises, revealing a thick coat of blue hair. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS959
01:28:39,00 --> 01:28:45,50
His hand balloons in size and lands on a lamp table. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS960
01:28:42,00 --> 01:28:48,50
Growing blue and furry, the giant arm topples the table. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS961
01:28:46,00 --> 01:28:53,50
Reflected in a glass sphere, SOMEONE's human face morphs into that of a monster. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS962
01:28:50,00 --> 01:28:56,50
Now SOMEONE steps through a door and stops with a slight smile. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS964
01:28:55,00 --> 01:29:00,50
He shuts the door behind him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS966
01:29:00,00 --> 01:29:05,50
SOMEONE lies in his bed. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS970
01:29:08,00 --> 01:29:14,50
He crosses the room. SOMEONE turns on her side and shape-shifts. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS971
01:29:13,00 --> 01:29:21,50
SOMEONE faces a sultry woman, slightly older, with wavy blonde hair. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS973
01:29:21,00 --> 01:29:26,50
She returns to her regular human form. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS975
01:29:28,00 --> 01:29:37,50
Starting at her hand, she shifts into her natural form, with scaly blue skin, slick dark-red hair, and pale-yellow eye 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS977
01:29:48,00 --> 01:29:53,50
SOMEONE sits beside her on the bed. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS983
01:30:09,00 --> 01:30:16,50
He leans in and kisses her on the lips, then gently raises his hand to her neck. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS984
01:30:14,00 --> 01:30:20,50
Now SOMEONE's blue feet step onto a shag carpet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS989
01:30:25,00 --> 01:30:31,50
Our view rises up the side of her naked body, revealing the hard rippled blue skin on her thigh, her forearm, and the side of her breast. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS993
01:30:35,00 --> 01:30:40,50
She faces SOMEONE, who takes a bottle out of a refrigerator. He faces her, slack-jawed. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS997
01:30:44,00 --> 01:30:51,50
She sits at a table. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1009
01:31:17,00 --> 01:31:21,50
She leaves the table. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1010
01:31:19,00 --> 01:31:24,50
SOMEONE watches her go, then lowers his gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1012
01:31:23,00 --> 01:31:28,50
A note on one of the mansion's inner doors reads, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1013
01:31:25,00 --> 01:31:31,50
"Gone to the airbase. Bring the crate marked 'X'." 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1014
01:31:29,00 --> 01:31:34,50
SOMEONE pulls it down and enters the lab. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1015
01:31:32,00 --> 01:31:37,50
SOMEONE and the other mutants follow him inside. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1016
01:31:35,00 --> 01:31:40,50
SOMEONE steps past toppled workstations. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1017
01:31:39,00 --> 01:31:52,50
SOMEONE glances back. SOMEONE looks on, wearing clothes but in her natural form. SOMEONE opens a crate marked "X." The whole team peers inside. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1019
01:31:59,00 --> 01:32:04,50
SOMEONE shuts the lid, darkening our view. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1020
01:32:01,00 --> 01:32:07,50
Now a hangar stands across an airfield. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1021
01:32:04,00 --> 01:32:11,50
Inside, our view drifts down past the nose of a massive jet 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1022
01:32:08,00 --> 01:32:14,50
and finds the five mutants staring up at the shuttle. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1023
01:32:11,00 --> 01:32:21,50
Each wearing form-fitting blue-and-yellow jumpsuits, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and Mystique stand side by side. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1024
01:32:25,00 --> 01:32:30,50
They share concerned looks. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1025
01:32:29,00 --> 01:32:35,50
A broad-shouldered figure with thick forearms approaches. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1026
01:32:32,00 --> 01:32:39,50
As he nears the group, SOMEONE lowers his gaze and SOMEONE and SOMEONE trade a look. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1027
01:32:39,00 --> 01:32:48,50
The bespectacled mutant steps out of the shadows to reveal his pale-blue face framed by a coat of blue fur. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1028
01:33:01,00 --> 01:33:06,50
She touches his cheek. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1029
01:33:05,00 --> 01:33:09,50
He nods. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1030
01:33:07,00 --> 01:33:12,50
SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE's throat and snarls. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1032
01:33:17,00 --> 01:33:21,50
SOMEONE drops SOMEONE to the floor. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1033
01:33:33,00 --> 01:33:39,50
Now as the Aral Sea leaves a wide wake, a word appears: 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1035
01:33:37,00 --> 01:33:44,50
On either side of the cargo ship, the opposing fleets face each other. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1036
01:33:41,00 --> 01:33:47,50
The crafts become blips on a US battleship's radar screen. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1037
01:33:50,00 --> 01:33:55,50
An admiral peers through binoculars. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1038
01:33:57,00 --> 01:34:03,50
The admiral grimly lowers his binocular 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1039
01:34:07,00 --> 01:34:14,50
The officers take off their hats and put on helmets and life vests. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1040
01:34:12,00 --> 01:34:22,50
Meanwhile on a Russian battleship, the captain lowers a pair of binoculars, then crosses to a radioman, who shakes his head. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1041
01:34:19,00 --> 01:34:23,50
An officer faces him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1044
01:34:33,00 --> 01:34:37,50
The captain looks over the bridge 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1046
01:34:39,00 --> 01:34:44,50
Battle stations. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1048
01:34:48,00 --> 01:34:53,50
On the US-naval bridge, two triple-barreled cannons take aim. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1049
01:34:51,00 --> 01:34:56,50
Fleet reports all weapons ready. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1050
01:34:54,00 --> 01:35:00,50
The radioman speaks up. From the Kremlin sir, new orders. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1051
01:34:58,00 --> 01:35:07,50
As of 10:25 hours, the cargo vessel Aral Sea is hereby ordered to reverse course and return to port in Odessa. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1052
01:35:04,00 --> 01:35:09,50
Aral Sea, come in. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1054
01:35:07,00 --> 01:35:12,50
The captain watches the cargo ship. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1055
01:35:09,00 --> 01:35:19,50
They are not responding. She's not turning around. Aral Sea, you are ordered to turn around. Do not cross the line. On the US bridge. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1056
01:35:21,00 --> 01:35:31,50
the admiral peers through his binoculars. Above, the mutants' sleek jet arrives. It soars low over the American fleet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1057
01:35:28,00 --> 01:35:35,50
The admiral and his men watch the unique aircraft pass by. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1058
01:35:32,00 --> 01:35:37,50
In the cockpit, Beast eyes the ships. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1059
01:35:35,00 --> 01:35:40,50
The others ride in the cabin. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1060
01:35:37,00 --> 01:35:45,50
SOMEONE shifts his gaze. SOMEONE touches his finger to his temple and closes his eye 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1061
01:35:42,00 --> 01:35:47,50
He envisions the cargo ship. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1062
01:35:44,00 --> 01:35:49,50
Inside, a crew member lies on the floor. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1063
01:35:46,00 --> 01:35:51,50
SOMEONE kicks him. In the jet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1064
01:36:03,00 --> 01:36:09,50
The jet soars over the opposing fleets. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1065
01:36:27,00 --> 01:36:33,50
SOMEONE touches his temple and closes his eyes. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1066
01:36:30,00 --> 01:36:36,50
On the Russian ship, an officer suddenly lifts his head. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1067
01:36:34,00 --> 01:36:42,50
With wide eyes, he crosses the bridge, pushes a fellow officer out of his way, and presses a button. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1068
01:36:39,00 --> 01:36:44,50
A rocket launches from the ship. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1069
01:36:41,00 --> 01:36:47,50
The admiral looks on from the USS Independence. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1070
01:36:44,00 --> 01:36:49,50
Beast notices the rocket heading their way. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1071
01:36:47,00 --> 01:36:52,50
The jet barrel rolls for it to pass over. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1072
01:36:49,00 --> 01:36:56,50
The cabin turns upside-down, startling the mutants on board. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1073
01:36:53,00 --> 01:37:05,50
In the cockpit, Beast bares his fangs. The passengers brace themselves. As the rocket heads for the cargo ship, SOMEONE notices and disappear 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1074
01:37:03,00 --> 01:37:10,50
The ship erupts in a fiery blaze. On the submarine. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1075
01:37:10,00 --> 01:37:14,50
On the jet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1076
01:37:15,00 --> 01:37:19,50
On the USS Independence. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1077
01:37:20,00 --> 01:37:26,50
On the Russian ship, the captain faces the possessed officer. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1082
01:37:37,00 --> 01:37:41,50
Now on the submarine. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1083
01:37:42,00 --> 01:37:47,50
SOMEONE sits in a leather chair. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1084
01:37:47,00 --> 01:37:52,50
He glances at his cohorts. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1085
01:37:51,00 --> 01:37:56,50
He puts on his helmet. Now in the jet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1086
01:38:10,00 --> 01:38:14,50
SOMEONE's nostrils flare. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1088
01:38:15,00 --> 01:38:22,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE take of their headsets. Beast grins. Now in the submarine. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1089
01:38:34,00 --> 01:38:39,50
SOMEONE steps through a doorway. In the jet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1091
01:38:39,00 --> 01:38:45,50
Beast works the controls and the jet steadies itself. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1092
01:38:42,00 --> 01:38:46,50
SOMEONE approaches SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1093
01:38:47,00 --> 01:38:51,50
SOMEONE show his hands. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1094
01:38:50,00 --> 01:38:56,50
Trapdoors swing open, giving the mutants a view of the passing sea below. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1095
01:38:54,00 --> 01:38:59,50
SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE. SOMEONE looks on. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1096
01:39:13,00 --> 01:39:22,50
SOMEONE jumps out of the jet, opens the winged arms of his suit, then soars off his sound waves high into the air. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1097
01:39:19,00 --> 01:39:26,50
The young man brings his arms in at his sides and shoots head first into the sea. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1098
01:39:25,00 --> 01:39:30,50
Under water, he peers through the murky deep. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1099
01:39:27,00 --> 01:39:31,50
In the jet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1100
01:39:31,00 --> 01:39:38,50
SOMEONE screams and a sound wave shoots across the ocean floor to the submarine. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1101
01:39:36,00 --> 01:39:45,50
SOMEONE's dark-haired cohort grabs his headphones. SOMEONE turns. A sound wave travels back to the mutant. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1102
01:39:42,00 --> 01:39:46,50
SOMEONE touches his temple. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1103
01:39:46,00 --> 01:39:51,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE face each other. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1104
01:39:53,00 --> 01:39:58,50
The jet banks right, heading for the fleet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1105
01:39:55,00 --> 01:40:02,50
Now in the mirrored chamber, a doorway opens revealing SOMEONE's office. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1106
01:39:59,00 --> 01:40:05,50
The SOMEONE enters and as the passage closes behind him, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1107
01:40:02,00 --> 01:40:08,50
it blends in seamlessly with the rest of the wall. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1108
01:40:05,00 --> 01:40:11,50
The waist-high pillar rises from the blue-lit floor. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1109
01:40:08,00 --> 01:40:13,50
holding several glowing rods. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1110
01:40:10,00 --> 01:40:17,50
SOMEONE flips three switches, then grips a lever and slides it upward. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1111
01:40:14,00 --> 01:40:24,50
Two rods rise from the pillar and SOMEONE clutches them with both hands. Subtle waves of energy pulsate through the SOMEONE's body. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1112
01:40:21,00 --> 01:40:28,50
The needle on a meter indicating reactor-energy state falls. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1113
01:40:25,00 --> 01:40:30,50
Now hovering over the sea, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1114
01:40:27,00 --> 01:40:32,50
the jet's landing gear lowers. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1115
01:40:29,00 --> 01:40:35,50
Perched on one of the wheels, SOMEONE scans the ocean below. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1116
01:40:32,00 --> 01:40:37,50
He holds out his hand. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1117
01:40:36,00 --> 01:40:42,50
The admiral peers through his binoculars, watching the hovering jet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1118
01:40:40,00 --> 01:40:45,50
SOMEONE keeps his palm turned down to the sea. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1119
01:40:43,00 --> 01:40:49,50
Peeking through an opening above, SOMEONE notices a change in his partner. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1120
01:40:47,00 --> 01:40:51,50
SOMEONE tightens his jaw. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1121
01:40:48,00 --> 01:40:52,50
His hand trembles. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1122
01:40:51,00 --> 01:40:57,50
Straining, he grimaces. SOMEONE touches his temple. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1123
01:41:00,00 --> 01:41:06,50
A calm overtakes SOMEONE's face. He grits his teeth. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1124
01:41:04,00 --> 01:41:10,50
Beyond the outstretched fingers of his trembling hand, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1125
01:41:07,00 --> 01:41:12,50
the submarine rises from the deep. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1126
01:41:09,00 --> 01:41:15,50
The submarine's spinning propellers emerge from the water, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1127
01:41:12,00 --> 01:41:17,50
followed by four tail fins. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1128
01:41:14,00 --> 01:41:20,50
As the propellers rise, sea water rains down. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1129
01:41:17,00 --> 01:41:23,50
SOMEONE shakes from the strain of lifting the vessel. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1130
01:41:20,00 --> 01:41:27,50
The entire craft leaves the sea and rises into the air alongside of the jet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1131
01:41:25,00 --> 01:41:31,50
In the cockpit, Beast notices the submarine on his left. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1132
01:41:29,00 --> 01:41:35,50
Through his binoculars, the admiral watches the vessel rise. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1133
01:41:33,00 --> 01:41:38,50
He lowers the lenses, his jaw slack. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1134
01:41:36,00 --> 01:41:41,50
An American radioman lowers his headset. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1135
01:41:39,00 --> 01:41:46,50
The submarine floats past the Russian ship, where several sailors watch from the deck. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1136
01:41:44,00 --> 01:41:48,50
The captain looks on. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1137
01:41:45,00 --> 01:41:52,50
In the cockpit, Beast pushes a lever, firing the jet's twin engines. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1138
01:41:49,00 --> 01:41:55,50
SOMEONE holds his position on the landing gear. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1139
01:41:52,00 --> 01:42:00,50
While the jet and the submarine fly side by side, en route to a shoreline miles ahead. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1140
01:42:02,00 --> 01:42:10,50
On board the Independence, the admiral and his men peer through windows encasing the bridge. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1141
01:42:07,00 --> 01:42:16,50
A hatch on top of the sub opens and SOMEONE's dark-haired cohort climbs out wearing a tailored purple suit. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1142
01:42:13,00 --> 01:42:25,50
SOMEONE peers at the SOMEONE, who twirls, engulfing himself in a cyclone, which grows tremendously in size and crosses onto the surface of the sea. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1143
01:42:22,00 --> 01:42:27,50
SOMEONE holds his focused gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1144
01:42:25,00 --> 01:42:30,50
Beast eyes the twister. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1145
01:42:30,00 --> 01:42:35,50
The cyclone swallows the jet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1146
01:42:32,00 --> 01:42:37,50
On board, SOMEONE and SOMEONE brace themselves. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1147
01:42:35,00 --> 01:42:43,50
SOMEONE loses control and the submarine drops to the edge of the sandy shore, landing on its side. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1148
01:42:40,00 --> 01:42:45,50
SOMEONE clings to the landing gear. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1149
01:42:48,00 --> 01:42:57,50
Tumbling across the beach, the submarine mows down several palm trees, creating a cloud of sand. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1150
01:42:54,00 --> 01:43:00,50
As it comes to a stop, sand blots out our view. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1151
01:42:58,00 --> 01:43:04,50
A wing breaks from the aircraft igniting a fiery blaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1152
01:43:01,00 --> 01:43:07,50
SOMEONE eyes the cockpit, where Beast works the controls. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1153
01:43:04,00 --> 01:43:09,50
SOMEONE dangles from the jet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1154
01:43:06,00 --> 01:43:11,50
SOMEONE pulls him into the cabin. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1155
01:43:08,00 --> 01:43:13,50
The jet crash lands on the beach. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1156
01:43:10,00 --> 01:43:19,50
SOMEONE hits the floor and SOMEONE covers him, securing them both to the metal hull as the jet rolls upside-down. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1157
01:43:17,00 --> 01:43:22,50
The aircraft tumbles to a stop and lies belly up. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1158
01:43:20,00 --> 01:43:26,50
Inside, SOMEONE levitates down with SOMEONE on his chest. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1159
01:43:26,00 --> 01:43:33,50
A cloud of black smoke rises from the jet's burning wreckage. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1160
01:43:31,00 --> 01:43:36,50
The beached submarine lies nearby. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1161
01:43:33,00 --> 01:43:38,50
SOMEONE crosses the cabin. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1162
01:43:40,00 --> 01:43:45,50
SOMEONE frees SOMEONE from her chair. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1163
01:43:43,00 --> 01:43:48,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE look outside. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1164
01:44:16,00 --> 01:44:23,50
Beast, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE step outside and spot SOMEONE's cohorts by the submarine. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1165
01:44:20,00 --> 01:44:27,50
As Angel takes flight, the dark-haired mutant forms a cyclone in each hand. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1166
01:44:24,00 --> 01:44:30,50
SOMEONE blasts him against the submarine. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1167
01:44:27,00 --> 01:44:33,50
As SOMEONE attacks Beast, his tail grabs SOMEONE's throat. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1168
01:44:30,00 --> 01:44:36,50
They all reappear in the sky. SOMEONE falls. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1169
01:44:34,00 --> 01:44:40,50
Beast grabs SOMEONE's arm with his foot, then clutches SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1170
01:44:39,00 --> 01:44:44,50
They disappear, then land safely on a ship. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1171
01:44:45,00 --> 01:44:53,50
With a flick of his hand, SOMEONE rips off a chunk of the sub, crushing the cyclone-maker. He runs on board. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1173
01:44:56,00 --> 01:45:03,50
On the ship's deck, SOMEONE dodges SOMEONE's blast and strangles him with his tail. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1174
01:45:01,00 --> 01:45:06,50
Beast tackles SOMEONE and they disappear. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1175
01:45:03,00 --> 01:45:08,50
Armed sailors surround SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1176
01:45:07,00 --> 01:45:15,50
The admiral and his men peer down from the bridge. SOMEONE crosses the submarine and reaches a control panel. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1177
01:45:17,00 --> 01:45:21,50
SOMEONE lowers the lever. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1178
01:45:19,00 --> 01:45:26,50
SOMEONE lets go of the glowing rods and his doubled form gradually reverts to normal. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1179
01:45:24,00 --> 01:45:30,50
He shifts his troubled gaze. On the ship's deck. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1180
01:45:31,00 --> 01:45:37,50
SOMEONE stands up and faces the sailors with his hands up. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1181
01:45:34,00 --> 01:45:40,50
He spots Angel fluttering above the ship. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1183
01:45:40,00 --> 01:45:48,50
She spits fireballs, knocking him off of his feet, and scorching the disc on his chest. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1184
01:45:45,00 --> 01:45:50,50
He removes the burning disc, then looks up. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1185
01:45:47,00 --> 01:45:53,50
Flapping her wings, Angel scans the deck. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1186
01:45:51,00 --> 01:45:59,50
SOMEONE flies up from the water and sends Angel tumbling off course with a sonic scream. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1187
01:45:56,00 --> 01:46:03,50
She regains her balance, then chases the young mutant across the sky. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1188
01:46:00,00 --> 01:46:06,50
In the submarine, SOMEONE crosses the office. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1189
01:46:15,00 --> 01:46:21,50
Behind him, the wall parts, revealing the secret chamber. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1190
01:46:24,00 --> 01:46:29,50
SOMEONE cautiously approaches the doorway. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1191
01:46:28,00 --> 01:46:34,50
Meanwhile, Angel chases SOMEONE past a battleship. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1192
01:46:31,00 --> 01:46:38,50
Staying on his tail, she spits several fireballs, strafing the sea. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1193
01:46:36,00 --> 01:46:42,50
SOMEONE corkscrews over a ship, then glides down near the water. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1194
01:46:39,00 --> 01:46:44,50
The American officer looks on. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1195
01:46:41,00 --> 01:46:47,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE steps into the mirrored chamber. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1196
01:47:00,00 --> 01:47:07,50
SOMEONE punches SOMEONE in the face, which multiplies momentarily. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1197
01:47:04,00 --> 01:47:10,50
The SOMEONE stands upright, unharmed, and SOMEONE gapes. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1198
01:47:08,00 --> 01:47:15,50
On the deck, SOMEONE spots SOMEONE flying his way and covers his ears. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1199
01:47:12,00 --> 01:47:18,50
The young mutant screams and the sailors fall to their knees. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1200
01:47:16,00 --> 01:47:22,50
SOMEONE sprints across the deck, leaps, and grabs onto SOMEONE's hand. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1201
01:47:19,00 --> 01:47:25,50
The young mutant carries his friend over the water. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1202
01:47:22,00 --> 01:47:27,50
Angel chases after them. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1203
01:47:24,00 --> 01:47:30,50
Dangling underneath SOMEONE, SOMEONE eyes a ship below. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1204
01:47:27,00 --> 01:47:34,50
Angel spits a fireball, which tears through one of SOMEONE's fabric wings. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1205
01:47:32,00 --> 01:47:39,50
Losing control, the young mutant descends, dipping SOMEONE's toes into the water. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1206
01:47:36,00 --> 01:47:43,50
Reaching the shoreline, the two mutants crash land and tumble across the beach. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1207
01:47:40,00 --> 01:47:44,50
In the chamber. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1208
01:47:49,00 --> 01:47:56,50
He touches SOMEONE's forehead, sending the mutant crashing into a mirror. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1209
01:47:53,00 --> 01:48:00,50
Our view shoots through the cracked glass and across the beach to SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1210
01:48:03,00 --> 01:48:07,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1211
01:48:11,00 --> 01:48:18,50
The SOMEONE flings SOMEONE across the room, shattering another mirror. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1212
01:48:18,00 --> 01:48:23,50
Angel flutters over the sea. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1213
01:48:20,00 --> 01:48:25,50
SOMEONE kneels at SOMEONE's side. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1214
01:48:23,00 --> 01:48:29,50
As the villainess approaches, SOMEONE hurls an energy disc past her. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1215
01:48:26,00 --> 01:48:32,50
Flailing wildly, Angel falls to the sand. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1216
01:48:30,00 --> 01:48:36,50
SOMEONE sighs and SOMEONE laughs. In the chamber. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1217
01:48:37,00 --> 01:48:44,50
SOMEONE rises from the floor and sends metal beams crashing through the chamber between them. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1218
01:48:52,00 --> 01:49:00,50
SOMEONE touches a girder SOMEONE holds between them. He calmly backs the mutant against a wall. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1219
01:48:58,00 --> 01:49:06,50
On the deck, Beast throws SOMEONE over a railing, but the devilish mutant teleports and tackles him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1220
01:49:03,00 --> 01:49:09,50
They both disappear, then land on the beach. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1221
01:49:06,00 --> 01:49:14,50
As the point of SOMEONE's tail nears Beast's left eye, SOMEONE steps out of the sub. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1222
01:49:14,00 --> 01:49:27,50
SOMEONE rises from Beast and faces his leader. SOMEONE holds his gaze. Beast throws SOMEONE, then strikes his chest, dropping him face down on the sand. He looks at SOMEONE, who shifts into Mystique. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1223
01:49:25,00 --> 01:49:29,50
In the reactor chamber. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1224
01:50:03,00 --> 01:50:10,50
Pressed against the wall, SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE, who grins, baring only his top teeth. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1225
01:50:11,00 --> 01:50:16,50
A cable snatches the helmet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1226
01:50:14,00 --> 01:50:17,50
SOMEONE freezes. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1227
01:50:19,00 --> 01:50:26,50
The girder trapping SOMEONE falls and he steps around the SOMEONE to face him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1228
01:50:23,00 --> 01:50:30,50
SOMEONE stands frozen, arm outstretched, reaching for his helmet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1229
01:50:28,00 --> 01:50:34,50
The helmet descends into SOMEONE's hands. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1230
01:50:39,00 --> 01:50:43,50
SOMEONE puts on the helmet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1231
01:50:44,00 --> 01:50:50,50
He takes two steps toward SOMEONE and tilts his head 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1232
01:50:47,00 --> 01:50:52,50
Gazing into the villains eye 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1233
01:51:04,00 --> 01:51:08,50
He walks away. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1234
01:51:09,00 --> 01:51:21,50
Across the room from SOMEONE, SOMEONE holds up the Nazi coin, aligning it to the SOMEONE's frozen gaze. Sharp focus switches from the coin's swastika to SOMEONE's plain expression. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1235
01:51:26,00 --> 01:51:31,50
The coin floats from his hand. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1236
01:51:29,00 --> 01:51:34,50
SOMEONE keeps a finger to his temple. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1237
01:51:33,00 --> 01:51:38,50
The coin drifts toward SOMEONE's frozen form. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1238
01:51:35,00 --> 01:51:41,50
In the X-Jet, SOMEONE breathes strenuously. Concentrating. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1239
01:51:39,00 --> 01:51:44,50
SOMEONE looks on behind him. Back in the sub. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1240
01:51:42,00 --> 01:51:47,50
The coin approaches SOMEONE's forehead. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1241
01:51:44,00 --> 01:51:51,50
As SOMEONE expels strained breaths, SOMEONE stays focused on SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1242
01:51:50,00 --> 01:51:55,50
The coin pierces SOMEONE's forehead. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1243
01:51:53,00 --> 01:51:59,50
SOMEONE screams as the coin disappears into SOMEONE's skull. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1244
01:51:57,00 --> 01:52:05,50
A side-on view that tracks the coin's path switches between SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1245
01:52:02,00 --> 01:52:11,50
Now the coin emerges from the back of the SOMEONE's head and falls to the floor, splotched with the SOMEONE's blood. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1246
01:52:12,00 --> 01:52:23,50
Framed by the metal helmet, SOMEONE's parted lips and glistening eyes show his gaze to be strangely tense and tranquil. In the war room. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1247
01:52:37,00 --> 01:52:43,50
On the beach, SOMEONE and SOMEONE step outside. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1248
01:52:40,00 --> 01:52:45,50
SOMEONE's body levitates out of the submarine. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1249
01:52:45,00 --> 01:52:52,50
As the mutants gather around, SOMEONE's body floats above, arms outstretched. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1250
01:52:50,00 --> 01:52:55,50
Blood leaks from the wound on his forehead. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1251
01:52:52,00 --> 01:52:59,50
SOMEONE lets him drop onto the sand. The mutants look on. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1252
01:52:56,00 --> 01:53:03,50
SOMEONE, Angel, and their dark-haired cohort approach SOMEONE's body. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1253
01:53:00,00 --> 01:53:08,50
With open arms, SOMEONE levitates down from a blast hole near the top of the submarine. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1254
01:53:05,00 --> 01:53:11,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE step forward as he lands on the beach. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1255
01:53:14,00 --> 01:53:19,50
SOMEONE points to the battleships. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1256
01:53:33,00 --> 01:53:38,50
SOMEONE parallels SOMEONE's strides. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1257
01:53:37,00 --> 01:53:41,50
He touches his temple. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1258
01:53:41,00 --> 01:53:47,50
Crossing the beach, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE all face the distant fleet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1259
01:53:47,00 --> 01:53:52,50
The triple-barreled cannons aim at the shore. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1260
01:53:49,00 --> 01:53:55,50
SOMEONE lowers his fingertips from his temple, breathing heavily. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1261
01:53:53,00 --> 01:54:00,50
He looks at SOMEONE and nods. She runs to the crashed X-Jet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1262
01:53:57,00 --> 01:54:02,50
Onboard, she radios the American ship. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1263
01:54:15,00 --> 01:54:21,50
New orders: fire on the beach. The Russian Captain holds. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1264
01:54:22,00 --> 01:54:28,50
SOMEONE lowers a headset from her ear, her mouth agape. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1265
01:54:25,00 --> 01:54:30,50
On the beach, SOMEONE shifts his gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1266
01:54:27,00 --> 01:54:32,50
The American commander peers sternly. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1267
01:54:31,00 --> 01:54:35,50
The Russian Captain seconds. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1269
01:54:34,00 --> 01:54:39,50
Heavy artillery fires from both fleets. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1270
01:54:36,00 --> 01:54:41,50
The mutants watch from the shore. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1271
01:54:38,00 --> 01:54:43,50
Dozens of missiles race toward the Cuban coast 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1272
01:54:41,00 --> 01:54:46,50
streaking the sky with lines of smoke. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1273
01:54:43,00 --> 01:54:52,50
The mutants hold their positions. Our view follows the rockets. SOMEONE eyes them, his mouth slightly agape. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1274
01:54:50,00 --> 01:55:00,50
With the mutants behind him, SOMEONE raises a hand and the rockets stop in mid-air within a 100 feet of the shore. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1275
01:54:57,00 --> 01:55:03,50
He peers at them, his eyes framed by the helmet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1276
01:55:00,00 --> 01:55:06,50
All of the missiles remain suspended in the sky. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1277
01:55:04,00 --> 01:55:09,50
Through his binoculars, the admiral spots them. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1278
01:55:06,00 --> 01:55:11,50
His men gather behind. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1279
01:55:08,00 --> 01:55:13,50
The Russian captain watches from his ship. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1280
01:55:10,00 --> 01:55:18,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE stand before the hovering missiles. As SOMEONE slowly twists his left hand, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1281
01:55:15,00 --> 01:55:21,50
the rockets rotate to face their points of origin. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1282
01:55:26,00 --> 01:55:31,50
The rockets complete their rotation. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1283
01:55:42,00 --> 01:55:46,50
SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1284
01:55:46,00 --> 01:55:52,50
SOMEONE thrusts his open hand and the missiles head for the ships. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1285
01:55:52,00 --> 01:56:00,50
SOMEONE holds his merciless gaze. The rockets soar toward the American and Russian fleets. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1286
01:56:00,00 --> 01:56:06,50
SOMEONE tackles SOMEONE. The rockets fall from the sky, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1287
01:56:03,00 --> 01:56:09,50
a few exploding. SOMEONE reaches for SOMEONE's helmet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1288
01:56:09,00 --> 01:56:16,50
SOMEONE elbows him and sends the other mutants flying across the beach. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1289
01:56:13,00 --> 01:56:23,50
As he holds SOMEONE down, he regains control of the missiles. The American and Russian commanders each watch them returning. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1290
01:56:22,00 --> 01:56:30,50
As SOMEONE punches SOMEONE in the face, a few more rockets explode. The remainder skew chaotically. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1291
01:56:27,00 --> 01:56:35,50
SOMEONE holds out his hand again, cuing the rockets back on course toward the ships. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1292
01:56:35,00 --> 01:56:40,50
Comrades, thank you for your service. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1293
01:56:38,00 --> 01:56:49,50
The rockets hone in on the ships. As the American admiral and Russian captain observe resignedly, SOMEONE fires a bullet at SOMEONE's helmet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1294
01:56:46,00 --> 01:56:57,50
The shot ricochets, distracting him, and the rockets fall. SOMEONE deflects each bullet fired by her and one strikes SOMEONE in the back. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1295
01:56:54,00 --> 01:57:03,50
As the telepath collapses, a stunned SOMEONE lowers her pistol and SOMEONE sadly sees his friend fall. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1296
01:57:00,00 --> 01:57:06,50
The wounded mutant hits the sand, belly down. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1297
01:57:03,00 --> 01:57:08,50
SOMEONE covers her mouth. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1298
01:57:05,00 --> 01:57:11,50
SOMEONE hurries to SOMEONE and holds a hand over the wound. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1299
01:57:09,00 --> 01:57:16,50
SOMEONE grimaces as SOMEONE extracts the bullet, which rolls into his palm. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1300
01:57:13,00 --> 01:57:20,50
Over the sea, the rockets fall from the sky, some bursting in mid-air, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1301
01:57:18,00 --> 01:57:22,50
others landing in the water. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1302
01:57:19,00 --> 01:57:27,50
In slow motion, both the Russians and Americans celebrate. SOMEONE runs over to SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1303
01:57:27,00 --> 01:57:32,50
The others halt. SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1304
01:57:32,00 --> 01:57:39,50
He strangles her with her own dog tags. Gripping the chain, she steps backward. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1305
01:57:45,00 --> 01:57:50,50
SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE, who lies in his arms. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1306
01:57:47,00 --> 01:57:53,50
He lowers his hand and SOMEONE drops to her knee 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1307
01:58:21,00 --> 01:58:27,50
As they hold eye contact, SOMEONE mournfully tightens his jaw. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1308
01:58:28,00 --> 01:58:33,50
SOMEONE holds his tender gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1310
01:58:32,00 --> 01:58:38,50
he looks at SOMEONE and curtly beckons her to approach. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1311
01:58:41,00 --> 01:58:48,50
As SOMEONE kneels over SOMEONE, SOMEONE addresses the other mutant 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1312
01:59:02,00 --> 01:59:08,50
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, Beast and SOMEONE look on as one group. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1313
01:59:05,00 --> 01:59:11,50
Angel, SOMEONE, and the cyclone master stand in another. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1314
01:59:09,00 --> 01:59:15,50
SOMEONE peers in SOMEONE's direction, then reaches out to her. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1315
01:59:15,00 --> 01:59:21,50
She limps forward, leaving Beast and the others behind. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1316
01:59:22,00 --> 01:59:30,50
As SOMEONE crosses the beach, she glances at SOMEONE and SOMEONE, then sets her gaze on SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1317
01:59:30,00 --> 01:59:35,50
She looks to SOMEONE again. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1318
01:59:35,00 --> 01:59:40,50
SOMEONE kneels down beside SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1319
01:59:38,00 --> 01:59:42,50
SOMEONE observes. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1320
01:59:55,00 --> 02:00:00,50
He kisses the back of her hand. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1321
01:59:58,00 --> 02:00:03,50
She kisses his forehead, then looks to SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1322
02:00:02,00 --> 02:00:07,50
SOMEONE rises and takes SOMEONE's hand. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1323
02:00:05,00 --> 02:00:10,50
While SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and Beast stay put across the beach 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1324
02:00:08,00 --> 02:00:14,50
SOMEONE, Angel, and the cyclone master join SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1325
02:00:12,00 --> 02:00:17,50
They stand in a line, all holding hand 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1326
02:00:24,00 --> 02:00:29,50
Beast averts his gaze. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1327
02:00:26,00 --> 02:00:33,50
In a series of fiery poofs, beginning with SOMEONE and ending with SOMEONE 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1328
02:00:31,00 --> 02:00:35,50
SOMEONE's faction disappear 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1329
02:00:33,00 --> 02:00:38,50
The remaining mutants rush to SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1330
02:00:57,00 --> 02:01:02,50
As a bird's-eye view withdraws from the group, 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1331
02:00:59,00 --> 02:01:04,50
the sprawling shore soon dwarfs them. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1332
02:01:02,00 --> 02:01:08,50
Smoke rises from the crashed submarine and X-Jet. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1333
02:01:06,00 --> 02:01:11,50
Black-and-white footage of SOMEONE F. Kennedy appear 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1334
02:01:26,00 --> 02:01:31,50
Now outside SOMEONE's mansion. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1335
02:01:38,00 --> 02:01:44,50
SOMEONE pushes his wheelchair, then stops and faces him. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1336
02:02:20,00 --> 02:02:26,50
She leans down, meeting his gaze squarely. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1337
02:02:36,00 --> 02:02:42,50
He kisses her lips, then raises his fingers to his temple. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1338
02:02:40,00 --> 02:02:44,50
Fade to white. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1339
02:02:41,00 --> 02:02:47,50
In a conference room, SOMEONE addresses a dozen suits. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1340
02:03:20,00 --> 02:03:27,50
The room shakes and everyone stands. One man grabs a phone. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1341
02:03:25,00 --> 02:03:32,50
As SOMEONE peers out a window, our view descends to SOMEONE's cell. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1342
02:03:29,00 --> 02:03:36,50
Clad in white, the blonde mutant rises from her bed and faces a metal door. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1343
02:03:34,00 --> 02:03:40,50
The door rips open and SOMEONE shifts into her diamond form. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1344
02:03:38,00 --> 02:03:42,50
SOMEONE ambles into the cell. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1345
02:03:44,00 --> 02:03:49,50
He wears a red helmet and black cape. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1346
02:03:57,00 --> 02:04:02,50
SOMEONE looks to his right, as does SOMEONE. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1347
02:03:59,00 --> 02:04:05,50
His four cohorts stand in the doorway. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1348
02:04:04,00 --> 02:04:11,50
SOMEONE returns her gaze to her initial visitor, then changes back to her human form. 

XMEN_FIRST_CLASS_DVS1349
02:04:12,00 --> 02:04:19,50
Our view roves in close to his face framed by the gladiator-like helmet.
