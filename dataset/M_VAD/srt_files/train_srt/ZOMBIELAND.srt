At a gas station. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS62
00:05:26,00 --> 00:05:33,50
He reaches for a bathroom door then notices a bloody fingerprint on the handle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS63
00:05:33,00 --> 00:05:37,50
A zombie bursts out. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS64
00:05:34,00 --> 00:05:44,50

ZOMBIELAND_DVS67
00:05:47,00 --> 00:05:54,50
She barrels through the last letter in the hovering words, Rule Number 1, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS69
00:05:52,00 --> 00:05:59,50
Circling back to his car door, the narrator drops his keys. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS70
00:05:56,00 --> 00:06:02,50
He ditches them and leads the zombies in another lap around the parking lot. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS71
00:06:01,00 --> 00:06:06,50

ZOMBIELAND_DVS72

Reaching his car again, the narrator grabs his keys and notices that the door is already unlocked. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS73
00:06:11,00 --> 00:06:17,50
He climbs in and locks it just as the zombies arrive. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS74
00:06:14,00 --> 00:06:19,50
Fastening his seat belt, he speeds off. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS75
00:06:16,00 --> 00:06:22,50
The zombies chase after him but quickly fall far behind. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS76
00:06:20,00 --> 00:06:26,50
The rear view mirror shows another one in the back seat. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS77
00:06:23,00 --> 00:06:28,50
The car weaves as the narrator fends him off. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS78
00:06:26,00 --> 00:06:33,50
He crashes into a planter sending the zombie flying out the windshield and into a building. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS79
00:06:30,00 --> 00:06:37,50
Words lock together, Rule Number 4, Seat belts. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS80
00:06:34,00 --> 00:06:40,50
The zombie reappears spitting out a mouthful of flowers. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS81
00:06:40,00 --> 00:06:48,50
As the narrators opens his shotgun's chamber, the infected man grabs at him through the hole in the windshield. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS82
00:06:45,00 --> 00:06:54,50
The narrator turns on his wipers to keep him at bay, then finishes reloading and shoots him in the shoulder. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS83
00:06:51,00 --> 00:06:56,50
The zombie topples off the car. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS84
00:06:53,00 --> 00:06:59,50
Staggering over, the narrator plugs him once more. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS86
00:06:58,00 --> 00:07:03,50
Words ping out from his shotgun's smoking barrel, Rule Number 2, Double Tap. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS88
00:07:01,00 --> 00:07:07,50
He slides down onto his butt with a small SOMEONE. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS89
00:07:09,00 --> 00:07:13,50
The picture fades to black. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS90
00:07:11,00 --> 00:07:17,50
Now a suitcase gets wheeled down a highway. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS91
00:07:46,00 --> 00:07:53,50
A black Cadillac Escalade speeds around a curve with a snow plow on its front bumper. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS92
00:07:51,00 --> 00:07:57,50
The narrator hurries for an abandoned hatchback on the grassy median. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS93
00:07:54,00 --> 00:08:01,50
The Escalade's front doors bear the number 3 written it white spray paint. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS94
00:07:58,00 --> 00:08:07,50
Its snow plow clips another car as it barrels into the median and speeds past a line of vehicles stopped on the road. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS95
00:08:04,00 --> 00:08:09,50
The narrator ducks behind the hatchback. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS96
00:08:07,00 --> 00:08:12,50
Pulling around in front of him, the Escalade comes to a stop. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS97
00:08:09,00 --> 00:08:16,50
The narrator stands up a motorbike for cover and points his shotgun over the seat. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS98
00:08:25,00 --> 00:08:33,50
The Escalade's front door opens and a pair of legs in cowboy boots and jeans steps out, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS99
00:08:30,00 --> 00:08:35,50
a long holster strapped to his thigh. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS100
00:08:32,00 --> 00:08:38,50
The thick jawed newcomer stares at the narrator through shades. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS101
00:08:36,00 --> 00:08:41,50
The shotgun trembles in the young man's hands. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS102
00:08:39,00 --> 00:08:45,50
The newcomer removes his shades under the brim of his canvas tarp hat 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS103
00:08:42,00 --> 00:08:47,50
and tosses them over his shoulder into his car. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS104
00:08:45,00 --> 00:08:50,50
As he draws a sawed off shotgun from his holster, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS105
00:08:47,00 --> 00:08:52,50
the narrator rises. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS106
00:08:49,00 --> 00:08:54,50
The newcomer quickly cocks his weapon. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS107
00:08:51,00 --> 00:08:57,50
The two men take aim at each other, the narrator trembling. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS108
00:08:55,00 --> 00:09:00,50
The newcomer sneers and cocks his head. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS109
00:08:57,00 --> 00:09:05,50
The narrator lets go of his shotgun's stock and extends a shaky thumb like a hitchhiker. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS110
00:09:02,00 --> 00:09:07,50
The newcomer nods toward his Escalade. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS111
00:09:05,00 --> 00:09:11,50
As the narrator wheels his suitcase around to the passenger side, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS112
00:09:08,00 --> 00:09:13,50
the thick jawed man kicks over the motorbike. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS113
00:09:17,00 --> 00:09:24,50
The narrator climbs into the Escalade's passenger seat then eyes the back. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS114
00:09:21,00 --> 00:09:26,50
Sitting at the wheel, the newcomer notices. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS115
00:09:27,00 --> 00:09:31,50
Check the backseat. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS116
00:09:29,00 --> 00:09:35,50
Under the thick jawed man's stern gaze, the narrator nods. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS117
00:09:39,00 --> 00:09:44,50
He draws a hunting knife, bumping a liquor bottle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS118
00:09:43,00 --> 00:09:47,50
The stranger uncaps the bottle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS119
00:09:51,00 --> 00:09:56,50
He fills a shot glass and hands it over. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS120
00:09:54,00 --> 00:10:00,50
The young man flings its contents out the window and pretends to drink. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS121
00:10:02,00 --> 00:10:06,50
The newcomer swigs from the bottle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS122
00:10:29,00 --> 00:10:34,50
He buckles himself in. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS123
00:10:33,00 --> 00:10:37,50
The Escalade pulls away. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS124
00:10:39,00 --> 00:10:45,50
A passenger jet's wreckage litters the road ahead. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS125
00:10:50,00 --> 00:10:55,50
In a flashback, he wields chainsaws. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS126
00:10:55,00 --> 00:11:00,50
Now, by a roadside ditch. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS127
00:11:05,00 --> 00:11:14,50
SOMEONE passes through a break in the guard rail and peers into the steep ditch. He pauses, facing SOMEONE. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS128
00:11:15,00 --> 00:11:22,50
The young man performs squats and knee lifts, working his arms with his shotgun. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS129
00:11:22,00 --> 00:11:27,50
A rule, Limber Up. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS130
00:11:25,00 --> 00:11:29,50
The text mimics his movements. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS131
00:11:35,00 --> 00:11:39,50
SOMEONE furrows his brow. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS132
00:11:37,00 --> 00:11:43,50
SOMEONE nods. With one last stretch of the neck, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS133
00:11:40,00 --> 00:11:45,50
the young man follows him down into the ditch. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS134
00:11:42,00 --> 00:11:49,50
The older man readies his gun as they near the abandoned delivery truck. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS135
00:11:46,00 --> 00:11:51,50
With a nod from SOMEONE, he kicks the rear door. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS136
00:11:49,00 --> 00:11:55,50
As the young man aims his shotgun at it, SOMEONE yanks it open. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS137
00:11:52,00 --> 00:12:00,50
Hundreds of double serving packages spill out, all containing pink round snack cakes. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS138
00:12:01,00 --> 00:12:05,50
SOMEONE takes one. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS139
00:12:03,00 --> 00:12:08,50
SOMEONE stomps on them. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS140
00:12:14,00 --> 00:12:20,50
SOMEONE eats one. SOMEONE picks one up then drops it. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS141
00:12:20,00 --> 00:12:25,50
As he steps away, SOMEONE swipes another snack cake. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS142
00:12:31,00 --> 00:12:38,50
Now outside a rest stop bathroom, SOMEONE practices knife attacks. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS144
00:12:43,00 --> 00:12:49,50
with the butt of his gun, SOMEONE whacks the stalls open one by one. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS145
00:12:57,00 --> 00:13:02,50
Now perched on a toilet, he tenses. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS146
00:13:02,00 --> 00:13:08,50
He grabs his gun. A clown crawls under the door. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS147
00:13:06,00 --> 00:13:12,50
It vanishes in a puff of smoke and SOMEONE relaxes. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS148
00:13:16,00 --> 00:13:20,50
A flashback. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS149
00:13:27,00 --> 00:13:31,50
He spills on himself. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS150
00:13:35,00 --> 00:13:39,50
He cleans up at a sink. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS151
00:14:04,00 --> 00:14:11,50
He opens up. A gorgeous blonde rushes in, locks the door, and embraces him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS152
00:14:15,00 --> 00:14:22,50
Later, SOMEONE pours bright red soda into a mug and offers it to his neighbor. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS153
00:14:21,00 --> 00:14:25,50
She gratefully accepts it. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS154
00:14:23,00 --> 00:14:30,50
As she drinks, he sits beside her with a resealable plastic bag filled with cereal. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS155
00:14:35,00 --> 00:14:38,50
She shakes her head. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS156
00:15:12,00 --> 00:15:16,50
She sips her drink. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS157
00:15:56,00 --> 00:16:01,50
She kisses his cheek and rests her head on his shoulder. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS158
00:16:08,00 --> 00:16:12,50
He reaches out but she looks up. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS159
00:16:11,00 --> 00:16:16,50
He quickly moves his hand to his hoodie and fidgets with it. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS160
00:16:14,00 --> 00:16:20,50
406 nestles into his chest and he gently lays his hand on her back. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS161
00:16:18,00 --> 00:16:22,50
Fade to black. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS162
00:16:21,00 --> 00:16:29,50
Later, SOMEONE wakes to find himself seemingly alone. A zombified 406 lunges close. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS163
00:16:28,00 --> 00:16:32,50
She tilts her head. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS164
00:16:30,00 --> 00:16:35,50
She slobbers vomitus goo. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS165
00:16:33,00 --> 00:16:39,50
He backs off of the couch and she leaps after him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS166
00:16:39,00 --> 00:16:45,50
406 swipes at him then chases him into the kitchen. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS167
00:16:42,00 --> 00:16:48,50
Cornered against the refrigerator, SOMEONE grabs a blender. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS168
00:16:49,00 --> 00:16:53,50
The pitcher falls off. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS169
00:16:51,00 --> 00:16:59,50
406 lunges and he flees. The zombie chases SOMEONE down the hall to his room. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS170
00:16:56,00 --> 00:17:02,50
He tries to shut her out but she blocks the door with her foot. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS171
00:16:59,00 --> 00:17:06,50
He makes repeated efforts, smashing her ankle until a bone juts out. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS172
00:17:06,00 --> 00:17:11,50
She squeezes in and chases him to a bathroom. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS173
00:17:08,00 --> 00:17:14,50
As SOMEONE struggles with the door, she flings him to the ground. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS174
00:17:12,00 --> 00:17:17,50
He takes the shower curtain with him, yanking it from the rod. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS175
00:17:15,00 --> 00:17:22,50
406 pounces on him and he wraps the plastic curtain tightly around her head. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS176
00:17:19,00 --> 00:17:25,50
Turning, he sits up and slams her against the wall. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS177
00:17:24,00 --> 00:17:31,50
The zombie's teeth chomp through the curtain and her tongue slithers out, dripping black slime. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS178
00:17:29,00 --> 00:17:39,50
Reaching into a cabinet, SOMEONE hurls cotton balls at her then toilet paper. He sprays her with an aerosol can and frees himself from her grasp. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS179
00:17:38,00 --> 00:17:44,50
As she crawls after him, he whacks her with the toilet tank lid. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS180
00:17:41,00 --> 00:17:47,50
He rushes from the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS181
00:17:51,00 --> 00:17:55,50
He holds the tank lid ready. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS182
00:17:52,00 --> 00:17:59,50
Now the zombie's hands shoots up and twists the bathroom door knob. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS184
00:17:57,00 --> 00:18:02,50
The door swings open and 406 pulls herself up. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS185
00:17:59,00 --> 00:18:06,50
SOMEONE gapes fearfully as she takes a step closer and convulses. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS186
00:18:16,00 --> 00:18:20,50
Her head leans back. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS187
00:18:19,00 --> 00:18:25,50
She hobbles at him, her broken ankle dragging behind her. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS188
00:18:22,00 --> 00:18:27,50
SOMEONE whacks her with the lid. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS189
00:18:24,00 --> 00:18:32,50
As her head spins toward us, the scene freezes and Rule Number 2 appears, Double Tap. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS190
00:18:29,00 --> 00:18:35,50
She falls. Now cars block a road. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS191
00:18:56,00 --> 00:19:04,50
As the guys approach a wrecked car, SOMEONE carefully checks the interior. Later, they push it down the road. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS192
00:19:27,00 --> 00:19:32,50
Later, they drive down the cleared lane. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS194
00:19:47,00 --> 00:19:52,50
He spots FedEx packages on the side of the road. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS195
00:20:20,00 --> 00:20:26,50
Blocking the road, a zombie devours the innards of a corpse. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS196
00:20:41,00 --> 00:20:46,50
The zombie snaps a bone in two and slurps out the marrow. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS197
00:20:56,00 --> 00:21:02,50
SOMEONE pulls forward, veering slightly to the side. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS198
00:20:59,00 --> 00:21:05,50
As he passes the zombie, he bashes her with his door. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS200
00:21:29,00 --> 00:21:34,50
Outside a grocery store, SOMEONE takes out a pick ax. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS201
00:21:32,00 --> 00:21:36,50
He returns it to a weapon stash. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS202
00:21:36,00 --> 00:21:41,50
He considers a ground tiller. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS203
00:22:01,00 --> 00:22:05,50
Now they face the entrance. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS204
00:22:04,00 --> 00:22:10,50
Loaded with weapons, SOMEONE leads SOMEONE inside. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS205
00:22:17,00 --> 00:22:22,50
SOMEONE plays a banjo. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS206
00:22:21,00 --> 00:22:26,50
The two gaze down a deserted aisle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS207
00:22:29,00 --> 00:22:35,50
An obese zombie trots into view and advances on them. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS208
00:22:32,00 --> 00:22:39,50
Wielding the banjo like a club, SOMEONE rushes to meet it. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS209
00:22:38,00 --> 00:22:46,50
He bashes the zombie in the face. As it goes down, he swings repeatedly at it, splattering our view with blood. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS210
00:22:43,00 --> 00:22:51,50
Another fat zombie arrives and chases SOMEONE toward his companion who now wields a bat. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS211
00:22:50,00 --> 00:22:54,50
He slides on his knees. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS212
00:22:51,00 --> 00:23:00,50
SOMEONE's bat catches the zombie's face. As the infected man lands at his feet, he smashes its head in. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS213
00:22:59,00 --> 00:23:05,50
He tosses his bat aside and they proceed down the aisle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS214
00:23:11,00 --> 00:23:16,50
A corpulent zombie blocks their path. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS215
00:23:14,00 --> 00:23:20,50
SOMEONE offers his shotgun but SOMEONE takes out pruning shears. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS216
00:23:21,00 --> 00:23:27,50
The narrator edges back as he looks on, his chest heaving. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS217
00:23:24,00 --> 00:23:30,50
The shears slide across the floor, their blades dripping blood. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS218
00:23:36,00 --> 00:23:42,50
A doe-eyed young woman with auburn hair marches out from the back. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS219
00:23:51,00 --> 00:23:56,50
SOMEONE follows her toward the back. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS220
00:23:58,00 --> 00:24:03,50
Finding an exit door, SOMEONE props it open with a box. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS221
00:24:05,00 --> 00:24:13,50
The rule appears over the door. In the back, SOMEONE finds the young woman comforting a 12 year old girl. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS222
00:24:10,00 --> 00:24:14,50
SOMEONE approaches him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS223
00:24:20,00 --> 00:24:24,50
SOMEONE brings him over. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS224
00:24:25,00 --> 00:24:30,50
He points to the young woman then the girl. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS225
00:24:35,00 --> 00:24:40,50
SOMEONE pulls SOMEONE and SOMEONE aside. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS226
00:24:43,00 --> 00:24:47,50
She eyes his shotgun. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS227
00:24:56,00 --> 00:25:00,50
He sees a bite on her arm. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS228
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:09,50
Behind SOMEONE, SOMEONE hangs her head. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS229
00:25:13,00 --> 00:25:17,50
SOMEONE stares at her. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS230
00:25:16,00 --> 00:25:20,50
She jerks her head toward SOMEONE. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS231
00:25:18,00 --> 00:25:23,50
He gravely steps forward, accepting the weapon. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS232
00:25:21,00 --> 00:25:26,50
SOMEONE moves away and Little SOMEONE's shoulders sag. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS233
00:25:24,00 --> 00:25:29,50
SOMEONE gently strokes her hair. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS234
00:25:26,00 --> 00:25:30,50
SOMEONE bites her lip. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS235
00:25:28,00 --> 00:25:34,50
SOMEONE stands with his back to them as SOMEONE takes aim. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS236
00:25:35,00 --> 00:25:40,50
SOMEONE lifts the barrel away from the girl. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS237
00:25:39,00 --> 00:25:47,50
Stepping forward, SOMEONE lays her hand on the weapon and gives SOMEONE a pleading look. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS238
00:25:45,00 --> 00:25:49,50
He grimly relinquishes it. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS240
00:25:47,00 --> 00:25:52,50
Turning away, SOMEONE plugs his ears with his fingers. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS242
00:25:50,00 --> 00:25:56,50
SOMEONE looks to her little sister who gives a brave nod. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS243
00:25:53,00 --> 00:25:58,50
The young woman kisses the girl's forehead. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS244
00:25:59,00 --> 00:26:06,50
Stepping back, SOMEONE checks the double barrel chamber and finds it fully loaded. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS246
00:26:05,00 --> 00:26:10,50
She aims at her sister who bites her lip in a suppressed sob. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS247
00:26:07,00 --> 00:26:12,50
SOMEONE steps forward. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS248
00:26:13,00 --> 00:26:17,50
She aims at him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS249
00:26:19,00 --> 00:26:24,50
Little SOMEONE takes his sawed off shotgun. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS250
00:26:28,00 --> 00:26:35,50
Holding the men at gunpoint, the sisters leave. SOMEONE flips them off. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS251
00:26:38,00 --> 00:26:45,50
Later, SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch the sisters drive off in the Escalade. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS252
00:26:46,00 --> 00:26:50,50
With the sisters. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS253
00:26:49,00 --> 00:26:54,50
SOMEONE flips up her sun visor. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS254
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:18,50
The sisters share a wistful smile. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS255
00:27:17,00 --> 00:27:23,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE hike through a deserted town. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS256
00:28:21,00 --> 00:28:26,50
He throws rock through its windows. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS257
00:28:28,00 --> 00:28:33,50
He attacks it with a crowbar. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS258
00:28:41,00 --> 00:28:47,50
From the minivan's roof, SOMEONE tosses the crowbar aside, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS259
00:28:44,00 --> 00:28:49,50
hops down, and limps over to SOMEONE. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS260
00:28:50,00 --> 00:28:55,50
Rule Number 18 appears on the bumper, Limber Up. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS261
00:28:56,00 --> 00:29:01,50
The words topple over, landing on the pavement. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS262
00:29:07,00 --> 00:29:11,50
He jogs to a yellow Hummer. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS263
00:29:10,00 --> 00:29:19,50
SOMEONE follows, toting their bags. The older man slows wearily as he nears the vehicle which has crashed near a house. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS264
00:29:19,00 --> 00:29:25,50
The driver's side window shows hands gripping the steering wheel. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS265
00:29:23,00 --> 00:29:30,50
SOMEONE cautiously opens the door and finds the hands gnawed off at the forearm. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS266
00:29:28,00 --> 00:29:34,50
Using a rag, he tugs at one of the disembodied appendages. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS267
00:29:34,00 --> 00:29:41,50
He pries it loose. Facing SOMEONE, he extends the middle finger. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS268
00:29:41,00 --> 00:29:47,50
SOMEONE checks the back as SOMEONE hot wires the engine. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS269
00:29:44,00 --> 00:29:50,50
Rule Number 31 appears over a large canvas bag, Check the Back Seat. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS271
00:29:49,00 --> 00:29:54,50
Opening the sack, the guys find it loaded with guns. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS272
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:04,50
He picks up a rifle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS273
00:30:04,00 --> 00:30:11,50
Now SOMEONE stands behind the Hummer, firing an automatic into the air. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS274
00:30:08,00 --> 00:30:16,50
As SOMEONE waits patiently in the passenger seat, the rear window shows his companion jumping giddily up and down. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS275
00:30:14,00 --> 00:30:20,50
Later, the older man paints a black 3 on the driver's side door. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS276
00:30:17,00 --> 00:30:25,50
As the wide bodied vehicle backs away from the house, it takes out a beam supporting an overhang. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS277
00:30:22,00 --> 00:30:27,50
The roof collapses as the Hummer speeds off. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS278
00:30:54,00 --> 00:31:04,50
A flashback shows him serving a terrier mutt pancakes, giving him a bath, and swaying as he cradles the dog in his arms. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS279
00:31:47,00 --> 00:31:55,50
Now on a country highway, the Escalade sits parked with its hood up. SOMEONE studies it through binoculars. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS280
00:31:57,00 --> 00:32:01,50
He grabs a rifle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS281
00:32:02,00 --> 00:32:06,50
He chambers a round. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS282
00:32:06,00 --> 00:32:12,50
He swaggers off and SOMEONE steps behind the Hummer's open door. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS283
00:32:11,00 --> 00:32:18,50
As SOMEONE nears the Escalade, he finds the word, Help, painted on the side, using the 3 as an HELP. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS285
00:32:17,00 --> 00:32:24,50
He scans the surrounding fields and the cylindrical hay bales dotting them. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS287
00:32:23,00 --> 00:32:31,50
Aiming the gun inside the vehicle, SOMEONE peeks through the Escalade's open driver's window then yanks open the rear door and checks the back. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS288
00:32:29,00 --> 00:32:35,50
He finds it empty and bends over to survey the undercarriage. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS289
00:32:34,00 --> 00:32:43,50
A flannel shirt hangs from the hood, flapping in the breeze. He unhooks it then tosses it on the steaming engine. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS290
00:32:43,00 --> 00:32:49,50
Slinging the rifle over his shoulder with its strap, he cups his hands to his mouth. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS291
00:32:48,00 --> 00:32:53,50
Grinning, he waves SOMEONE over. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS292
00:32:50,00 --> 00:32:56,50
The Hummer pulls forward and SOMEONE strides back to meet it. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS293
00:32:53,00 --> 00:32:59,50
He opens the passenger door and gets in. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS294
00:32:58,00 --> 00:33:03,50
SOMEONE nods uneasily. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS295
00:33:05,00 --> 00:33:12,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE who's gaze darts. SOMEONE frowns. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS296
00:33:12,00 --> 00:33:17,50
Little SOMEONE aims her shotgun at him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS297
00:33:28,00 --> 00:33:33,50
She shoots out the moon roof. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS298
00:33:31,00 --> 00:33:36,50
He hands over his rifle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS299
00:33:41,00 --> 00:33:46,50
SOMEONE emerges from behind a hay bale. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS300
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:54,50
SOMEONE waves. Aiming at him, SOMEONE gives a mocking wince. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS301
00:33:53,00 --> 00:33:57,50
He unbuckles his seat belt. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS302
00:33:56,00 --> 00:34:02,50
As she lowers the gun, he and SOMEONE climb out. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS303
00:34:01,00 --> 00:34:07,50
SOMEONE gets behind the wheel and swaps grins with her sister in back. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS304
00:34:04,00 --> 00:34:10,50
Later, SOMEONE drives. SOMEONE thinks to himself. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS305
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:17,50
She eyeballs him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS306
00:34:18,00 --> 00:34:26,50
In a flashback, at a Gas N Gulp, the pasty blonde man from the toilet attack notices SOMEONE outside 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS307
00:34:23,00 --> 00:34:28,50
crawling around on her hands and knees. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS308
00:34:26,00 --> 00:34:31,50
As he heads out of the station, she peeks under her red convertible. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS309
00:34:29,00 --> 00:34:34,50
Her tight skirts shows the curves of her toned rear. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS310
00:34:59,00 --> 00:35:04,50
She hands him a business card. He grins. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS311
00:35:11,00 --> 00:35:17,50
Behind the wheel, SOMEONE gives a disarming smile. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS312
00:35:15,00 --> 00:35:20,50
The manager waves and she drives off. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS313
00:35:20,00 --> 00:35:28,50
As the convertible pulls toward the street, the manager scans the ground by the pump. Later, he uses a phone. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS314
00:35:30,00 --> 00:35:36,50
Little SOMEONE finds the ring outside. The girl grins. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS315
00:35:38,00 --> 00:35:42,50
He marches out to her. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS316
00:35:47,00 --> 00:35:51,50
Now he hands her cash. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS317
00:35:55,00 --> 00:36:00,50
Little SOMEONE stares at the ring then hands it over. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS318
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:04,50
She eats a candy bar. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS319
00:36:02,00 --> 00:36:08,50
She strolls out, leaving the manager grinning. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS320
00:36:05,00 --> 00:36:12,50
Now on a suburban street, Little SOMEONE strides up to the convertible and gets in. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS321
00:36:13,00 --> 00:36:17,50
She opens the glove box. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS322
00:36:16,00 --> 00:36:22,50
The young con artist pours a handful of rings out of an envelope. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS323
00:36:27,00 --> 00:36:31,50
The convertible speeds off. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS324
00:36:36,00 --> 00:36:41,50
Back the present, SOMEONE faces SOMEONE. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS325
00:36:41,00 --> 00:36:49,50
SOMEONE steals his gun back and aims at Little SOMEONE. SOMEONE stops then aims at him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS326
00:37:08,00 --> 00:37:12,50
SOMEONE lowers his gun. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS327
00:37:10,00 --> 00:37:16,50
SOMEONE averts her aim as well, setting her handgun in her lap. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS328
00:37:14,00 --> 00:37:21,50
She glares at SOMEONE through the rear view mirror and irritably shakes her head 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS329
00:37:18,00 --> 00:37:23,50
then grips the wheel and drives off. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS330
00:37:35,00 --> 00:37:39,50
SOMEONE glares at him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS331
00:38:00,00 --> 00:38:04,50
Little SOMEONE gives a wounded look. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS332
00:38:11,00 --> 00:38:16,50
SOMEONE thoughtfully arches his brows. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS333
00:38:25,00 --> 00:38:31,50
SOMEONE taps her shoulder with the tip of his sawed off shotgun. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS335
00:38:29,00 --> 00:38:35,50
She looks back at him and he pointedly glances at SOMEONE who sits gaping. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS336
00:38:32,00 --> 00:38:37,50
SOMEONE nods. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS337
00:38:35,00 --> 00:38:39,50
He bobs his head. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS338
00:38:40,00 --> 00:38:44,50
He grows thoughtful. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS340
00:39:10,00 --> 00:39:14,50
He shifts his stare to the window. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS341
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:22,50
The Hummer speeds past a desolate farm. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS343
00:39:20,00 --> 00:39:26,50
As Little SOMEONE and SOMEONE sleep in the back seat, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS344
00:39:23,00 --> 00:39:29,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE gaze blankly through the windshield. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS345
00:39:26,00 --> 00:39:32,50
SOMEONE glances over her shoulder at her sister. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS346
00:39:45,00 --> 00:39:51,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE then looks away just as she turns to face him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS347
00:39:48,00 --> 00:39:53,50
She notices an abandoned pickup. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS348
00:39:53,00 --> 00:40:00,50
She slows to a stop in front of it and lets her hands drop from the wheel. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS349
00:40:08,00 --> 00:40:13,50
She offers a weak smile. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS350
00:40:10,00 --> 00:40:18,50
SOMEONE glances away and unlatches his seat belt then slowly guides it off his chest. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS351
00:40:15,00 --> 00:40:22,50
As he opens the door, SOMEONE uneasily licks her lips then locks eyes with him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS352
00:40:32,00 --> 00:40:39,50
SOMEONE shuts the door, remaining seated, and SOMEONE smiles. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS353
00:40:36,00 --> 00:40:42,50
He pulls his seat belt back across his chest and fastens it. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS354
00:40:40,00 --> 00:40:46,50
SOMEONE takes the wheel and motors off, driving away from the pickup. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS356
00:40:46,00 --> 00:40:51,50
Now as the horizon glows dimly, the Hummer moves through a low fog. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS357
00:40:55,00 --> 00:40:59,50
SOMEONE reads a billboard. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS358
00:41:04,00 --> 00:41:12,50
Later, they pull into native American trading post themed rest stop that a sign labels, The Kemosabe. Lights glow within. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS360
00:41:11,00 --> 00:41:16,50
SOMEONE struts up to the porch, munching a snack. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS361
00:41:15,00 --> 00:41:19,50
He halts the others. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS362
00:41:17,00 --> 00:41:21,50
He eyes the open door. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS364
00:41:30,00 --> 00:41:34,50
SOMEONE thinks. The rule appears. Don't be a hero. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS365
00:41:34,00 --> 00:41:40,50
SOMEONE taps a bell above the doorway with his sawed off shotgun. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS366
00:41:39,00 --> 00:41:45,50
Staying out of its line of sight, SOMEONE shoots a zombie as it runs out. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS367
00:41:44,00 --> 00:41:50,50
It gets back up. SOMEONE takes it out. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS368
00:41:57,00 --> 00:42:06,50
As SOMEONE calmly tugs a rope and enters a building, a piano plummets onto a zombie running after her. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS369
00:42:04,00 --> 00:42:10,50
Back at Kemosabe's, SOMEONE smells a bottle of cologne. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS370
00:42:07,00 --> 00:42:14,50
Nearby, SOMEONE tries on an embellished felt sombrero. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS371
00:42:11,00 --> 00:42:17,50
He waves at her through a mirror and she waves back then doffs the hat. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS372
00:42:14,00 --> 00:42:20,50
SOMEONE spritzes his upraised wrist with cologne, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS373
00:42:17,00 --> 00:42:22,50
sniffs it, and rubs it on his neck. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS374
00:42:19,00 --> 00:42:26,50
As SOMEONE ambles to a postcard rack behind him, SOMEONE sniffs another bottle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS375
00:42:40,00 --> 00:42:46,50
SOMEONE follows SOMEONE's gaze to SOMEONE. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS376
00:42:57,00 --> 00:43:01,50
He sniffs SOMEONE. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS377
00:43:01,00 --> 00:43:06,50
As heads off, SOMEONE sprays him with cologne. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS378
00:43:03,00 --> 00:43:10,50
SOMEONE whirls around, fuming. SOMEONE stutters. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS379
00:43:25,00 --> 00:43:30,50
SOMEONE punches him. He stumbles. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS380
00:43:29,00 --> 00:43:36,50
SOMEONE steps over. Chest heaving, SOMEONE grins and knocks over a vase. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS381
00:43:35,00 --> 00:43:41,50
He drops another. SOMEONE slides a mug off of a display. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS382
00:43:40,00 --> 00:43:49,50
SOMEONE kicks a figurine. SOMEONE swings her gun like a bat downing a pyramid of rawhide drums. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS383
00:43:48,00 --> 00:43:56,50
SOMEONE hurls a statue into a glass counter and Little SOMEONE smashes a snow globe. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS384
00:43:53,00 --> 00:43:58,50
SOMEONE shatters a glass shelf. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS385
00:43:55,00 --> 00:44:02,50
Wearing an Indian headdress, Little SOMEONE romps as feathers rain down around her. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS386
00:43:59,00 --> 00:44:08,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE toss handfuls of beads at each other and SOMEONE bashes a mannequin. Its arm flies off. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS387
00:44:06,00 --> 00:44:14,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE overturn a table of beads as SOMEONE hacks at a cowboy mannequin's neck with an ax. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS388
00:44:12,00 --> 00:44:21,50
SOMEONE pitches a stuffed animal at him and he bats it away then smashes the glass over an educational Arizona display. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS389
00:44:18,00 --> 00:44:26,50
He and SOMEONE bowl over a shelving unit which topples three more units like dominoes. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS390
00:44:28,00 --> 00:44:33,50
Later, SOMEONE muses. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS392
00:44:37,00 --> 00:44:43,50
The rule dangles from a chandelier. Later, the Hummer drives away. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS393
00:44:43,00 --> 00:44:49,50
SOMEONE drives and Little SOMEONE rides shotgun. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS394
00:44:53,00 --> 00:44:57,50
SOMEONE drives. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS395
00:45:02,00 --> 00:45:06,50
Little SOMEONE drives. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS397
00:45:14,00 --> 00:45:18,50
SOMEONE drives. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS399
00:45:32,00 --> 00:45:39,50
now Little SOMEONE sleeps on SOMEONE's shoulder. SOMEONE unbuckles his seat belt. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS400
00:45:41,00 --> 00:45:46,50
Daytime. They pass the California border. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS401
00:45:53,00 --> 00:45:59,50
Later on a highway, the Hummer passes a Welcome to Los Angeles sign. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS402
00:45:57,00 --> 00:46:04,50
Cars and rubble lie strewn on the road and skyscrapers dot the horizon. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS403
00:46:01,00 --> 00:46:09,50
The four survivors stare soberly at their surroundings, SOMEONE behind the wheel. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS404
00:46:06,00 --> 00:46:14,50
SOMEONE sighs at the crammed together buildings. Behind him, SOMEONE's hair blows in the wind. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS405
00:46:12,00 --> 00:46:19,50
The thoughtful young man contemplatively cocks his head as they drive through an industrial area. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS406
00:46:17,00 --> 00:46:21,50
Later, they pass theaters in Hollywood. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS407
00:46:38,00 --> 00:46:46,50
As zombies stagger nearby, they drive up to Gromlin's Chinese Theater. A sign reads, Stop Contagion. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS408
00:46:45,00 --> 00:46:52,50
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE hop out, a zombie dressed as SOMEONE runs at them. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS409
00:46:49,00 --> 00:46:55,50
They blast two others and SOMEONE grabs a star map. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS410
00:46:54,00 --> 00:46:58,50
They get back in. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS411
00:46:56,00 --> 00:47:04,50
SOMEONE shuts the door as a group of zombies reach the vehicle. Later on a street lined with palm trees, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS412
00:47:22,00 --> 00:47:28,50
the Hummer pulls onto a fenced in drive in front of a sprawling mansion. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS413
00:47:25,00 --> 00:47:30,50
Golden initials adorn a security gate. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS414
00:47:33,00 --> 00:47:42,50
Later, the companions enter the foyer. Six foot urns bookend the door and a grand staircase leads to a second story. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS415
00:47:41,00 --> 00:47:46,50
Crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS416
00:47:43,00 --> 00:47:53,50
Later in a sitting room, a pop art painting shows tiled images of SOMEONE's face in bright candy colors. The survivors enter. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS417
00:48:15,00 --> 00:48:19,50
He sneers. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS418
00:48:17,00 --> 00:48:23,50
Now in a kitchen, Little SOMEONE opens a nearly empty cupboard. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS419
00:48:33,00 --> 00:48:37,50
They split up. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS420
00:48:37,00 --> 00:48:42,50
Later, SOMEONE and Little SOMEONE creep down a hallway. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS421
00:48:41,00 --> 00:48:47,50
The slink into an anteroom with a baby grand piano and a popcorn machine. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS422
00:48:48,00 --> 00:48:53,50
Open doors reveal a home theater. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS423
00:48:52,00 --> 00:48:57,50
SOMEONE gapes and the girl grins. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS424
00:48:59,00 --> 00:49:04,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE enter a bedroom. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS425
00:49:03,00 --> 00:49:07,50
He jumps toward the canopy bed. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS426
00:49:06,00 --> 00:49:12,50
The zombie killer flops down and crawls off of it. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS427
00:49:11,00 --> 00:49:17,50
In the home theater, a movie plays. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS428
00:49:24,00 --> 00:49:29,50
Little SOMEONE nods skeptically. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS429
00:49:26,00 --> 00:49:31,50
Now a figure lies on a four column bed. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS430
00:49:29,00 --> 00:49:34,50
His pale hand twitches, stroking the furry bedspread 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS431
00:49:32,00 --> 00:49:37,50
and a stocky man with scraggly hair sits up. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS432
00:49:34,00 --> 00:49:39,50
He lowers his feet to the leopard print carpet 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS433
00:49:37,00 --> 00:49:43,50
and shifts around in his oxford shoes then steps off. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS435
00:49:44,00 --> 00:49:48,50
In the sitting room, SOMEONE dances. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS436
00:49:46,00 --> 00:49:51,50
He plops onto a couch. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS437
00:49:49,00 --> 00:49:55,50
As he waves his booted feet in the air, SOMEONE drifts away. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS438
00:49:54,00 --> 00:49:59,50
He tugs off his boots. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS439
00:49:56,00 --> 00:50:01,50
Now the oxfords make their way down a hall. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS440
00:49:58,00 --> 00:50:05,50
The scraggly haired man stiffly shifts one shoulder then turns a corner. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS441
00:50:02,00 --> 00:50:09,50
In the sitting room, SOMEONE swings a golf club, practicing her drives. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS442
00:50:06,00 --> 00:50:11,50
SOMEONE dances. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS443
00:50:11,00 --> 00:50:17,50
A ricocheted ball whacks the back of his shaved head. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS445
00:50:18,00 --> 00:50:25,50
The zombified SOMEONE staggers in, arms outstretched, mouth bloodied. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS446
00:50:24,00 --> 00:50:30,50
He reaches toward SOMEONE. SOMEONE clubs him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS447
00:51:24,00 --> 00:51:29,50
SOMEONE mimes fanning away tears. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS448
00:51:41,00 --> 00:51:48,50
SOMEONE excitedly punches the air then shakes the movie star's hand. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS449
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:52,50
He kisses his hand. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS450
00:51:52,00 --> 00:51:56,50
SOMEONE bows and mouths, "Thank you." 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS451
00:51:54,00 --> 00:51:58,50
SOMEONE eyes him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS452
00:51:57,00 --> 00:52:01,50
He lifts his wig. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS453
00:52:18,00 --> 00:52:28,50
Now SOMEONE lights a bowl of marijuana atop a hookah pipe while SOMEONE and SOMEONE each draw in a hose. Smoke rises to a crystal chandelier. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS455
00:52:35,00 --> 00:52:41,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hurry over, pretending to be Ghostbusters. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS456
00:52:41,00 --> 00:52:47,50
SOMEONE wears a full costume. SOMEONE wields a vacuum cleaner. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS457
00:52:46,00 --> 00:52:51,50
The electricity fizzles out, surprising them both. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS459
00:53:17,00 --> 00:53:23,50
In the home theater, SOMEONE nonchalantly dumps their popcorn bowl. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS460
00:53:28,00 --> 00:53:34,50
SOMEONE puts on his scraggly wig and plods ahead like a zombie. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS461
00:53:35,00 --> 00:53:41,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE crack up as SOMEONE enters the home theater. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS462
00:53:39,00 --> 00:53:44,50
SOMEONE springs up and shoots SOMEONE in the chest. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS463
00:53:43,00 --> 00:53:47,50
SOMEONE collapses into a seat. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS464
00:53:46,00 --> 00:53:54,50
SOMEONE gawks. SOMEONE hangs on SOMEONE whose argyle sweater now bares a bloody hole. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS465
00:54:12,00 --> 00:54:16,50
SOMEONE touches the wound. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS466
00:54:17,00 --> 00:54:23,50
SOMEONE turns his sad wry gaze on SOMEONE. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS467
00:54:40,00 --> 00:54:43,50
They nod. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS468
00:54:40,00 --> 00:54:45,50
Dying, SOMEONE exhales. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS469
00:55:02,00 --> 00:55:07,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE eye SOMEONE. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS470
00:55:11,00 --> 00:55:16,50
Later, they haul SOMEONE outside. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS471
00:55:16,00 --> 00:55:20,50
They bump his head on a door frame. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS472
00:55:17,00 --> 00:55:23,50
They carry SOMEONE wrapped in a blanket across a balcony, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS473
00:55:20,00 --> 00:55:25,50
but drop him before they reach the railing. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS474
00:55:27,00 --> 00:55:32,50
Now they give a four gun salute. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS475
00:55:33,00 --> 00:55:37,50
SOMEONE stops to reload. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS477
00:55:47,00 --> 00:55:51,50
They roll SOMEONE off the mansion balcony. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS478
00:55:52,00 --> 00:55:58,50
At night, they play Monopoly by a fancy fireplace. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS479
00:56:59,00 --> 00:57:04,50
SOMEONE's face seizes tearfully 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS480
00:57:02,00 --> 00:57:06,50
then we see him in a sunny kitchen. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS481
00:57:04,00 --> 00:57:10,50
He serves a fresh pancake to a towheaded little boy in a high chair. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS482
00:57:08,00 --> 00:57:14,50
The tot smiles and points and SOMEONE adds syrup. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS483
00:57:12,00 --> 00:57:19,50
As Buck takes a bath, SOMEONE playfully scoops mounds of suds onto the boy's head. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS485
00:57:19,00 --> 00:57:24,50
Outside by a blossoming tree, he twirls the happy boy in his arms. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS486
00:57:21,00 --> 00:57:26,50
Now back with the survivors. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS487
00:57:26,00 --> 00:57:33,50
The open wallet contains two cherished snapshots of the bright faced boy. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS488
00:57:30,00 --> 00:57:35,50
SOMEONE takes a close look. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS489
00:57:37,00 --> 00:57:41,50
SOMEONE pats his arm. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS490
00:57:50,00 --> 00:57:56,50
He dabs his tears with real cash from the Monopoly board. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS491
00:57:54,00 --> 00:57:59,50
The four survivors sit pensively by the hearth. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS492
00:57:58,00 --> 00:58:03,50
Now a porcelain vase explodes. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS493
00:58:02,00 --> 00:58:08,50
At the edge of an empty indoor pool, SOMEONE shoots valuables. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS494
00:58:05,00 --> 00:58:09,50
Little SOMEONE joins him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS495
00:58:10,00 --> 00:58:15,50
She lies on a chaise next to him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS496
00:58:12,00 --> 00:58:18,50
As she reaches for a gun, he targets another objet d'art 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS497
00:58:17,00 --> 00:58:23,50
Little SOMEONE takes aim with a pump action shotgun. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS498
00:58:27,00 --> 00:58:32,50
Little SOMEONE irritably lets her gun droop. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS499
00:58:29,00 --> 00:58:34,50
SOMEONE looks at her. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS501
00:58:43,00 --> 00:58:48,50
Little SOMEONE lines up a shot. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS502
00:58:50,00 --> 00:58:57,50
A dinner plate explodes. Little SOMEONE grins. SOMEONE returns a rugged nod. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS503
00:58:55,00 --> 00:59:03,50
Now gripping a bottle of wine, SOMEONE watches SOMEONE on the sly as he straightens some wall art 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS504
00:59:00,00 --> 00:59:04,50
and sniffs a knick knack. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS505
00:59:04,00 --> 00:59:09,50
She taps the bottle on the door frame, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS506
00:59:06,00 --> 00:59:10,50
getting SOMEONE's attention, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS507
00:59:08,00 --> 00:59:13,50
then flourishes a hand in front of the unopened bottle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS508
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:16,50
SOMEONE tweaks another trinket then approaches. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS509
00:59:17,00 --> 00:59:21,50
She leads the way. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS510
00:59:19,00 --> 00:59:26,50
SOMEONE shoots a glance back then follows. Later, he reads a label by candlelight. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS511
00:59:55,00 --> 01:00:00,50
SOMEONE swigs from the bottle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS512
01:00:20,00 --> 01:00:24,50
SOMEONE swigs from the bottle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS513
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:50,50
He takes another drink. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS514
01:01:01,00 --> 01:01:06,50
She sets the wine aside. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS515
01:01:05,00 --> 01:01:09,50
She offers her hand. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS516
01:01:06,00 --> 01:01:10,50
SOMEONE swigs more wine. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS517
01:01:10,00 --> 01:01:16,50
SOMEONE tugs his hand, pulling him to his feet. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS519
01:01:16,00 --> 01:01:25,50
Affecting the awkwardness of a middle schooler, SOMEONE plunks her wrists on SOMEONE's shoulders and stands at arm's length from him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS520
01:01:22,00 --> 01:01:27,50
He copies, holding her shoulders, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS521
01:01:24,00 --> 01:01:29,50
but SOMEONE wryly cocks her head. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS522
01:01:27,00 --> 01:01:33,50
She sways her shoulders, prompting his hands to her waist, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS523
01:01:30,00 --> 01:01:35,50
then smiles through an exhaled laugh. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS525
01:01:33,00 --> 01:01:39,50
They sway stiffly then SOMEONE draws him a tiny bit closer. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS526
01:01:36,00 --> 01:01:43,50
In reply, he lets his hands move from her hips to the small of her back. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS527
01:01:40,00 --> 01:01:47,50
Soon they touch tummies and their heads nestle cheek to cheek. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS528
01:02:08,00 --> 01:02:13,50
They separate enough to look into each other's eyes. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS529
01:02:18,00 --> 01:02:26,50
He nods. Gradually, in tiny starts and stops, their faces come closer and closer together. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS531
01:02:26,00 --> 01:02:31,50
SOMEONE caresses his neck and their lips hover less than an inch apart. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS532
01:02:33,00 --> 01:02:39,50
SOMEONE leaves them in the awkward aftermath. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS533
01:02:37,00 --> 01:02:42,50
They exchange a collegial nod. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS534
01:02:52,00 --> 01:02:57,50
She leaves him in the candlelit room. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS536
01:02:56,00 --> 01:03:02,50
Cloth lies draped over several high backed chairs. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS537
01:02:59,00 --> 01:03:04,50
SOMEONE sleeps under the makeshift fort. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS538
01:03:01,00 --> 01:03:07,50
As does SOMEONE in his boxers and t-shirt. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS539
01:03:14,00 --> 01:03:20,50
As the yellow Hummer speeds off, SOMEONE and SOMEONE look on. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS540
01:03:24,00 --> 01:03:28,50
With the girls. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS541
01:03:34,00 --> 01:03:42,50
Now the Hollywood sign shows in the distance as the Hummer follows a boulevard past an old tank and some rubble. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS542
01:03:39,00 --> 01:03:46,50
Later, roller coasters and a SOMEONE wheel peak above a lush horizon. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS543
01:03:43,00 --> 01:03:48,50
At dusk, the Hummer crosses a vast parking lot. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS544
01:03:58,00 --> 01:04:03,50
Both girls smile as they drive forward. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS545
01:04:00,00 --> 01:04:05,50
The sun hangs low in the sky 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS546
01:04:02,00 --> 01:04:08,50
and the silhouettes of the dormant rides loom before them. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS547
01:04:06,00 --> 01:04:13,50
Headlights gleaming, the dusty Hummer halts inches before the park's main gate. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS548
01:04:10,00 --> 01:04:16,50
SOMEONE smiles at her sister then shifts gears. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS549
01:04:18,00 --> 01:04:29,50
The chain locked gate yields easily. Little SOMEONE beams as they pull onto the grounds. Back in SOMEONE's mansion, SOMEONE boxes up some supplies. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS550
01:04:32,00 --> 01:04:37,50
SOMEONE holds a surfboard. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS551
01:04:44,00 --> 01:04:49,50
He wears a double beer can sipping helmet. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS553
01:05:04,00 --> 01:05:10,50
On foot, SOMEONE advances with her gun and a flashlight. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS555
01:05:10,00 --> 01:05:18,50
She opens a door labeled with a voltage sign. She checks the room first, eyes a row of utility boxes and swings a lever on each one to its downward position. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS556
01:05:16,00 --> 01:05:21,50
The park lights up, section by section. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS557
01:05:30,00 --> 01:05:38,50
Outside, Little SOMEONE smiles at the wonderland of mini lights decorating trees, buildings, and fences. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS558
01:05:35,00 --> 01:05:41,50
A roller coaster banks low on its tracks. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS559
01:05:38,00 --> 01:05:43,50
SOMEONE smiles at her happy sister. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS560
01:05:40,00 --> 01:05:48,50
In a nearby town, four scavenging zombies look toward the electrified amusement park. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS561
01:05:45,00 --> 01:05:51,50
Bloody ooze pours from a female zombie's mouth. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS563
01:05:51,00 --> 01:05:57,50
As they lope off in the direction of the park, other zombies by a broken down semi notice the park too. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS564
01:05:54,00 --> 01:06:04,50
Meanwhile, the uninfected girls ride on the rear most seat of a swinging pirate ship with an Egyptian pharaoh head on one end. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS565
01:06:06,00 --> 01:06:14,50
Now zombies cross the play land parking lot, but the girls remain oblivious. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS566
01:06:13,00 --> 01:06:21,50
By the dozens, the ghoulish cannibals pour through the park gates and climb the fences. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS568
01:06:21,00 --> 01:06:26,50
As they swarm over a go-cart track, the girls spot them from the swinging pharaoh ship. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS569
01:06:23,00 --> 01:06:28,50
Little SOMEONE's smile evaporates. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS570
01:06:28,00 --> 01:06:34,50
The zombies draw closer. Now in SOMEONE's mansion. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS571
01:06:42,00 --> 01:06:46,50
SOMEONE moves out. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS572
01:06:46,00 --> 01:06:53,50
Now the girls run from a pack of zombies. SOMEONE drops one with a keen shot. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS573
01:06:52,00 --> 01:06:57,50
She blows away a second one as they approach the Hummer. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS574
01:06:57,00 --> 01:07:03,50
As SOMEONE pegs another, Little SOMEONE barely makes it into the passenger seat. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS575
01:07:01,00 --> 01:07:06,50
A crazed zombie slobbers on her window. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS576
01:07:03,00 --> 01:07:08,50
SOMEONE climbs safely behind the wheel. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS577
01:07:08,00 --> 01:07:12,50
Zombies swarm the Hummer. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS578
01:07:11,00 --> 01:07:21,50
The passenger side window shatters. As Little SOMEONE kicks at her attacker, SOMEONE throws the Hummer into drive and speeds off, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS579
01:07:18,00 --> 01:07:23,50
leaving several zombies on the ground. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS580
01:07:20,00 --> 01:07:25,50
A few still cling to the roof. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS581
01:07:28,00 --> 01:07:35,50
Both girls leap from the vehicle which races on with the zombies still aboard. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS582
01:07:32,00 --> 01:07:39,50
The girls watch the runaway Hummer plow through a prize booth and nosedive into a lake. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS583
01:07:36,00 --> 01:07:41,50
SOMEONE checks on Little SOMEONE. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS584
01:07:47,00 --> 01:07:53,50
As they retrieve their guns, more zombies come after them. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS585
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:55,50
SOMEONE fires. Little SOMEONE points nearby. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS586
01:07:55,00 --> 01:08:02,50
A multi-story drop tower ride glitters yards across the park. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS587
01:07:59,00 --> 01:08:06,50
SOMEONE lays down defensive fire as she and Little SOMEONE head for it. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS588
01:08:03,00 --> 01:08:09,50
The older girl unleashes a deadly series of shots. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS589
01:08:06,00 --> 01:08:14,50
Back at SOMEONE Murray's, SOMEONE faces SOMEONE who sits astride a customized motorcycle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS590
01:08:25,00 --> 01:08:29,50
SOMEONE pats him on the shoulder. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS591
01:08:34,00 --> 01:08:39,50
SOMEONE straps on a helmet and hits the kick starter. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS592
01:08:39,00 --> 01:08:47,50
As SOMEONE rolls out of SOMEONE's garage, SOMEONE stares solemnly after him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS593
01:08:44,00 --> 01:08:51,50
SOMEONE wavers on the chopper, accelerates into the bushes, and falls off. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS594
01:08:53,00 --> 01:09:00,50
As SOMEONE pushes himself up, SOMEONE pulls an SUV out of the garage. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS595
01:08:57,00 --> 01:09:02,50
He rolls down the passenger side window. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS596
01:09:06,00 --> 01:09:11,50
Clutching his shotgun and suitcase, SOMEONE climbs in. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS597
01:09:09,00 --> 01:09:15,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE and Little SOMEONE race through the gate of the drop ride. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS598
01:09:12,00 --> 01:09:19,50
As SOMEONE fires, blood spurts from the chest of a pursuing zombie. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS599
01:09:18,00 --> 01:09:24,50
As Little SOMEONE hurries toward a row of seats at the base of the tower, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS600
01:09:21,00 --> 01:09:27,50
SOMEONE presses a button on a nearby control panel. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS601
01:09:24,00 --> 01:09:30,50
The two sisters pull the ride's safety harnesses over their shoulders 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS602
01:09:27,00 --> 01:09:33,50
then blast away several charging zombies. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS603
01:09:30,00 --> 01:09:37,50
The seats launch up the tower then gently drift back down. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS604
01:09:34,00 --> 01:09:39,50
They stop halfway and launch again. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS605
01:09:36,00 --> 01:09:42,50
A crowd of zombies circles the tower base, six bodies deep. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS606
01:09:40,00 --> 01:09:45,50
They uselessly grab at the air. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS607
01:09:46,00 --> 01:09:55,50
As the ride pauses at the top of the tower, SOMEONE and Little SOMEONE's feet dangle over the growing crowd of zombies below. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS608
01:09:52,00 --> 01:10:00,50
As the seats slowly drift back toward the crowd, the crazed zombies reach for the sisters. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS609
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:11,50
SOMEONE fires into the clawing zombie mass. One zombie grabs the metal frame by Little SOMEONE's seat. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS610
01:10:08,00 --> 01:10:16,50
As the ride's base shoots into the air, the zombie plummets, striking the tower on his way down. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS611
01:10:14,00 --> 01:10:19,50
Blood splatters our view. Little SOMEONE faces her sister. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS612
01:10:20,00 --> 01:10:27,50
As the base begins to descend, Little SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare down at the waiting zombies. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS614
01:10:27,00 --> 01:10:32,50
Little SOMEONE hastily aims her rifle and fires. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS615
01:10:31,00 --> 01:10:39,50
The bullet ricochets off the control box. She fires again and blood spews from a zombie's head. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS616
01:10:36,00 --> 01:10:42,50
SOMEONE eyes Little SOMEONE who lets out a breath. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS617
01:10:42,00 --> 01:10:47,50
Sparks fly from the control box. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS618
01:10:45,00 --> 01:10:49,50
The seats stop moving. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS619
01:10:47,00 --> 01:10:52,50
The sisters share a relieved grin. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS620
01:10:50,00 --> 01:10:56,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE pull into the play land parking lot. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS621
01:10:53,00 --> 01:11:01,50
With wide eyes, SOMEONE surveys the swarm of zombies. SOMEONE buckles his seat belt. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS622
01:11:09,00 --> 01:11:14,50
SOMEONE drives toward the park entrance. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS623
01:11:14,00 --> 01:11:20,50
As they speed into the park, a crowd of zombies staggers toward them. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS624
01:11:20,00 --> 01:11:26,50
SOMEONE spins the wheel and fires out his window. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS625
01:11:24,00 --> 01:11:29,50
The zombies convulse as they fall to the ground. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS626
01:11:27,00 --> 01:11:33,50
SOMEONE proudly eyes his smoking gun then reverses the SUV. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS627
01:11:31,00 --> 01:11:37,50
As he spins it around, he runs over two zombie bodies. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS628
01:11:34,00 --> 01:11:41,50
He breaks, backs over the already crushed bodies, then drives forward over them. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS629
01:11:38,00 --> 01:11:44,50
Words appear, Rule Number 2, Double Tap. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS631
01:11:52,00 --> 01:11:58,50
Back on the ride, Little SOMEONE points as she spots the SUV. SOMEONE blinks. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS632
01:11:57,00 --> 01:12:02,50
She stares disbelievingly. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS633
01:11:59,00 --> 01:12:04,50
Little SOMEONE grins. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS634
01:12:01,00 --> 01:12:07,50
On the ground, SOMEONE stops the SUV by the lake. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS635
01:12:04,00 --> 01:12:11,50
SOMEONE jumps out, his shotgun in hand, and jogs to a railing bordering the water. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS636
01:12:08,00 --> 01:12:14,50
He spots the partially submerged yellow Hummer. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS637
01:12:14,00 --> 01:12:18,50
He stares desperately. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS638
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:22,50
Behind him, SOMEONE hefts a bag of weapons onto the hood of the SUV. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS639
01:12:20,00 --> 01:12:25,50
Atop the ride, the sisters wave. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS640
01:12:25,00 --> 01:12:29,50
SOMEONE looks toward the tower. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS641
01:12:28,00 --> 01:12:35,50
He smiles then turns to SOMEONE who wears a tactical vest loaded with weapons. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS642
01:12:38,00 --> 01:12:44,50
SOMEONE raises portable air horn above his head. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS643
01:12:42,00 --> 01:12:47,50
He jogs away from SOMEONE. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS644
01:12:56,00 --> 01:13:01,50
A swarm of zombies chase after him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS645
01:12:59,00 --> 01:13:07,50
From the tower, Little SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch as the zombie crowd below disperses and joins the swarm. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS646
01:13:04,00 --> 01:13:09,50
SOMEONE stops running. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS647
01:13:06,00 --> 01:13:12,50
He tosses aside the air horn and pulls out a machine gun. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS648
01:13:11,00 --> 01:13:17,50
As he mows down a group of zombies, SOMEONE watches. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS649
01:13:16,00 --> 01:13:21,50
A hoard of zombies approach him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS650
01:13:19,00 --> 01:13:23,50
He runs. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS651
01:13:21,00 --> 01:13:28,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE jumps a fence for a ride of swings gliding around in a circle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS652
01:13:26,00 --> 01:13:31,50
He grabs a swing and raises his gun. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS653
01:13:31,00 --> 01:13:45,50
Hanging off the swing by one arm, he shoots the zombies as they approach the fence. SOMEONE glances around frantically as he races from the zombies. He pauses to fire at a group of oncoming attackers. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS654
01:13:43,00 --> 01:13:49,50
He kills one then heads toward the entrance of a haunted house. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS655
01:13:49,00 --> 01:13:57,50
He loads his shotgun as he races down a cave-like passage. A zombie follows close behind. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS656
01:13:54,00 --> 01:14:00,50
A reptilian monster thrusts its head out of the wall, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS657
01:13:57,00 --> 01:14:02,50
catching the zombie between its jaws. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS658
01:13:59,00 --> 01:14:04,50
SOMEONE shoots twice. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS659
01:14:01,00 --> 01:14:07,50
The animatronic monster retracts, taking the zombie with it. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS660
01:14:04,00 --> 01:14:10,50
At the drop ride, zombies climb the tower's frame. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS661
01:14:07,00 --> 01:14:14,50
SOMEONE fires at the closest zombie and sends her sprawling backwards. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS662
01:14:14,00 --> 01:14:19,50
The zombie plummets, splattering blood on the cement. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS663
01:14:16,00 --> 01:14:22,50
A zombie in a track suit closes in on the sisters. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS664
01:14:23,00 --> 01:14:29,50
SOMEONE shoots as he climbs a staircase to a roller coaster platform. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS665
01:14:28,00 --> 01:14:32,50
He shoots a zombie woman in the head. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS666
01:14:30,00 --> 01:14:36,50
As a roller coaster car pulls up beside him, he jumps in. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS667
01:14:33,00 --> 01:14:37,50
The car glides down its track. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS668
01:14:34,00 --> 01:14:40,50
SOMEONE fires his shotgun as he passes zombies. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS669
01:14:40,00 --> 01:14:45,50
A zombie jumps onto the back of the car. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS670
01:14:42,00 --> 01:14:48,50
SOMEONE swivels around and shoots. The zombie falls off. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS671
01:14:45,00 --> 01:14:52,50
The car jerks around a corner where another zombie waits next to the track. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS672
01:14:52,00 --> 01:14:56,50
Blood sprays from the zombie. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS673
01:14:53,00 --> 01:14:59,50
At the haunted house, SOMEONE enters a dusty room. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS674
01:14:56,00 --> 01:15:01,50
He looks around nervously. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS675
01:14:58,00 --> 01:15:03,50
Fake bloody animal carcasses hang from the ceiling. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS676
01:15:04,00 --> 01:15:08,50
A ghost pops out of a closet. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS677
01:15:06,00 --> 01:15:15,50
SOMEONE recoils. Bobbing his head at the sheet covered prop, he passes the closet and heads into a room resembling a dingy cellar. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS678
01:15:13,00 --> 01:15:18,50
A zombie attacks him from behind. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS679
01:15:15,00 --> 01:15:20,50
She wrestles him to the floor. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS680
01:15:17,00 --> 01:15:23,50
As she claws at him, SOMEONE shoots her in the stomach. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS681
01:15:20,00 --> 01:15:26,50
She jerks backwards and he shoots again. She falls on top of him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS682
01:15:24,00 --> 01:15:30,50
At the drop ride, Little SOMEONE fires at the advancing zombies. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS683
01:15:33,00 --> 01:15:40,50
SOMEONE glances at her sister as the blood covered zombie climbs closer. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS684
01:15:37,00 --> 01:15:44,50
Meanwhile, as SOMEONE exits the roller coaster, he shoots an approaching zombie. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS685
01:15:42,00 --> 01:15:51,50
He leaps over the counter of a games hut then slides barred metal gates across the windows. As the hoard of zombies rush closer, 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS686
01:15:48,00 --> 01:15:55,50

He aims one gun out each window at his side. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS689
01:15:59,00 --> 01:16:04,50
Dozens of zombies close in. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS690
01:16:07,00 --> 01:16:12,50
Each of SOMEONE's shots takes out an attacker. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS691
01:16:10,00 --> 01:16:16,50
A couple climb onto the roof and SOMEONE shoots them through the ceiling.

01:16:13,00 --> 01:16:19,50
One zombie breaks the glass of a back door's small window. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS693
01:16:17,00 --> 01:16:29,50
SOMEONE twirls around with both guns. In slow motion, he releases the clips from his guns, turns to the counter behind him, and pounds the handles over new ammo clips. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS694
01:16:26,00 --> 01:16:33,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE races from the haunted house exit with three zombies on his tail. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS695
01:16:30,00 --> 01:16:38,50

01:16:48,00 --> 01:16:54,50
SOMEONE hits the zombie in the track suit with the butt of her rifle. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS701
01:17:01,00 --> 01:17:10,50
He falls. He flails helplessly as he descends. Meanwhile, dead zombie bodies lie in a pile outside the games hut. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS702
01:17:07,00 --> 01:17:13,50
SOMEONE calmly stands inside. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS703
01:17:15,00 --> 01:17:20,50

He slows as he reaches the tower and stares up at the sisters. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS706
01:17:24,00 --> 01:17:29,50
A zombie climbs close to them. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS707
01:17:29,00 --> 01:17:34,50
SOMEONE's mouth drops as he thinks to himself. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS708
01:17:36,00 --> 01:17:41,50

He searches for more shells. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS710
01:17:43,00 --> 01:17:48,50
He tosses down his empty shotgun. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS711
01:17:55,00 --> 01:18:01,50
Rule 17 changes from Don't be a hero to Be a hero. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS712
01:18:00,00 --> 01:18:08,50
The clown grins. SOMEONE notices a giant rubber mallet at a strength testing game. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS713
01:18:06,00 --> 01:18:13,50
He pushes out a breath as he eyes the clown. It rushes him and SOMEONE sprints to the mallet. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS714
01:18:10,00 --> 01:18:14,50
He swings it down into the clown's 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS715
01:18:12,00 --> 01:18:16,50
gut, taking the zombie down. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS716
01:18:13,00 --> 01:18:20,50
SOMEONE raises the mallet once again and smashes the clown's head. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS717
01:18:18,00 --> 01:18:22,50
Blood splatters our view. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS718
01:18:20,00 --> 01:18:24,50
SOMEONE tosses the mallet away. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS719
01:18:22,00 --> 01:18:28,50
Up on the tower, a zombie draws dangerously close to SOMEONE and Little SOMEONE. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS720
01:18:26,00 --> 01:18:32,50
SOMEONE hurries to the ride's control box and presses a button. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS721
01:18:29,00 --> 01:18:34,50
The zombie grabs SOMEONE's leg. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS722
01:18:31,00 --> 01:18:40,50
SOMEONE notices a lever labeled, Emergency Break Release. He lifts it and the seats descend the tower. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS723
01:18:37,00 --> 01:18:41,50
The zombie falls off. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS724
01:18:41,00 --> 01:18:48,50

ZOMBIELAND_DVS725
01:18:54,00 --> 01:18:58,50
SOMEONE hugs him. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS726
01:18:57,00 --> 01:19:02,50
She rests her face on SOMEONE's shoulder. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS727
01:18:59,00 --> 01:19:05,50
As he pulls away, she meets his gaze with a smile. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS728
01:19:02,00 --> 01:19:08,50
She blinks then leans closer, bringing her lips near his ear. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS729
01:19:08,00 --> 01:19:12,50
She draws back. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS730
01:19:09,00 --> 01:19:15,50
SOMEONE tilts his head, his questioning eyes on hers. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS731
01:19:12,00 --> 01:19:16,50
He raises his brow. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS732
01:19:17,00 --> 01:19:25,50
He gently brushes SOMEONE's hair out of her face and pushes it back behind her ear. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS733
01:19:22,00 --> 01:19:29,50
Cupping the back of her neck with his hand, he pulls her in for a kiss. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS734
01:19:32,00 --> 01:19:38,50
As they separate, SOMEONE opens her eyes and gazes at SOMEONE. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS735
01:19:35,00 --> 01:19:40,50
He stares back with a dazed look. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS736
01:19:38,00 --> 01:19:45,50
He swallows then shifts his attention to Little SOMEONE who rolls her eyes. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS737
01:19:45,00 --> 01:19:49,50
SOMEONE and Little SOMEONE exchange a look. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS738
01:19:47,00 --> 01:19:52,50
SOMEONE watches from the roof of the games hut. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS739
01:19:55,00 --> 01:19:59,50
He smiles. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS740
01:19:56,00 --> 01:20:03,50
SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE as they walk side by side through the park. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS741
01:20:00,00 --> 01:20:05,50
She stops abruptly, her eyes narrowing. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS742
01:20:06,00 --> 01:20:12,50
SOMEONE's gaze drifts past a sign for fried Twinkies. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS743
01:20:10,00 --> 01:20:14,50
He strolls toward a snack shop. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS744
01:20:17,00 --> 01:20:23,50
He enters to find SOMEONE destroying the store. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS745
01:20:20,00 --> 01:20:26,50
SOMEONE throws objects at the Twinkie sign. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS746
01:20:24,00 --> 01:20:29,50
He hurls a plastic container against the wall. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS747
01:20:32,00 --> 01:20:36,50
SOMEONE glares. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS749
01:20:35,00 --> 01:20:40,50
SOMEONE fires two shots at a door in the corner. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS750
01:20:37,00 --> 01:20:43,50
He glances at SOMEONE and they cautiously advance. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS751
01:20:41,00 --> 01:20:49,50
Using the end of his gun, SOMEONE pushes open the ajar door and peers into a dark room. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS752
01:20:46,00 --> 01:20:51,50
He turns on the light and jumps back. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS753
01:20:51,00 --> 01:21:01,50
Three rats scamper out of the room. SOMEONE watches as SOMEONE finds a box with a Twinkies label and a hole blown out of its side. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS754
01:21:01,00 --> 01:21:08,50
SOMEONE reaches through the hole and extracts a fistful of crumbled, blown up Twinkie. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS755
01:21:06,00 --> 01:21:10,50
He stares angrily. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS756
01:21:10,00 --> 01:21:14,50
He raises a finger. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS757
01:21:16,00 --> 01:21:21,50

01:21:21,00 --> 01:21:27,50
He rushes outside as SOMEONE drives the SUV away. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS760
01:21:25,00 --> 01:21:30,50
As the vehicle stops, SOMEONE stares desperately. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS761
01:21:46,00 --> 01:21:52,50
Little SOMEONE tosses SOMEONE a wrapped, intact, Twinkie. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS762
01:22:14,00 --> 01:22:21,50
As SOMEONE and SOMEONE head to the SUV, it pulls away then stops. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS763
01:22:27,00 --> 01:22:32,50
As they drive off, SOMEONE takes out a zombie. 

ZOMBIELAND_DVS764
01:22:33,00 --> 01:22:40,50
As the SUV pulls away, our view rises over the sparkling lights of the amusement park.
