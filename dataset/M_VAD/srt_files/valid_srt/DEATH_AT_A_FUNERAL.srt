01:14:02,00 --> 01:14:10,50
In the parlor the brothers struggle unsuccessfully to hold the dwarf and open the coffin at the same time. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS202
01:14:07,00 --> 01:14:13,50
They drop him, then lift the coffin's lid. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS203
01:14:10,00 --> 01:14:14,50
Back in the hallway. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS204
01:14:25,00 --> 01:14:31,50
Meanwhile, the brother's hoist up SOMEONE's limp body again. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS205
01:14:30,00 --> 01:14:37,50
They lay him face down in the casket. His feet on either side of SOMEONE's head. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS206
01:14:35,00 --> 01:14:40,50
SOMEONE regards the arrangement disapprovingly. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS207
01:14:40,00 --> 01:14:46,50
SOMEONE lies with his face buried in SOMEONE's crotch. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS208
01:15:19,00 --> 01:15:25,50
The Reverend tries to sneak past SOMEONE who grabs him. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS209
01:15:26,00 --> 01:15:30,50
In the parlor. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS210
01:15:28,00 --> 01:15:35,50
SOMEONE stares into the coffin where SOMEONE now lies snuggled against SOMEONE. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS211
01:15:32,00 --> 01:15:36,50
On the roof. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS212
01:15:55,00 --> 01:16:00,50
SOMEONE stares at SOMEONE. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS213
01:15:57,00 --> 01:16:02,50
She swallows as she holds his gaze. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS214
01:16:13,00 --> 01:16:18,50
Grinning, SOMEONE hugs her. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS215
01:16:38,00 --> 01:16:43,50
She rushes to the parlor. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS216
01:16:46,00 --> 01:16:53,50
The coffin sits closed behind them. On the roof SOMEONE and SOMEONE kiss. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS217
01:16:52,00 --> 01:17:00,50
SOMEONE slips. He grabs the roofs ledge and hangs in front of a window. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS218
01:17:13,00 --> 01:17:22,50

01:17:22,00 --> 01:17:27,50
SOMEONE rushes up the stairs. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS220
01:17:25,00 --> 01:17:33,50
He barrels into the bathroom door. It bursts open and he finds SOMEONE hanging in front of the window. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS221
01:17:31,00 --> 01:17:35,50
He grabs onto him. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS222
01:17:33,00 --> 01:17:39,50
SOMEONE's crotch presses against SOMEONE's cheek. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS223
01:17:39,00 --> 01:17:45,50
He holds SOMEONE right underneath his buttocks. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS224
01:17:54,00 --> 01:18:03,50
She watches him slip out of view into the house, then collapses tiredly. In the parlor the guests reconvene. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS225
01:18:03,00 --> 01:18:08,50
She eyes him as she sniffs. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS226
01:18:06,00 --> 01:18:10,50
She hurries off. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS228
01:18:19,00 --> 01:18:26,50
With a smirk, SOMEONE nods at his mother. She glances around, then frowns. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS229
01:18:25,00 --> 01:18:29,50
They all look around. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS231
01:18:30,00 --> 01:18:34,50
He eyes her belly. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS232
01:18:34,00 --> 01:18:40,50
Gurgling mouthwash SOMEONE gives a thumbs up. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS233
01:18:37,00 --> 01:18:42,50
As he spits, SOMEONE pats his shoulder.

01:19:01,00 --> 01:19:05,50
In the bedroom SOMEONE pauses. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS239
01:19:03,00 --> 01:19:09,50
He searches his pockets. He flinches as SOMEONE grabs him. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS240
01:19:09,00 --> 01:19:15,50
As he hurries away, SOMEONE leads SOMEONE out of the bathroom. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS241
01:19:43,00 --> 01:19:47,50
They embrace tenderly. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS242
01:19:45,00 --> 01:19:50,50
As they part, SOMEONE hugs SOMEONE. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS243
01:19:48,00 --> 01:19:52,50
He kisses him. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS244
01:19:49,00 --> 01:19:56,50
Downstairs, SOMEONE and SOMEONE rush into the study bathroom. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS245
01:20:14,00 --> 01:20:18,50
In the parlor.

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS250
01:22:11,00 --> 01:22:15,50
SOMEONE stands. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS251
01:22:14,00 --> 01:22:19,50
He buttons his jacket as he faces the room. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS252
01:22:16,00 --> 01:22:22,50
Then reaches into his pocket and pulls out his notes. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS253
01:22:19,00 --> 01:22:24,50
He glances at SOMEONE who nods reassuringly. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS254
01:22:23,00 --> 01:22:28,50
With wide eyes he reads. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS255
01:22:30,00 --> 01:22:36,50
SOMEONE turns his quizzical gaze to the coffin behind him. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS256
01:22:34,00 --> 01:22:39,50
SOMEONE frowns and SOMEONE shifts uneasily. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS257
01:22:41,00 --> 01:22:46,50
The coffin shakes. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS258
01:22:51,00 --> 01:22:56,50
It opens and SOMEONE sits up. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS259
01:22:56,00 --> 01:23:02,50

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS263
01:23:11,00 --> 01:23:18,50
SOMEONE photos fall at SOMEONE's feet as SOMEONE and SOMEONE drag him away. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS264
01:23:18,00 --> 01:23:24,50
SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE fall. SOMEONE picks up the photos. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS265
01:23:23,00 --> 01:23:27,50
She turns to SOMEONE. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS266
01:23:27,00 --> 01:23:31,50
She charges at him. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS267
01:23:28,00 --> 01:23:33,50
Grabbing a guests hat she beats him with it. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS268
01:23:31,00 --> 01:23:39,50
SOMEONE gapes. As SOMEONE and SOMEONE try to restrain SOMEONE she swats them away.

01:25:25,00 --> 01:25:32,50

01:25:30,00 --> 01:25:36,50
He rests his hand on Uncle SOMEONE's shoulder as he passes by. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS273
01:25:35,00 --> 01:25:41,50
He pounds SOMEONE's fist and squeezes his mother's hand. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS274
01:25:38,00 --> 01:25:44,50
Smiling SOMEONE sits up and watches SOMEONE exit. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS275
01:25:41,00 --> 01:25:46,50
SOMEONE pushes him back down. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS276
01:25:43,00 --> 01:25:49,50
Uncle SOMEONE eyes the photo from the Dreamgirls premier. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS277
01:25:49,00 --> 01:25:54,50
He shakes his head pensively. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS279
01:25:53,00 --> 01:26:01,50
Now, SOMEONE strolls downstairs with a suitcase in each hand and sets them by a table in the foyer. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS280
01:25:59,00 --> 01:26:03,50
SOMEONE looks over from the parlor. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS281
01:26:12,00 --> 01:26:16,50
He sits beside SOMEONE. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS282
01:27:07,00 --> 01:27:15,50
SOMEONE opens the front door and finds Martina waiting outside in a red sports car. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS283
01:27:12,00 --> 01:27:16,50
SOMEONE waves. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS284
01:27:19,00 --> 01:27:23,50
SOMEONE strolls over.

SOMEONE and SOMEONE watch from the doorway. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS289
01:27:46,00 --> 01:27:54,50
SOMEONE pauses. Turning, he grins at the couple then gives them a shrug. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS290
01:27:54,00 --> 01:28:02,50
As he hurries to the car Martina smiles. Later, SOMEONE and SOMEONE lounge on a couch. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS291
01:28:08,00 --> 01:28:13,50
She whispers into his ear. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS292
01:28:13,00 --> 01:28:17,50
They kiss. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS293
01:28:26,00 --> 01:28:32,50
Grinning, SOMEONE returns his wife's kisses, then pulls away. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS294
01:28:30,00 --> 01:28:34,50
On the roof. 

DEATH_AT_A_FUNERAL_DVS295
01:28:32,00 --> 01:28:38,50
Uncle SOMEONE sits naked above the bathroom window.
