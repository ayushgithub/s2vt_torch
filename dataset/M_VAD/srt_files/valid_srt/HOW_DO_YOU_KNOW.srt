HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS31
00:03:05,00 --> 00:03:11,50
Moving to the door, she looks at the head coach and grins. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS32
00:03:11,00 --> 00:03:16,50
She steps out to meet SOMEONE in the hall. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS33
00:03:17,00 --> 00:03:23,50
The bitter assistant coach shares a warm hug with her player. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS34
00:03:20,00 --> 00:03:26,50
Now as we rove over a river toward a city, words appear. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS35
00:03:23,00 --> 00:03:28,50
Arlington, Virginia a few days later. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS36
00:03:26,00 --> 00:03:30,50
At a softball practice. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS37
00:03:30,00 --> 00:03:37,50
Teammates throw balls to SOMEONE who drops them in a bucket beside third base. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS38
00:03:36,00 --> 00:03:41,50
A cellphone rings inside an open duffel bag. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS39
00:03:42,00 --> 00:03:47,50
As SOMEONE looks over, a ball hits her in the face. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS40
00:03:51,00 --> 00:03:56,50
Her mouth bloodied, she answers the phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS41
00:04:26,00 --> 00:04:32,50
A woman in a skirt suit barges into SOMEONE's office with a letter. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS42
00:04:39,00 --> 00:04:43,50
He accepts the letter. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS43
00:05:10,00 --> 00:05:21,50
In the office, the boyish businessman opens his letter to find a subpoena for a wire fraud case which reads, United States of America v. SOMEONE Madison. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS44
00:05:21,00 --> 00:05:25,50
Now SOMEONE eats with a friend. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS45
00:05:49,00 --> 00:05:53,50
Now in a classroom. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS46
00:05:54,00 --> 00:06:01,50
The professor steps out to find the businessman texting in the hallway. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS47
00:06:07,00 --> 00:06:11,50
In her office. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS49
00:06:48,00 --> 00:06:54,50
SOMEONE exits the club with a blond man who stops to sign autographs. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS50
00:06:58,00 --> 00:07:03,50
His date continues walking down the alley. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS51
00:07:00,00 --> 00:07:04,50
She turns back. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS52
00:07:03,00 --> 00:07:08,50
He points her around a corner, then runs after her grinning. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS53
00:07:10,00 --> 00:07:16,50
SOMEONE rounds the corner, grabs Lisa, and lifts her off of her feet. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS54
00:07:42,00 --> 00:07:46,50
He backs away from her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS55
00:07:49,00 --> 00:07:53,50
She nods. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS56
00:07:50,00 --> 00:07:58,50
The gray haired doorman glances at SOMEONE, then takes three steps back to patiently stand beside him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS57
00:07:59,00 --> 00:08:05,50
SOMEONE glances at each of them, then throws up her arms and starts inside. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS58
00:08:08,00 --> 00:08:12,50
She punches his stomach. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS59
00:08:11,00 --> 00:08:19,50
The next morning, in a well-furnished bedroom with an adjoining balcony, SOMEONE lies alone in bed. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS60
00:08:19,00 --> 00:08:26,50
She sits up and peers across the room, then grabs her slip from a nightstand. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS61
00:08:33,00 --> 00:08:40,50
He sets two frothy, white blender drinks on a ledge, opens a window, and shakes his head. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS62
00:08:42,00 --> 00:08:46,50
He hops on the bed. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS63
00:09:12,00 --> 00:09:21,50
He hands SOMEONE one of the drinks. She eyes its garnishment of fruit and a blue plastic star, then takes a sip. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS64
00:09:40,00 --> 00:09:43,50
She sets it down. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS65
00:09:42,00 --> 00:09:46,50
She grabs her dress and steps out. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS66
00:09:49,00 --> 00:09:56,50
SOMEONE looks around the huge bathroom, which leads to a massive walk-in closet. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS67
00:09:59,00 --> 00:10:06,50
She opens the drawer and finds it filled with unopened toothbrushes of every color and pattern. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS68
00:10:03,00 --> 00:10:07,50
SOMEONE enters. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS69
00:10:04,00 --> 00:10:11,50
SOMEONE takes a brush, then puts her bright red dress on over her matching slip. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS70
00:10:15,00 --> 00:10:21,50
He opens a cabinet filled with women's pink sweat suits. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS71
00:10:21,00 --> 00:10:26,50
Size stickers SOMEONE a stack of sweatshirts. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS72
00:10:38,00 --> 00:10:41,50
She heads out. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS73
00:11:13,00 --> 00:11:22,50
He watches her head out the front door. She starts to pull it shut behind her, then stops and reenters the apartment. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS74
00:11:24,00 --> 00:11:31,50
She storms back down the hallway and returns to the bedroom where SOMEONE sits on his bed. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS75
00:11:55,00 --> 00:11:59,50
He beams. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS76
00:12:30,00 --> 00:12:35,50
With a smile, she leans in. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS77
00:12:38,00 --> 00:12:45,50
Now SOMEONE strolls down a sidewalk in her rumpled red dress, passing another pedestrian. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS78
00:12:43,00 --> 00:12:48,50
A breeze rustles the green leaves of a bush nearby. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS79
00:12:45,00 --> 00:12:54,50
SOMEONE crosses a street, then reaches into her purse as she approaches the front door of a columned apartment building. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS80
00:12:51,00 --> 00:12:56,50
Later inside, she sits at a laptop. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS81
00:12:54,00 --> 00:13:01,50
A USA softball website reads, Announcement of 2011 Team USA. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS82
00:12:59,00 --> 00:13:06,50
SOMEONE clicks on the link and a notice appears, Selection of next year's team delayed. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS83
00:13:04,00 --> 00:13:09,50
SOMEONE deflates, then leaves the laptop. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS84
00:13:06,00 --> 00:13:11,50
Now pedestrians walk past an office building. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS85
00:13:12,00 --> 00:13:19,50
Inside, SOMEONE finds a bespectacled man drying his hands in a men's room. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS86
00:13:17,00 --> 00:13:21,50
He hands him the subpoena. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS87
00:13:20,00 --> 00:13:26,50
The bespectacled man finishes drying a hand, then reads. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS88
00:13:43,00 --> 00:13:47,50
The man's eyes widen. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS89
00:13:52,00 --> 00:13:57,50
He braces himself and takes a breath. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS90
00:13:54,00 --> 00:13:58,50
In SOMEONE's office. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS91
00:13:57,00 --> 00:14:03,50
A bespectacled man with thinning gray hair kisses him on the cheek. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS92
00:14:05,00 --> 00:14:09,50
SOMEONE hands him the subpoena. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS93
00:14:06,00 --> 00:14:12,50
The lawyer peers closely over his shoulder to read along. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS94
00:14:37,00 --> 00:14:42,50
SOMEONE picks up his phone receiver and dials. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS95
00:14:44,00 --> 00:14:49,50
A pregnant, auburn haired woman enters. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS97
00:16:44,00 --> 00:16:50,50
SOMEONE furiously leaps up to punch him from behind, but SOMEONE stops her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS98
00:17:20,00 --> 00:17:25,50
Ron sits with SOMEONE and dictates to her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS99
00:17:36,00 --> 00:17:44,50
As SOMEONE exits the office, SOMEONE notes his dejected expression. Outside, SOMEONE crosses the street. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS100
00:17:42,00 --> 00:17:47,50
He stops and presses a hand to his forehead. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS102
00:17:53,00 --> 00:17:59,50
Glancing out a window, Ron spots SOMEONE sulking across the street. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS103
00:17:57,00 --> 00:18:04,50
Rising from the table, he faces the window and takes out his cell. He makes a call. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS104
00:18:04,00 --> 00:18:11,50
Outside, SOMEONE fishes his phone from his pocket and answers. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS105
00:18:35,00 --> 00:18:40,50
SOMEONE stares up at the fourth floor office window. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS106
00:18:48,00 --> 00:18:54,50
Ron hangs up, leaving SOMEONE staring up at him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS107
00:18:51,00 --> 00:18:56,50
Later in an apartment, SOMEONE makes a call. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS108
00:19:05,00 --> 00:19:10,50
His girlfriend eyes him from behind a desk. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS109
00:19:18,00 --> 00:19:21,50
He hangs up. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS111
00:19:35,00 --> 00:19:38,50
She rises. She moves to SOMEONE. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS112
00:19:37,00 --> 00:19:44,50
She moves to SOMEONE and squats in front of him, resting her hands on his knees. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS113
00:19:46,00 --> 00:19:50,50
She briefly rubs his legs. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS114
00:20:23,00 --> 00:20:28,50
Gaping, SOMEONE leaves. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS115
00:20:25,00 --> 00:20:33,50
Later, he grills a steak on a patio balcony, his tie discarded and his shirt untucked. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS116
00:20:30,00 --> 00:20:38,50
He sprinkles seasoning on the meat, his hand jerking the container more and more aggressively as he loses composure. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS117
00:20:38,00 --> 00:20:46,50
Stabbing a fork into the steak, he flips it repeatedly, then suddenly hurls it off the balcony. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS118
00:20:46,00 --> 00:20:53,50
Now inside, he pours vodka into a shot glass and eyeballs it. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS119
00:20:51,00 --> 00:20:59,50
He pours half of the glass back into the bottle, then empties the remainder into a cocktail shaker. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS120
00:20:56,00 --> 00:21:04,50
He adds a spoonful of horseradish, some Worcestershire sauce and tomato juice, then shakes it all up. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS121
00:21:03,00 --> 00:21:10,50
With a celery stalk, he stirs his glass of Bloody Mary, then takes a sip. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS122
00:21:09,00 --> 00:21:15,50
Later, SOMEONE fills his empty glass with more Bloody SOMEONE. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS123
00:21:13,00 --> 00:21:20,50
The image dissolves to him clumsily refilling the glass with straight vodka. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS124
00:21:19,00 --> 00:21:23,50
Now he points a remote control. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS125
00:21:32,00 --> 00:21:36,50
He sings into a lamp like a microphone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS126
00:21:54,00 --> 00:21:58,50
He grabs another drink. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS127
00:22:04,00 --> 00:22:10,50
Now in the bathroom, SOMEONE urinates. He grabs his phone with his free hand. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS128
00:22:22,00 --> 00:22:26,50
SOMEONE muffles his phone inside a towel. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS129
00:22:24,00 --> 00:22:29,50
Holding it away from the toilet, he flushes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS130
00:22:27,00 --> 00:22:31,50
He rinses his hand. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS131
00:22:41,00 --> 00:22:46,50
She lifts her shirt and pats her enormous belly. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS132
00:22:49,00 --> 00:22:55,50
Heading down a staircase, SOMEONE trips and slides to the bottom on his back. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS133
00:22:56,00 --> 00:23:01,50
With a grin, he rises, unharmed. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS134
00:23:40,00 --> 00:23:46,50
Hanging her head, SOMEONE squeezes her eyes shut. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS135
00:23:43,00 --> 00:23:47,50
They tear up as she opens them. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS136
00:24:28,00 --> 00:24:32,50
With a furrowed brow, SOMEONE hangs up. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS137
00:24:30,00 --> 00:24:37,50
He briefly presses his fingers to his forehead, then leans back in his chair. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS138
00:24:35,00 --> 00:24:41,50
Rising, he straightens his T-shirt as he trudges out of his living room. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS139
00:24:38,00 --> 00:24:44,50
He pauses, opens his phone, and makes a call. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS140
00:24:41,00 --> 00:24:46,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE rides on a bus. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS141
00:24:46,00 --> 00:24:51,50
She pulls her phone from her bag and answers. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS142
00:24:56,00 --> 00:25:00,50
SOMEONE frowns uncertainly. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS143
00:25:24,00 --> 00:25:29,50
SOMEONE leans on a wall and slips. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS144
00:25:44,00 --> 00:25:49,50
He lowers his phone and folds it shut. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS145
00:25:46,00 --> 00:25:53,50
The next morning, two women stroll across the street in front of SOMEONE's apartment building. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS146
00:25:50,00 --> 00:25:55,50
Inside, she lies asleep in bed. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS147
00:25:57,00 --> 00:26:02,50
She bolts awake and glances around. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS148
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:08,50
As she throws back her covers, her legs get tangled in the sheets and she wrestles them off. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS149
00:26:05,00 --> 00:26:10,50
She strides to a table and grabs her phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS150
00:26:07,00 --> 00:26:13,50
Its display reads, Missed call Coach SOMEONE. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS151
00:26:10,00 --> 00:26:16,50
Frowning, SOMEONE runs a hand through her mussed hair. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS152
00:26:13,00 --> 00:26:22,50
She turns to her computer, which displays the softball team website, and clicks on the link for the announcement of the 2011 team. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS153
00:26:20,00 --> 00:26:24,50
A window appears. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS154
00:26:21,00 --> 00:26:25,50
Click to see next year's lineup. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS155
00:26:27,00 --> 00:26:35,50
SOMEONE shifts her gaze to her phone, then picks it up and reads a text message from Riva, I'm coming over. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS156
00:26:34,00 --> 00:26:41,50
Setting the phone back down, she sits at her laptop and types frantically. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS157
00:26:39,00 --> 00:26:45,50
She scrolls through the team lineup, but doesn't find her name. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS158
00:26:42,00 --> 00:26:48,50
A blue asterisk blinks on the roster, indicating a new player. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS159
00:26:45,00 --> 00:26:51,50
The position reads, Cam Austin, second base. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS160
00:26:48,00 --> 00:26:52,50
SOMEONE drops her head. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS161
00:26:51,00 --> 00:26:56,50
Pressing her lips together, she closes her eyes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS162
00:26:54,00 --> 00:27:00,50
She lifts her gaze back to the laptop and stares at it. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS163
00:26:57,00 --> 00:27:02,50
Her chest heaving then closes her eyes again. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS164
00:27:02,00 --> 00:27:09,50
She reopens them and stares at the blue asterisk, blinking beside her replacement's name. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS167
00:27:10,00 --> 00:27:20,50
Now in her bathroom. SOMEONE grabs her electric toothbrush. The mirror is covered in inspirational quotes written on sticky notes, including, Obstacles are what you see when you lose sight of your goal. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS168
00:27:18,00 --> 00:27:23,50
Blinking rapidly, SOMEONE starts to brush her teeth. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS169
00:27:24,00 --> 00:27:32,50
As her gaze scans the brightly colored notes, she stops brushing and closes her lips around her toothbrush. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS170
00:27:31,00 --> 00:27:36,50
With sad eyes, she resumes brushing. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS171
00:27:35,00 --> 00:27:41,50
She closes her eyes and tears slide down her cheeks. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS172
00:27:38,00 --> 00:27:44,50
As her face crumples, she lowers her toothbrush from her mouth. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS173
00:27:41,00 --> 00:27:46,50
Her hand dropping heavily on the counter. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS174
00:27:44,00 --> 00:27:48,50
Her mouth trembles. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS175
00:27:45,00 --> 00:27:50,50
A froth of toothpaste clinging to her lower lip. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS176
00:27:49,00 --> 00:27:56,50
She reads two quotes; Courage is mastery of fear, not absence of fear. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS177
00:27:53,00 --> 00:27:58,50
Don't judge anybody before you check yourself out. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS178
00:27:56,00 --> 00:28:01,50
You're lucky when it's your fault, because you can correct the situation. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS180
00:28:05,00 --> 00:28:09,50
Her expression hardens. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS181
00:28:10,00 --> 00:28:16,50
She leans over the sink. Eyeing her reflection, she wipes her mouth, then heads off. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS182
00:28:16,00 --> 00:28:21,50
Now SOMEONE leaves his building. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS183
00:29:03,00 --> 00:29:07,50
SOMEONE sprints away. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS184
00:29:05,00 --> 00:29:10,50
In his suit and dress shoes. SOMEONE blinks and stares. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS185
00:29:07,00 --> 00:29:13,50
Now SOMEONE dons a skirt as her teammates visit. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS186
00:29:31,00 --> 00:29:35,50
She heads for the door. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS187
00:30:19,00 --> 00:30:24,50
Now SOMEONE marches down a city street. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS188
00:30:22,00 --> 00:30:30,50
Pausing at a corner, she wipes a tear, ruefully checks her fingers for runny makeup and rolls her eyes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS189
00:30:29,00 --> 00:30:35,50
Now at an elegant restaurant, she approaches a well-dressed Maître d'. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS190
00:30:40,00 --> 00:30:47,50
The Maître d' leads her onto a balcony and gestures down toward a solitary figure at a table. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS191
00:30:48,00 --> 00:30:53,50
SOMEONE sits slumped, his head in his hands. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS192
00:30:54,00 --> 00:30:58,50
The grinning Maître d' leads on. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS193
00:30:58,00 --> 00:31:03,50
He obligingly excuses himself. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS194
00:31:00,00 --> 00:31:06,50
Heading along the balcony, SOMEONE regards her date uncertainly. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS195
00:31:03,00 --> 00:31:08,50
Now she arrives at his table. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS196
00:31:06,00 --> 00:31:10,50
He looks up pitiably. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS197
00:31:09,00 --> 00:31:13,50
He springs to his feet. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS198
00:31:14,00 --> 00:31:19,50
SOMEONE slips into the high-backed booth. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS199
00:31:20,00 --> 00:31:25,50
SOMEONE shrugs her brow and frowns. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS200
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:33,50
SOMEONE's eyes narrow. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS201
00:31:52,00 --> 00:31:57,50
SOMEONE picks up her menu and SOMEONE nods. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS202
00:32:12,00 --> 00:32:18,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes, then studies her menu. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS203
00:33:04,00 --> 00:33:08,50
SOMEONE stares helplessly at her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS204
00:33:32,00 --> 00:33:37,50
Smiling, SOMEONE stares at her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS205
00:33:34,00 --> 00:33:40,50
His eyes twinkle and he gives a stunned shake of the head. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS206
00:33:37,00 --> 00:33:43,50
He amiably shuts his mouth and faces his menu. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS207
00:33:40,00 --> 00:33:47,50
SOMEONE fidgets her fingers, allows a small half-smile, and nods. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS208
00:33:44,00 --> 00:33:49,50
Later, they dine on spaghetti and meatballs. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS209
00:33:47,00 --> 00:33:52,50
SOMEONE cuts a chunk of tomato and eats it. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS210
00:33:49,00 --> 00:33:54,50
SOMEONE sneaks glances at her as he chews. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS211
00:33:52,00 --> 00:33:58,50
His date shifts her worried gaze, occasionally eyeing him impassively. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS212
00:33:56,00 --> 00:34:01,50
Her features contorting in a pensive frown. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS213
00:33:59,00 --> 00:34:04,50
SOMEONE stops eating and leans back in her seat. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS214
00:34:10,00 --> 00:34:16,50
Her lips part and her stubborn chin juts forward. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS215
00:34:13,00 --> 00:34:18,50
SOMEONE studies her intently. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS216
00:34:16,00 --> 00:34:20,50
His brow lifts and he stops chewing. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS217
00:34:18,00 --> 00:34:22,50
Catching him staring, SOMEONE gives a nervous half-smile and looks down. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS219
00:34:22,00 --> 00:34:27,50
SOMEONE's lips curl into a dreamy-eyed smile. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS221
00:34:26,00 --> 00:34:33,50
He opens the restaurant door for SOMEONE and follows her out with a goofy grin. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS222
00:34:35,00 --> 00:34:40,50
He shrugs and beams at her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS223
00:34:40,00 --> 00:34:44,50
SOMEONE creases her lips, sizing him up. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS224
00:34:43,00 --> 00:34:48,50
SOMEONE watches her go with his boyish grin. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS225
00:34:46,00 --> 00:34:52,50
Now SOMEONE uses his cellphone as he leaves his building. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS226
00:34:58,00 --> 00:35:01,50
In a bar, SOMEONE talks on the phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS227
00:35:08,00 --> 00:35:13,50
SOMEONE faces SOMEONE, the doorman. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS228
00:35:14,00 --> 00:35:20,50
The doorman chuckles, points, and steps away. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS229
00:35:32,00 --> 00:35:37,50
Now SOMEONE plods up a flight of stairs. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS230
00:35:34,00 --> 00:35:47,50
Entering her apartment, she finds a bouquet of flowers with an attached construction paper card, reading, We love you, Smalls. Dozens of other notes surround the gift, and SOMEONE sits behind the display. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS231
00:36:10,00 --> 00:36:14,50
Now in SOMEONE's apartment. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS232
00:36:14,00 --> 00:36:18,50
He crosses to the door. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS233
00:36:27,00 --> 00:36:33,50
SOMEONE sulks into the living room. She halts abruptly and looks around. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS234
00:37:00,00 --> 00:37:04,50
He leads her to a couch. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS235
00:37:05,00 --> 00:37:11,50
As she sits, he lies down and puts his head in her lap. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS236
00:37:08,00 --> 00:37:14,50
SOMEONE squirms an arm out from under his shoulder and sets her bag on the floor. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS237
00:37:18,00 --> 00:37:26,50
Daytime. SOMEONE ushers SOMEONE through a dignified office building's thriving lobby. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS238
00:37:23,00 --> 00:37:30,50
Reaching a reception desk, they peer at a vast wall mounted directory. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS239
00:37:31,00 --> 00:37:37,50
SOMEONE brushes off his son's suit jacket as he guides him along. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS240
00:37:34,00 --> 00:37:45,50
Now they sit side-by-side on a waiting room couch, both resting their hands on their parted knees and drumming their fingers. Later, SOMEONE faces a bearded man. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS241
00:38:05,00 --> 00:38:10,50
SOMEONE's head droops forward and he bites his upper lip. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS242
00:38:12,00 --> 00:38:19,50
Now SOMEONE arrives in a tasteful office where a man with a closely trimmed beard waits at a desk. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS243
00:38:29,00 --> 00:38:34,50
He gestures to a SOMEONE to sit on chair or ottoman. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS245
00:38:32,00 --> 00:38:37,50
SOMEONE perches on the ottoman. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS246
00:38:34,00 --> 00:38:38,50
As he takes a seat facing her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS247
00:38:37,00 --> 00:38:42,50
The kind-faced man crosses his legs. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS248
00:38:52,00 --> 00:38:57,50
The psychiatrist patiently lifts his chin. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS249
00:39:43,00 --> 00:39:50,50
Narrowing her eyes, SOMEONE gives an appreciative nod and starts to leave. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS250
00:39:48,00 --> 00:39:52,50
She halts in the doorway and turns around. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS251
00:40:13,00 --> 00:40:18,50
SOMEONE leaves then reappears in his doorway. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS253
00:40:19,00 --> 00:40:25,50
As rain pours, party guests in summery clothes crowd a home. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS254
00:40:22,00 --> 00:40:29,50
SOMEONE gets food at a buffet while SOMEONE waits on a covered terrace. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS255
00:40:26,00 --> 00:40:34,50
Seeing her through a window he notices her watching the man beside him fondling a woman's breast. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS256
00:40:32,00 --> 00:40:38,50
SOMEONE pulls the man's hand down and directs their attention to SOMEONE. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS257
00:40:35,00 --> 00:40:41,50
The woman scowls and puts her date's hand back on her breast. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS258
00:40:38,00 --> 00:40:43,50
SOMEONE brings SOMEONE food. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS259
00:41:09,00 --> 00:41:14,50
SOMEONE glances toward the partiers inside. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS260
00:41:29,00 --> 00:41:35,50
SOMEONE shifts in his seat and gives a sheepishly obliging shrug. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS261
00:42:09,00 --> 00:42:14,50
SOMEONE gives a meek, pleased smile. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS262
00:42:13,00 --> 00:42:20,50
Now a bird's eye view shows an umbrella only half sheltering SOMEONE's plate of BBQ. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS263
00:42:17,00 --> 00:42:22,50
He and SOMEONE share the umbrella. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS264
00:42:19,00 --> 00:42:25,50
SOMEONE sadly throws the plate in a trash bin. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS265
00:42:23,00 --> 00:42:27,50
Later at his place. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS266
00:42:53,00 --> 00:42:58,50
He grins and SOMEONE gives him an irritated look. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS267
00:43:04,00 --> 00:43:09,50
Standing behind her he wraps his arms around her waist. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS268
00:43:20,00 --> 00:43:23,50
SOMEONE nods. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS269
00:43:26,00 --> 00:43:30,50
He pours Cheerios. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS270
00:43:36,00 --> 00:43:41,50
He adds Life cereal to their bowls 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS271
00:43:47,00 --> 00:43:53,50
SOMEONE gives him a nod. SOMEONE pours blueberries over their cereal. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS272
00:44:17,00 --> 00:44:21,50
SOMEONE gives her a bowl. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS273
00:44:37,00 --> 00:44:45,50
With a mouthful of cereal, SOMEONE shifts her thoughtful eyes. She gives SOMEONE an expectant look. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS274
00:44:58,00 --> 00:45:02,50
SOMEONE shakes his head. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS275
00:45:23,00 --> 00:45:27,50
He slaps her shoulder. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS276
00:45:25,00 --> 00:45:31,50
As he starts to eat his cereal, SOMEONE gives him an appreciative look. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS277
00:45:31,00 --> 00:45:36,50
SOMEONE stops eating and looks over with wide eyes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS278
00:45:35,00 --> 00:45:41,50
He gives a disturbed look and she playfully punches his arm. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS279
00:45:40,00 --> 00:45:48,50
Now our view tilts up from the lobby doors past the engraved entablature just below the second story. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS280
00:45:46,00 --> 00:45:49,50
Bowlen building. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS281
00:45:48,00 --> 00:45:53,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE lie with their heads at the foot of his bed. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS282
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:05,50
SOMEONE claps and the lights turn on. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS283
00:46:21,00 --> 00:46:25,50
She points at him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS284
00:46:41,00 --> 00:46:48,50
As he leans over her, she punches his shoulder twice. The lights turn off. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS285
00:46:54,00 --> 00:47:01,50
On another day, SOMEONE sits on the bench in the National's bullpen smiling to himself. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS286
00:47:01,00 --> 00:47:06,50
He stares off dreamily. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS287
00:47:04,00 --> 00:47:09,50
He blinks himself out of his reverie. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS288
00:47:06,00 --> 00:47:11,50
An opposing player rounds third toward home plate. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS289
00:47:09,00 --> 00:47:15,50
A National's outfielder makes an amazing catch, right over the wall of the bullpen. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS290
00:47:17,00 --> 00:47:22,50
His teammates swivel their heads toward him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS291
00:47:23,00 --> 00:47:28,50
Shrugging his hands a ball player rises. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS292
00:47:32,00 --> 00:47:36,50
Starting his warm-up he catches a ball. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS293
00:47:39,00 --> 00:47:44,50
SOMEONE catches the ball again, then leans toward him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS294
00:47:46,00 --> 00:47:50,50
SOMEONE's shoulders heave. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS295
00:47:52,00 --> 00:47:59,50
Later in the National's training room, SOMEONE holds his phone to his ear as he runs in a pool treadmill. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS296
00:47:58,00 --> 00:48:04,50
In her apartment, SOMEONE removes the bag from the trashcan. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS297
00:48:02,00 --> 00:48:07,50
She lets the can fall as she goes to the phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS298
00:48:13,00 --> 00:48:17,50
SOMEONE's jaw drops. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS299
00:48:31,00 --> 00:48:38,50
Hanging up, SOMEONE glances around, then returns her attention to the trash bag. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS300
00:48:40,00 --> 00:48:44,50
Grinning she flips open her phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS301
00:48:47,00 --> 00:48:51,50
A trainer brings him ice. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS302
00:49:28,00 --> 00:49:33,50
SOMEONE's mouth lifts into a crooked SOMEONE. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS303
00:49:43,00 --> 00:49:47,50
SOMEONE shifts her eyes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS304
00:50:15,00 --> 00:50:20,50
With a thoughtful look, SOMEONE hangs up. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS305
00:50:17,00 --> 00:50:22,50
Now she packs a duffel bag in her room. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS306
00:50:19,00 --> 00:50:23,50
SOMEONE shakes her head. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS307
00:50:46,00 --> 00:50:52,50
The assistant coach rises from the arm of a sofa and hugs her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS308
00:51:03,00 --> 00:51:07,50
SOMEONE answers his front door. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS309
00:51:07,00 --> 00:51:13,50
She indicates a large stack of bags and suitcases. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS310
00:51:12,00 --> 00:51:18,50
In his closet, SOMEONE opens a drawer that's only one third empty. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS311
00:51:26,00 --> 00:51:31,50
She nods and they share a smile. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS312
00:51:28,00 --> 00:51:33,50
Glancing back at the drawer she shrugs. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS313
00:51:31,00 --> 00:51:35,50
Now at an apartment above a bakery. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS314
00:51:35,00 --> 00:51:43,50
SOMEONE rises from a desk at a bay window. Boxes and other packed items line his small living room and hallway. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS315
00:51:40,00 --> 00:51:44,50
He opens the door. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS316
00:51:47,00 --> 00:51:51,50
SOMEONE carries in a grocery bag. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS317
00:52:11,00 --> 00:52:16,50
SOMEONE loads the fridge. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS318
00:52:17,00 --> 00:52:22,50
SOMEONE waddles to an armchair and sinks down in it. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS319
00:52:34,00 --> 00:52:38,50
She stands. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS320
00:53:49,00 --> 00:53:56,50
Standing in front of him, SOMEONE bites her lip and eyes him skeptically. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS321
00:53:54,00 --> 00:53:59,50
She takes a few steps away and gives him a sidelong look. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS322
00:53:58,00 --> 00:54:03,50
With her thoughtful gaze still locked on his face 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS323
00:54:00,00 --> 00:54:05,50
she cocks her heads and studies him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS324
00:54:07,00 --> 00:54:11,50
She sets her hands on her hips. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS325
00:54:25,00 --> 00:54:31,50
She juts out her jaw, then curls her lips together. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS326
00:54:28,00 --> 00:54:33,50
SOMEONE stands ready to exit his apartment. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS327
00:54:34,00 --> 00:54:38,50
She heads to the kitchen. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS329
00:54:42,00 --> 00:54:47,50
SOMEONE approaches the Bowlen Building. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS330
00:54:44,00 --> 00:54:49,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE makes a call from the desk in his study. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS331
00:54:55,00 --> 00:54:59,50
SOMEONE stops in the lobby. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS332

SOMEONE closes his eyes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS333
00:55:26,00 --> 00:55:34,50
He shuts his phone then letting his upper body go limp, slams his head onto a decorative table and holds it there. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS334
00:55:34,00 --> 00:55:39,50

Entering, SOMEONE frowns at seeing SOMEONE.

00:57:24,00 --> 00:57:30,50
SOMEONE gives a comprehending nod, then smiles at him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS347
00:57:28,00 --> 00:57:33,50
SOMEONE wears a disgruntled look. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS348
00:57:43,00 --> 00:57:50,50
Smiling tightly, she jerks her to the side, then moves off. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS349
00:57:47,00 --> 00:57:52,50
SOMEONE follows with a long sigh. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS350
00:57:49,00 --> 00:57:54,50
SOMEONE peers after them as they enter another room. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS351
00:58:21,00 --> 00:58:26,50
SOMEONE stares with disbelieving eyes. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS352
00:58:25,00 --> 00:58:29,50
She blinks up at him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS353
00:58:33,00 --> 00:58:39,50
Following her into the hall, he glances at George, who looks away.

00:58:36,00 --> 00:58:41,50
Now SOMEONE packs. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS355
00:58:59,00 --> 00:59:06,50
SOMEONE opens the front door and SOMEONE stalks to the elevator with her bags and suitcases in tow.

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS359
00:59:22,00 --> 00:59:28,50
In the lobby, the doorman rushes to keep ahead of SOMEONE and opens the door for her.

He and SOMEONE start off down the street. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS367
01:00:12,00 --> 01:00:18,50
As they head to a bus stop, the doorman answers an intercom phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS368
01:00:21,00 --> 01:00:29,50
He sets down the phone receiver and jogs toward George, who waits behind SOMEONE a short distance away. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS369
01:00:26,00 --> 01:00:31,50
As the doorman opens his mouth to call him 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS370
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:36,50
he notices SOMEONE shaking his head giddily then looking skyward with a grateful smile.

01:00:33,00 --> 01:00:39,50
Grinning sympathetically, SOMEONE returns to the intercom.

He watches as SOMEONE follows SOMEONE on to a bus, hauling up her roller bag. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS373
01:00:49,00 --> 01:00:59,50
Later at his downsized apartment, SOMEONE helps SOMEONE carry in her luggage. She sets down her bags, then takes out her cellphone and charger. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS374
01:01:00,00 --> 01:01:04,50
She notes SOMEONE's boxes.

He checks his cell and ignores a call from dad. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS377
01:01:34,00 --> 01:01:38,50
He enters the kitchen. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS378
01:01:41,00 --> 01:01:48,50
She opens his fridge, finding the vast array of neatly labeled homemade items. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS379
01:01:53,00 --> 01:01:59,50
As SOMEONE sets his jacket down she joins him at the counter and grabs a fork.

01:01:59,00 --> 01:02:07,50
SOMEONE leaves the galley kitchen and unplugs her cellphone from its charger. She steps aside.

01:02:17,00 --> 01:02:20,50
He peeks at her. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS382
01:02:19,00 --> 01:02:25,50
Rolling up his sleeves, he smirks. She faces him. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS383
01:02:29,00 --> 01:02:34,50
She tosses down her phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS384
01:02:51,00 --> 01:02:55,50
SOMEONE considers the idea. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS385
01:03:02,00 --> 01:03:06,50
She frowns. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS386
01:03:20,00 --> 01:03:24,50
He crosses to the door. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS387
01:03:42,00 --> 01:03:46,50
SOMEONE deflates. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS388
01:03:46,00 --> 01:03:54,50
Left alone in the cluttered second floor apartment she glances around and wanders over to a bay window. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS389
01:03:52,00 --> 01:04:00,50
Peering outside she spots SOMEONE who holds up a six-pack of Guinness on his way back across the 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS390
01:04:02,00 --> 01:04:06,50
He runs in front of an oncoming car. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS391
01:04:04,00 --> 01:04:09,50
He barely avoids getting hit. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS392
01:04:08,00 --> 01:04:12,50
SOMEONE shakes her head and leaves the window. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS393
01:04:12,00 --> 01:04:15,50
Now on the phone. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS394
01:04:32,00 --> 01:04:37,50
SOMEONE slides open his cellphone and aims it at his sad face. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS395
01:04:38,00 --> 01:04:43,50
He checks the pic, then sets up a second shot. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS396
01:04:43,00 --> 01:04:49,50
He tilts his head and milks the pout a little more. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS397
01:04:47,00 --> 01:04:58,50
Now SOMEONE adds three dashes of bitters to highball glass, drops in a single sugar cube and measures some Maker's SOMEONE in a metal shot cup. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS398
01:04:55,00 --> 01:05:02,50
In the living room, SOMEONE grabs her near-empty glass of Guinness and takes a sip.

She accepts the cloudy, peach tinted beverage. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS405
01:05:42,00 --> 01:05:46,50
SOMEONE sits across from her on the floor.

She unplugs her cellphone and 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS424
01:11:07,00 --> 01:11:12,50
flips it open to check the caller ID. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS425
01:11:30,00 --> 01:11:34,50
He finds a scrap of paper. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS426
01:11:45,00 --> 01:11:51,50
His note reads, I went nuts when you left, I broke a lamp.

Later on the street. SOMEONE raises his arm for a taxi. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS432
01:12:45,00 --> 01:12:51,50
He smiles warmly, then resumes trying for a cab. 

HOW_DO_YOU_KNOW_DVS433
01:12:50,00 --> 01:12:56,50
Unseen by her, SOMEONE makes a fist and grimaces.
