IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS17
00:03:01,00 --> 00:03:08,50
As he and his dark-haired colleague exit onto a college campus, a title appears. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS18
00:03:06,00 --> 00:03:10,50
The Ides of March 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS19
00:03:07,00 --> 00:03:13,50
A painted barn declares, "Ohio for Morris." 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS20
00:03:10,00 --> 00:03:17,50
A roadside sign reads, "Pullman, America's Future Begins March 15." 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS21
00:03:14,00 --> 00:03:22,50
Supporters wave homemade posters, including "Gimme More Morris" and "Don't Pull For Pullman." 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS22
00:03:20,00 --> 00:03:25,50
A homeless man's sign states, "Will vote for food."  

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS23
00:04:05,00 --> 00:04:10,50
A headline reads, "Ohio Primary Too Close To Call". The young blonde woman deliver coffees.  

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS24
00:05:27,00 --> 00:05:35,50
The dark-haired campaign staffer drinks a coffee as he watches the debate on TV. In the auditorium, SOMEONE, a handsome gray-haired man, shakes hands with his balding opponent.  

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS25
00:05:33,00 --> 00:05:40,50
The two candidates wave at the audience. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS26
00:05:38,00 --> 00:05:48,50
Standing in a wing, a bearded man with sagging features looks across the stage and forces a terse smile. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS27
00:05:46,00 --> 00:05:52,50
In the opposite wing, a paunchy, fair-haired man returns the gesture. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS28
00:05:49,00 --> 00:05:54,50
The clean cut man joins him. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS29
00:05:58,00 --> 00:06:03,50
SOMEONE gives them an inquiring glance. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS30
00:06:06,00 --> 00:06:13,50
The two campaign staffers head backstage where the bearded man pours himself coffee. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS31
00:06:31,00 --> 00:06:35,50
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS32
00:06:35,00 --> 00:06:41,50
Munching on a doughnut, he smirks as he heads off. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS33
00:06:40,00 --> 00:06:48,50
Clenching his jaw, SOMEONE shakes his head then strides away, leaving SOMEONE alone with a tense look. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS34
00:06:48,00 --> 00:06:54,50
Still onstage, SOMEONE and SOMEONE continue to wave at the audience. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS36
00:06:58,00 --> 00:07:05,50
Now, a suited man with a trim mustache plays piano and sings at a bar. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS37
00:07:02,00 --> 00:07:08,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE sit at a table with a dark-haired woman in glasses. She scrutinizes the fair-haired campaign manager. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS38
00:07:20,00 --> 00:07:24,50
A guy brings drinks. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS39
00:07:40,00 --> 00:07:45,50
SOMEONE's grin fades. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS40
00:08:43,00 --> 00:08:47,50
He slaps the table. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS41
00:08:46,00 --> 00:08:50,50
He leaves SOMEONE alone with SOMEONE. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS42
00:10:53,00 --> 00:10:58,50
She gives SOMEONE a pitying look. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS43
00:10:57,00 --> 00:11:03,50
Gazing back at her with confident eyes, he shakes his head. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS45
00:11:07,00 --> 00:11:13,50
The singer croons into his microphone. Now holding a briefcase, SOMEONE exits the bar with SOMEONE. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS46
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:33,50
He lights a cigarette. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS47
00:11:52,00 --> 00:11:57,50
The next day at SOMEONE's campaign headquarters, 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS48
00:11:55,00 --> 00:11:59,50
SOMEONE shakes a box. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS49
00:13:17,00 --> 00:13:25,50
Entering an office with tall windows that look out into the bullpen, SOMEONE sits at a desk. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS50
00:13:22,00 --> 00:13:27,50
The young blonde woman walks in holding a folder. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS51
00:13:33,00 --> 00:13:39,50
Barely looking at her, he opens the folder and starts reading. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS52
00:14:13,00 --> 00:14:17,50
He returns the folder to her. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS53
00:14:19,00 --> 00:14:23,50
She gives a mocking grin. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS54
00:15:22,00 --> 00:15:27,50
He jots a note then looks at her. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS55
00:15:41,00 --> 00:15:46,50
He smiles to himself as she leaves. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS56
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:51,50
He gives an embarrassed nod, then sits back in his chair and gazes after her. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS57
00:15:52,00 --> 00:15:56,50
In a stately home, 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS58
00:16:34,00 --> 00:16:39,50
SOMEONE leans closer to Senator SOMEONE. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS59
00:16:54,00 --> 00:17:02,50
A woman in a gray blazer and ribbed sweater sets two glasses of whisky on a table between them. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS60
00:17:05,00 --> 00:17:12,50
He keeps his sharp-eyed gaze locked on SOMEONE at SOMEONE's headquarters, 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS61
00:17:16,00 --> 00:17:21,50
then holds out a laptop. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS62
00:17:29,00 --> 00:17:35,50
As SOMEONE reads the documents, SOMEONE waits with a bemused smile. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS63
00:17:47,00 --> 00:17:52,50
His lips screw to one side impatiently. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS64
00:17:49,00 --> 00:17:56,50
Seated facing him, SOMEONE interlaces his hands on a conference table. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS65
00:17:53,00 --> 00:17:59,50
The other staffers swap uneasy looks. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS66
00:17:56,00 --> 00:18:02,50
SOMEONE brings SOMEONE a printout of the op-ed piece. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS67
00:18:57,00 --> 00:19:03,50
As SOMEONE smirks, the governor cracks a smile. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS68
00:19:03,00 --> 00:19:08,50
The young adviser flashes a cocky grin. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS69
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:38,50
SOMEONE goes to his office and picks up the phone. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS70
00:19:47,00 --> 00:19:51,50
He shuts his door. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS71
00:19:59,00 --> 00:20:06,50
Leaning against a reflective window, SOMEONE knits his brow and takes a breath. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS72
00:20:22,00 --> 00:20:32,50
SOMEONE ends the call in his dimly lit office. On the other end, SOMEONE slowly twirls the phone in his hand as he hangs it up. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS73
00:20:34,00 --> 00:20:42,50
Through the window, he gazes out at SOMEONE and his diligent campaign staff as he makes a call on his cell. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS74
00:20:43,00 --> 00:20:53,50
He hangs up. Now, a neon sign reading "Head First" hangs in a window flanked by shutters painted with the words "Who Dey." 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS75
00:20:50,00 --> 00:20:56,50
SOMEONE sits in his car, staring at the bar. Later inside, 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS76
00:21:52,00 --> 00:21:58,50
SOMEONE regards SOMEONE with a cool, amused gaze. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS77
00:22:51,00 --> 00:22:57,50
SOMEONE scrutinizes his rival's earnest face. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS78
00:23:50,00 --> 00:23:57,50
His eyes gleaming in the dim light, SOMEONE abruptly gets to his feet and heads for the door. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS79
00:24:04,00 --> 00:24:10,50
Now SOMEONE talks on his cell as he steps into the daylight. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS80
00:24:26,00 --> 00:24:34,50
Silhouetted against the sunny day, he faces the bar's door frame and leans his head against it. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS81
00:24:42,00 --> 00:24:48,50
Now in a hotel suite, a woman applies makeup to SOMEONE. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS82
00:24:47,00 --> 00:24:53,50
In the next room, SOMEONE brings SOMEONE a file and sits by him. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS83
00:25:29,00 --> 00:25:33,50
Now with SOMEONE SOMEONE. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS84
00:26:39,00 --> 00:26:44,50
SOMEONE has drinks with SOMEONE in a bar. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS85
00:26:54,00 --> 00:26:59,50
His brow raised, SOMEONE manages a nod. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS86
00:27:24,00 --> 00:27:31,50
She gives him an alluring smirk. SOMEONE looks the young woman up and down. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS87
00:27:44,00 --> 00:27:49,50
He stares at her rosy lips. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS88
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:08,50
She returns a cool, enticing smirk. SOMEONE's heavy-lidded eyes remain fixed on her face. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS89
00:28:14,00 --> 00:28:19,50
He nods, suppressing a grin. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS90
00:28:52,00 --> 00:28:58,50
SOMEONE rubs her lips together, then gives a wicked grin. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS91
00:28:59,00 --> 00:29:05,50
Now, the bus sits haphazardly parked outside SOMEONE's hotel. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS92
00:29:43,00 --> 00:29:48,50
SOMEONE leaves his bed. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS93
00:29:55,00 --> 00:30:00,50
SOMEONE gets dressed as he talks. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS94
00:30:09,00 --> 00:30:13,50
She fastens her jeans. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS95
00:31:12,00 --> 00:31:16,50
She gives a cool shrug. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS96
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:33,50
She knots his tie. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS97
00:31:58,00 --> 00:32:05,50
She kisses him and turns away. Now at an airport, SOMEONE uses his cell. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS98
00:32:16,00 --> 00:32:23,50
Beneath an overcast sky, SOMEONE halts and turns on his heel. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS99
00:32:31,00 --> 00:32:37,50
Ending the call, he crosses a tarmac to a private jet. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS100
00:32:34,00 --> 00:32:41,50
Later in flight, he works beside SOMEONE who sits facing SOMEONE. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS101
00:32:38,00 --> 00:32:45,50
Turbulence jostles the aircraft causing SOMEONE to look up from his work. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS102
00:32:42,00 --> 00:32:48,50
He braces himself and shuts his eyes. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS103
00:33:11,00 --> 00:33:17,50
With a wry smile, SOMEONE glances out his window. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS104
00:34:22,00 --> 00:34:27,50
SOMEONE tenses as the plane jostles again. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS105
00:34:33,00 --> 00:34:40,50
Delivering his speech, SOMEONE glances at a woman and child off stage. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS106
00:35:14,00 --> 00:35:20,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE stands silhouetted against an American flag. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS107
00:36:18,00 --> 00:36:24,50
SOMEONE delivers his speech on the other side of the flag. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS108
00:36:55,00 --> 00:37:01,50
SOMEONE bows his head and massages his brow. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS109
00:37:23,00 --> 00:37:28,50
Backstage, SOMEONE shakes his head. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS110
00:37:45,00 --> 00:37:50,50
SOMEONE strides away. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS111
00:37:48,00 --> 00:37:58,50
Standing silhouetted against the backwards side of the American flag with his arms folded across his chest, SOMEONE hangs his head. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS112
00:37:59,00 --> 00:38:05,50
Now SOMEONE climbs a set of stairs in the filled auditorium. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS113
00:38:03,00 --> 00:38:10,50
She exits into a corridor where a bearded campaign staffer hands her some papers. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS114
00:38:08,00 --> 00:38:17,50
Taking them, she skims the top page as she heads down the hallway past a "Morris for President" banner along the wall. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS115
00:38:14,00 --> 00:38:23,50
She jogs up a stairwell to a pair of closed doors where SOMEONE and his Secret Service agents stand guard. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS116
00:38:20,00 --> 00:38:25,50
SOMEONE hands SOMEONE the papers. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS117
00:38:25,00 --> 00:38:33,50
In the middle of an empty rehearsal room, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE sit with their chairs huddled together. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS118
00:38:30,00 --> 00:38:39,50
As his campaign manager talks, the governor glances down and shoots a look at his young press secretary. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS119
00:39:53,00 --> 00:39:57,50
SOMEONE nods, his arms folded. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS120
00:39:57,00 --> 00:40:04,50
Pursing his lips into a resolute line, SOMEONE pats his own leg. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS122
00:40:32,00 --> 00:40:36,50
SOMEONE talks on the phone. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS123
00:40:46,00 --> 00:40:54,50
At night, the campaign bus drives down the highway. We follow it from an SUV. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS124
00:41:00,00 --> 00:41:05,50
Resting her head on his shoulder, his wife smiles. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS125
00:41:37,00 --> 00:41:41,50
SOMEONE lifts his eyes for a moment. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS126
00:41:51,00 --> 00:41:55,50
She shakes her head. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS127
00:42:11,00 --> 00:42:15,50
He kisses her forehead. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS128
00:42:12,00 --> 00:42:18,50
Closing her eyes, she nuzzles into his shoulder. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS129
00:42:33,00 --> 00:42:40,50
Setting his lips in a firm line, he glances at his wife. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS130
00:42:37,00 --> 00:42:42,50
She lifts her face to meet his gaze. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS132
00:43:21,00 --> 00:43:27,50
Now at a town hall meeting, SOMEONE hands SOMEONE a phone and returns to the meeting. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS133
00:43:48,00 --> 00:43:55,50
Later that night, the campaign bus cruises down a highway. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS134
00:43:52,00 --> 00:43:59,50
On board, SOMEONE squints at a laptop screen from behind a pair of glasses. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS135
00:43:56,00 --> 00:44:01,50
An instant message from SOMEONE pops up. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS136
00:43:59,00 --> 00:44:05,50
Do you need me to clean your room tonight? xoxo - The Cleaning Lady 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS137
00:44:03,00 --> 00:44:09,50
A smile spreads across SOMEONE's face and he removes his glasses. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS138
00:44:07,00 --> 00:44:12,50
Looking over his shoulder, he spots SOMEONE a few seats back. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS139
00:44:10,00 --> 00:44:17,50
She meets his gaze with a mischievous smile, then lowers her head and shakes it coyly. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS140
00:44:15,00 --> 00:44:22,50
Turning forward again, SOMEONE slides on his glasses and resumes working. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS141
00:44:19,00 --> 00:44:27,50
Later at his hotel, pale light edges his bare back as he and SOMEONE have sex. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS142
00:44:50,00 --> 00:44:55,50
SOMEONE glances at the town hall meeting on TV. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS143
00:44:54,00 --> 00:44:58,50
SOMEONE kisses him. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS144
00:45:04,00 --> 00:45:13,50
He buries his face against her neck. Later, she sleeps beside him as he sits in bed working on his laptop. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS145
00:45:12,00 --> 00:45:17,50
His gaze sweeps over the covers. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS146
00:45:16,00 --> 00:45:23,50
He wrungs his hands over the comforter, then searches inside its folds. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS147
00:45:20,00 --> 00:45:25,50
Finding his cellphone, he answers. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS148
00:45:26,00 --> 00:45:31,50
He pulls it away from his ear and frowns at it. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS149
00:45:30,00 --> 00:45:41,50
With a puzzled look, he turns to a bedside table and spots his own phone sitting on top. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS150
00:46:06,00 --> 00:46:10,50
He takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes, then wakes SOMEONE. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS151
00:46:18,00 --> 00:46:25,50
He hits redial. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS152
00:46:23,00 --> 00:46:31,50
With the cell to his ears, SOMEONE's playful expression fades as he listens. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS153
00:46:28,00 --> 00:46:33,50
Noting his reaction, SOMEONE sucks in a quick breath then averts her ashamed gaze. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS154
00:46:33,00 --> 00:46:39,50
SOMEONE lowers the phone and stares at it. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS155
00:46:40,00 --> 00:46:46,50
Hanging up, he shifts his eyes to SOMEONE who continues to look down. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS156
00:47:52,00 --> 00:47:57,50
She reluctantly meets his gaze, her eyes glistening with tears. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS157
00:47:56,00 --> 00:48:01,50
SOMEONE stares at her with wide eyes. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS158
00:48:06,00 --> 00:48:12,50
He lowers his gaze. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS159
00:48:49,00 --> 00:48:56,50
SOMEONE shifts nervously as he paces in front of the bed. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS160
00:48:55,00 --> 00:49:01,50
SOMEONE stares at her, his lips parted slightly in a stunned look. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS161
00:49:05,00 --> 00:49:10,50
A tear slides down SOMEONE's face and she swallows hard. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS162
00:49:08,00 --> 00:49:18,50
Turning away, he gives a tiny shake of his head. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS163
00:49:20,00 --> 00:49:31,50
The next day, SOMEONE strides down a sidewalk with his hands in the pockets of his dark trench coat, and his jaw set tight in a resolute expression. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS164
00:49:30,00 --> 00:49:36,50
Reaching campaign headquarters, he glances at an idealized poster of SOMEONE in a window, then swings open the door to the bullpen and steps inside. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS165
00:49:33,00 --> 00:49:41,50
Sitting behind a desk near the front of the room, SOMEONE glances up at him. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS166
00:49:44,00 --> 00:49:54,50
SOMEONE shoots her a brief look as he moves past the desks of the busy staffer. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS167
00:49:55,00 --> 00:50:05,50
With his lips set in a troubled line, he enters his office, takes a seat at his desk, and stares out through the windows of the bustling bullpen. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS168
00:50:02,00 --> 00:50:08,50
His gaze sweeps from some people examining writing on a whiteboard to the desks of other campaigners making phone calls and typing on laptops. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS169
00:50:11,00 --> 00:50:20,50
He stares at the back of SOMEONE's head as she works. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS170
00:50:19,00 --> 00:50:27,50
Pushing his chair away from his desk, he gets up and raps his knuckles on a side window which shows SOMEONE working next door. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS171
00:50:25,00 --> 00:50:31,50
SOMEONE glances over. Moving from the window, SOMEONE slides off his coat and drops it in a chair. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS172
00:50:30,00 --> 00:50:38,50
He rests a hand on the open door as SOMEONE enters. SOMEONE closes the door behind him, then sits on the edge of his desk and folds his arm. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS173
00:50:50,00 --> 00:50:55,50
He opens the door for SOMEONE to exit. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS175
00:51:03,00 --> 00:51:10,50
The staffers in the bullpen pause and look over. He heads back into his office.  

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS176
00:51:12,00 --> 00:51:17,50
SOMEONE anxiously gets up from her work and follows him. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS177
00:51:16,00 --> 00:51:25,50
As SOMEONE enters the office, he continues writing, then shoots the bullpen a cautious look as he hands her the slip of paper. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS179
00:51:25,00 --> 00:51:29,50
On SOMEONE' campaign stationary, it reads, "Meet me in the stairwell at noon." 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS181
00:51:33,00 --> 00:51:38,50
SOMEONE's shoulders rise with a relieved breath. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS182
00:51:41,00 --> 00:51:47,50
She returns the note to him and he rips it up. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS183
00:51:46,00 --> 00:51:55,50
He avoids her gaze. With a dejected nod, she leaves. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS184
00:51:52,00 --> 00:52:00,50
Later, SOMEONE removes his wallet from his coat pocket as he approaches the entrance to the Stock Yards Bank and Trust. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS185
00:51:58,00 --> 00:52:02,50
At a counter, he waits as a teller tallies a handful of bills and sets them in front of him. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS186
00:51:59,00 --> 00:52:05,50
He tucks the cash in his wallet. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS187
00:52:15,00 --> 00:52:21,50
Now, he takes a call as he exits the bank. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS188
00:52:28,00 --> 00:52:32,50
SOMEONE stops in his tracks, his brow furrows. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS190
00:55:10,00 --> 00:55:17,50
She strides off. Now, SOMEONE uses a payphone. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS191
00:55:14,00 --> 00:55:19,50
A man photographs a woman nearby with his camera pointed in SOMEONE's direction. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS192
00:55:29,00 --> 00:55:35,50
A news van sits parked at the curb. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS193
00:55:32,00 --> 00:55:39,50
He hangs up and hurries out of Fountain Square. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS194
00:55:36,00 --> 00:55:44,50
Now pale, hazy light hangs low behind the Cincinnati skyline. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS195
00:55:42,00 --> 00:55:48,50
At SOMEONE's campaign headquarters, SOMEONE enters a dark stairwell and climbs up past the first landing. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS196
00:55:49,00 --> 00:55:54,50
She stops halfway to the second one and looks around. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS197
00:55:53,00 --> 00:56:00,50
SOMEONE emerges from the shadows. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS198
00:56:30,00 --> 00:56:35,50
She continues up the stairs and joins him on the second landing. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS199
00:57:14,00 --> 00:57:18,50
SOMEONE gives him a tearful, dejected look. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS200
00:57:35,00 --> 00:57:41,50
Now, in SOMEONE's hotel room, SOMEONE gets a text from SOMEONE, "noon tomorrow.” 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS203
00:57:51,00 --> 00:57:57,50
He eyes his cellphone. It reads SOMEONE calling.   

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS204
00:57:55,00 --> 00:57:59,50
SOMEONE pockets the phone and tightens his jaw.  

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS206
00:58:02,00 --> 00:58:09,50
SOMEONE waits in a car outside a motel with the campaign bus parked nearby. SOMEONE comes out. He watches her approach.  

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS207
00:58:06,00 --> 00:58:12,50
His gaze softens as it returns to SOMEONE who carries a coat draped over her arm. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS208
00:58:09,00 --> 00:58:17,50
She gets in beside him and they share a brief look. Now we peer up at the Roebling Suspension Bridge. SOMEONE drives SOMEONE across. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS209
00:58:18,00 --> 00:58:27,50
Leaning back against her headrest, she swallows and lifts her chin, then briefly closes her dark-lashed eyes. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS210
00:58:24,00 --> 00:58:30,50
She looks to SOMEONE with a vulnerable pout. He keeps his inscrutable gaze fixed on the road. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS211
00:58:27,00 --> 00:58:33,50
SOMEONE turns away sadly and stares ahead. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS213
00:58:35,00 --> 00:58:40,50
Later, the car turns onto a city street. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS214
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:47,50
As it pulls into a parking lot, it passes a sign reading, "Oakley Women's Clinic of Cincinnati.” Now SOMEONE fills out paperwork at a reception desk while SOMEONE waits beside her. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS215
00:58:45,00 --> 00:58:52,50
She turns in the forms to a nurse who hands SOMEONE a pink printout. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS217
00:58:53,00 --> 00:58:59,50
He folds it in half as the woman speaks to him. Nodding, he replies, "Okay." 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS219
00:58:59,00 --> 00:59:05,50
He and SOMEONE sit down in the otherwise empty waiting room. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS220
00:59:05,00 --> 00:59:10,50
Neither of them looks the other in the eye. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS221
00:59:10,00 --> 00:59:16,50
As he faces SOMEONE, she returns a stunned expression. She looks away, her lips trembling. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS223
00:59:27,00 --> 00:59:32,50
She glares at SOMEONE with tears in her eyes. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS224
00:59:30,00 --> 00:59:36,50
He gets to his feet. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS225
00:59:34,00 --> 00:59:39,50
He kisses her forehead, and goes. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS226
00:59:37,00 --> 00:59:44,50
She tearfully works her jaw as she looks away. Now SOMEONE lies on his rumpled bed in his hotel suite, talking on his cellphone. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS227
00:59:49,00 --> 00:59:53,50
He gets up. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS228
00:59:56,00 --> 01:00:00,50
He answers the door. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS229
01:00:24,00 --> 01:00:29,50
SOMEONE swigs from a bottle of water. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS230
01:00:28,00 --> 01:00:35,50
Working on a laptop nearby, SOMEONE looks back and forth between them. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS231
01:00:32,00 --> 01:00:37,50
SOMEONE reclines in his chair. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS232
01:00:39,00 --> 01:00:46,50
His hands on his hips, he shuffles closer to the campaign manager. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS233
01:00:49,00 --> 01:00:56,50
He sinks down in a chair, leans forward, and interlaces his hand. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS234
01:01:15,00 --> 01:01:20,50
SOMEONE stares at him with a lifted brow. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS235
01:01:18,00 --> 01:01:23,50
He averts his gaze and shuts his laptop. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS236
01:01:21,00 --> 01:01:26,50
He takes it out of the room. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS237
01:01:24,00 --> 01:01:31,50
SOMEONE's brow knits in a bewildered frown and he opens his hands. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS238
01:01:31,00 --> 01:01:39,50
His arms folded, the campaign manager calmly regards him without a trace of remorse. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS239
01:02:44,00 --> 01:02:51,50
SOMEONE lowers his mouth to his upraised hand and shakes his head. SOMEONE takes out his cigarettes. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS241
01:03:48,00 --> 01:03:53,50
He gets to his feet and paces. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS242
01:04:45,00 --> 01:04:51,50
His eyes wide, SOMEONE nods, then looks away. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS243
01:04:49,00 --> 01:04:57,50
At the women's clinic, SOMEONE slumps back in a waiting room chair, her hands over her lower abdomen. A nurse hands her a prescription pill bottle. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS245
01:04:57,00 --> 01:05:04,50
SOMEONE eyes the label and nods receptively as she listens. The nurse then hands her another bottle of pills. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS247
01:05:04,00 --> 01:05:09,50
SOMEONE nods again with a grave frown. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS248
01:05:07,00 --> 01:05:15,50
Her eyes drift back and forth from the nurse to the bottles in her slender, graceful hands. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS249
01:05:12,00 --> 01:05:19,50
SOMEONE meets the woman's gaze with wide eyes and gives a final nod. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS250
01:05:16,00 --> 01:05:24,50
As the nurse steps away, the young abortion patient briefly musters a smile for her. Now, SOMEONE loosens his tie and sighs tensely as he drives down a city street. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS252
01:05:28,00 --> 01:05:37,50
At the clinic, a lamp softly illuminates the dusky waiting room as SOMEONE clutches her medicine in a bag between her knees. She shifts pensively in her chair. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS253
01:05:35,00 --> 01:05:40,50
On the road, SOMEONE stares ahead with a sullen gaze. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS255
01:05:42,00 --> 01:05:49,50
Outside the clinic, SOMEONE clutches her coat around her as she leaves on foot. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS256
01:05:46,00 --> 01:05:52,50
She glances at traffic on the road beside her, and then approaches a cafe. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS257
01:05:51,00 --> 01:05:57,50
Later, she sits inside in a booth by a window. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS258
01:05:54,00 --> 01:06:03,50
As the sky grows darker outside, she peers out in the clinic's direction, then checks her watch. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS259
01:06:00,00 --> 01:06:05,50
Lifting her gaze, she stares off grimly. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS260
01:06:03,00 --> 01:06:09,50
As SOMEONE drives on, we glimpse the sunset outside. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS261
01:06:08,00 --> 01:06:14,50
At night, he finally arrives outside the clinic. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS262
01:06:11,00 --> 01:06:16,50
Finding it closed, he drives on. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS263
01:06:15,00 --> 01:06:21,50
Outside her motel, SOMEONE exits a taxicab. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS264
01:06:32,00 --> 01:06:36,50
She lets SOMEONE into her room. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS265
01:07:24,00 --> 01:07:28,50
SOMEONE's eyes glisten. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS266
01:07:34,00 --> 01:07:39,50
Her jaw drops open in a horrified expression. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS267
01:07:37,00 --> 01:07:45,50
Leaning forward, she brings a hand to her mouth and shifts her hopeless, tearful gaze. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS268
01:07:42,00 --> 01:07:49,50
Now SOMEONE marches purposefully down a sidewalk, his jaw set tight. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS269
01:07:46,00 --> 01:07:54,50
He arrives at a storefront with a banner over the entrance reading, "Pullman for President", and goes in. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS270
01:07:55,00 --> 01:08:00,50
He holds his wrathful gaze fixed straight ahead. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS271
01:07:58,00 --> 01:08:05,50
At the far end of the campaign headquarters, SOMEONE meets with colleagues in a dimly lit office. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS272
01:08:03,00 --> 01:08:08,50
He spots SOMEONE and gives a grim smirk. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS273
01:08:05,00 --> 01:08:11,50
Later, they enter another small office together. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS274
01:08:16,00 --> 01:08:23,50
SOMEONE glances back at the departing staffer, and then faces SOMEONE. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS275
01:09:27,00 --> 01:09:34,50
SOMEONE steps in closer, his face half-obscured in shadow. He gives a nod. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS276
01:11:40,00 --> 01:11:46,50
SOMEONE abruptly turns away and leaves the room. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS277
01:11:43,00 --> 01:11:50,50
SOMEONE lingers, gazing after him with gleaming eyes. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS278
01:11:47,00 --> 01:11:58,50
Now we view him from behind as he drives. With a slow, steady rhythm, his wiper sweep rain from his windshield as the city lights twinkle outside. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS279
01:11:55,00 --> 01:12:01,50
Later at SOMEONE's motel, he exits the car. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS280
01:11:58,00 --> 01:12:06,50
Indoors, we peer down through a narrow gap at a stairwell banister and glimpsed SOMEONE climbing up. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS281
01:12:04,00 --> 01:12:11,50
Arriving in a hallway, he spots a man using a walkie-talkie as he hurries from a room. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS282
01:12:14,00 --> 01:12:19,50
SOMEONE continues coolly down the hall. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS283
01:12:17,00 --> 01:12:23,50
Arriving at the door to SOMEONE's room, he tenses as he finds it ajar. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS284
01:12:20,00 --> 01:12:25,50
He gives it a knock, then pushes it open. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS285
01:12:23,00 --> 01:12:29,50
A shadowy figure sits on the bed with his back to us. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS286
01:12:27,00 --> 01:12:32,50
SOMEONE makes his way over with a furrowed brow. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS287
01:12:36,00 --> 01:12:47,50
He halts and stares down with glistening eyes. Her face out of view behind the bed, SOMEONE lies motionless on the floor, her legs and left arm splayed awkwardly. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS288
01:12:45,00 --> 01:12:50,50
Fighting tears, Stephens steps a little closer. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS289
01:12:49,00 --> 01:12:56,50
Holding the room's phone to his ear, the man on the bed regards him sympathetically. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS290
01:13:01,00 --> 01:13:07,50
SOMEONE sees the pill bottles on a bedside table. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS291
01:13:12,00 --> 01:13:19,50
SOMEONE notices SOMEONE's cell peeking out from under her coat on the bed. With his back turned to him, the man on the bed sits in silhouette against the room's soft lamp light. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS293
01:13:24,00 --> 01:13:29,50
Later, SOMEONE steps back out into the rainy night. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS294
01:13:27,00 --> 01:13:33,50
Moving with a stiff gait, he marches across the parking lot to his car. As he gets in, rain patters heavily against his windshield. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS296
01:13:34,00 --> 01:13:40,50
The wipers move in a slow rhythm against the downpour. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS297
01:13:39,00 --> 01:13:46,50
The water cast modeled shadows against SOMEONE's face as he steers off forlornly. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS298
01:13:45,00 --> 01:13:53,50
He sets SOMEONE's phone down, and takes out his own, and scrolls through the menu to check his messages. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS299
01:14:30,00 --> 01:14:34,50
His eyes welled with tears. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS300
01:14:32,00 --> 01:14:38,50
The next day at campaign headquarters, SOMEONE and the others watch a news report. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS301
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:05,50
Now, as a figure sits on a bench facing the Ohio River, 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS302
01:15:02,00 --> 01:15:07,50
SOMEONE's lanky frame steps into view. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS303
01:15:05,00 --> 01:15:10,50
He walks up to the bench and takes a seat. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS304
01:15:07,00 --> 01:15:15,50
Both men stare out over the river's slate gray water towards Cincinnati on the other side. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS305
01:15:15,00 --> 01:15:24,50
As traffic moves across the nearby Roebling Bridge, Senator SOMEONE narrows his eyes and wets his lips. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS306
01:15:42,00 --> 01:15:48,50
SOMEONE regards him with a sober frown and nods. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS307
01:15:45,00 --> 01:15:52,50
SOMEONE faces him with a furrowed brow and glances warily past his shoulder. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS308
01:15:52,00 --> 01:16:00,50
The young man stares at the senator through narrowed eyes, his lips pressed tightly shut. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS309
01:15:57,00 --> 01:16:04,50
SOMEONE reaches out hesitantly, then gives his leg a brisk pat and leaves. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS310
01:16:03,00 --> 01:16:11,50
Now at a press conference, Paul, Ben, and the other staffers flank SOMEONE as he gives a statement. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS311
01:17:10,00 --> 01:17:17,50
He looks to SOMEONE and moves up to the podium. SOMEONE steps aside and checks his cell. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS312
01:17:28,00 --> 01:17:33,50
The phone display reads, "Molly calling.” 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS313
01:17:31,00 --> 01:17:38,50
SOMEONE scans the room and his gaze falls on two police officers. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS314
01:17:37,00 --> 01:17:44,50
Noting their casual expressions, he looks past them to other attendee. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS315
01:17:43,00 --> 01:17:49,50
He finds SOMEONE holding SOMEONE's cellphone to his ear. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS316
01:17:48,00 --> 01:17:55,50
A flashbulb pops on the governor's wide-eyed stare. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS317
01:17:52,00 --> 01:17:58,50
SOMEONE lowers the phone with a cold expression. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS318
01:17:55,00 --> 01:17:59,50
SOMEONE clenches his jaw. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS319
01:18:02,00 --> 01:18:11,50
Nighttime. Seen from behind, SOMEONE leads us down a sidewalk, following the wall of a shadowy brick building. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS320
01:18:08,00 --> 01:18:14,50
Two black SUVs wait outside the closed establishment. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS321
01:18:13,00 --> 01:18:20,50
SOMEONE stops and peers in through a window with open blinds on the inside. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS322
01:18:17,00 --> 01:18:24,50
He enters a front vestibule and steps into the dim establishment. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS323
01:18:22,00 --> 01:18:30,50
As he peers across the room, all but the lower quadrant of his face remains cast in shadow. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS324
01:18:28,00 --> 01:18:34,50
At the end of a long empty bar, a man stands in silhouette in the dark. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS325
01:18:32,00 --> 01:18:39,50
SOMEONE crosses the darkened room, passing a dozen unoccupied barstools. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS326
01:18:38,00 --> 01:18:46,50
He steps past the motionless Secret Service agent and heads through an illuminated doorway to a kitchen. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS327
01:18:45,00 --> 01:18:52,50
He crosses a well-lit section on his way to another darkened area. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS328
01:18:49,00 --> 01:18:57,50
Beyond stock shelves on a center counter, light shine under an industrial range hood. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS329
01:18:57,00 --> 01:19:02,50
SOMEONE shifts his gaze. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS330
01:19:02,00 --> 01:19:08,50
He ambles around the counter and finds the governor. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS331
01:20:31,00 --> 01:20:35,50
SOMEONE turns away. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS332
01:20:33,00 --> 01:20:41,50
He abruptly returns his gaze to the former staffer and the two maintain eye contact. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS333
01:20:38,00 --> 01:20:45,50
Shadow conceals all but a lower quarter of the governor's face. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS334
01:21:39,00 --> 01:21:45,50
SOMEONE draws a tense breath. SOMEONE remains still. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS335
01:22:02,00 --> 01:22:10,50
SOMEONE steps from the shadows, his right eye becoming glaringly visible in the dim light. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS336
01:22:36,00 --> 01:22:42,50
SOMEONE swallows his smirk. His expression hardens. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS337
01:23:19,00 --> 01:23:24,50
SOMEONE remains poker-faced. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS338
01:23:32,00 --> 01:23:39,50
SOMEONE maintains eye contact with SOMEONE who glowers and swallows. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS340
01:23:38,00 --> 01:23:46,50
In a barbershop, a seated a bibbed SOMEONE gets a haircut by a barber standing behind him. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS341
01:23:45,00 --> 01:23:52,50
Our view slowly roves around the side of the paunchy, middle-aged campaign manager 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS342
01:23:49,00 --> 01:23:55,50
who gazes flatly from under his wrinkled brow. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS343
01:23:56,00 --> 01:24:03,50
Later, SOMEONE steps outside wearing his thick-rimmed glasses. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS344
01:24:00,00 --> 01:24:06,50
Beyond him, a black SUV idles just footsteps away. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS345
01:24:03,00 --> 01:24:10,50
Poking out of a nearby alley, another sits parked by the curb. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS346
01:24:07,00 --> 01:24:14,50
The campaign manager lights a cigarette then notices the SUV. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS347
01:24:13,00 --> 01:24:21,50
Taking a few drags, he heads down the sidewalk and approaches the vehicle in the alleyway. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS348
01:24:19,00 --> 01:24:25,50
A backseat window rolls down revealing SOMEONE inside. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS349
01:24:27,00 --> 01:24:34,50
The tinted window rolls up and SOMEONE manages a final pull on his cigarette. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS350
01:24:31,00 --> 01:24:37,50
He stubs it out on a wall and climbs into the SUV. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS351
01:24:36,00 --> 01:24:42,50
A head-on view of the black car gradually drifts toward the grill. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS352
01:24:39,00 --> 01:24:47,50
Its front tires rest in a buildup of icy gray slush on the alley apron. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS353
01:24:44,00 --> 01:24:51,50
To the left, exhaust blooms from the tailpipe of the second SUV. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS354
01:24:51,00 --> 01:25:00,50
The view keeps inching toward the nose of SOMEONE' vehicle until most of the second SUV falls out of view. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS355
01:24:58,00 --> 01:25:04,50
The forward moving trip ceases halfway across the street. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS356
01:25:04,00 --> 01:25:08,50
The backdoor opens. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS357
01:25:06,00 --> 01:25:11,50
SOMEONE steps out and shuts it behind him. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS358
01:25:08,00 --> 01:25:15,50
The SUV pulls out of the alley and drives off, followed by its twin. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS359
01:25:13,00 --> 01:25:19,50
With his hands in his coat pockets, SOMEONE peers after them. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS360
01:25:16,00 --> 01:25:22,50
He shifts his wry and resigned gaze. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS361
01:25:19,00 --> 01:25:25,50
Now on a hotel room, SOMEONE watches TV while shaving. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS362
01:25:42,00 --> 01:25:48,50
Now, a hearse and three black cars wait outside a cathedral. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS363
01:25:46,00 --> 01:25:54,50
Inside, a dark wood coffin topped by an arrangement of white flowers lies at the front of a packed sanctuary. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS364
01:25:52,00 --> 01:25:56,50
SOMEONE Stearns stands at a podium. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS365
01:26:03,00 --> 01:26:08,50
The bereaved father swallows, then glances upward. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS366
01:26:14,00 --> 01:26:21,50
Among the attendees, SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE who sits across the aisle a few rows up. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS367
01:26:30,00 --> 01:26:36,50
He returns his attention to the chairman who wipes his nose. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS368
01:26:56,00 --> 01:27:03,50
The distraught father nods, then lowers his gaze and hangs his head. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS369
01:27:01,00 --> 01:27:10,50
Later as SOMEONE exit the cathedral, SOMEONE smokes a cigarette as he ambles across a wintry lawn of dead grass. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS370
01:27:08,00 --> 01:27:12,50
He approaches SOMEONE. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS371
01:28:23,00 --> 01:28:27,50
He heads off. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS372
01:28:26,00 --> 01:28:34,50
SOMEONE gets into his car. Now, SOMEONE stands at a podium with SOMEONE and his wife beside him. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS373
01:28:45,00 --> 01:28:54,50
The crowd of excited supporters wave American flags and hold signs. SOMEONE stands motionless toward the back. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS374
01:29:25,00 --> 01:29:37,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE swap grins. SOMEONE whispers in his endorser's ears. They shake hands. Outside, a brunette young woman carries two trays of coffees. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS375
01:29:37,00 --> 01:29:42,50
The intern strides briskly with the delivery. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS376
01:29:48,00 --> 01:29:56,50
She marches past an information booth, enters the crowded hall, and brings SOMEONE one of the coffees. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS377
01:30:02,00 --> 01:30:06,50
SOMEONE nods. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS378
01:30:35,00 --> 01:30:40,50
SOMEONE gazes absently. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS379
01:30:41,00 --> 01:30:49,50
Now, the new campaign manager leads the way down a hall into a room marked "Morris Event Staff Only.” 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS380
01:30:47,00 --> 01:30:53,50
Staff members sit at laptops facing three flat screens. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS381
01:30:50,00 --> 01:30:59,50
SOMEONE accepts his jacket from a colleague and puts it on. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS383
01:31:06,00 --> 01:31:11,50
As SOMEONE leaves, a TV shows an interview with SOMEONE.  

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS384
01:31:24,00 --> 01:31:32,50
The brunette intern faces SOMEONE. Outside, SOMEONE marches across a walkway and heads up the front steps of the campus building. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS385
01:31:31,00 --> 01:31:36,50
Later, he heads down an empty stairwell. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS387
01:31:35,00 --> 01:31:42,50
SOMEONE waits in a corridor. She follows SOMEONE down the hall toward a pair of imposing guards. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS388
01:31:47,00 --> 01:31:51,50
He dons his ID. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS389
01:32:15,00 --> 01:32:22,50
They share a knowing gaze, then SOMEONE files past one of the security guards. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS390
01:32:20,00 --> 01:32:27,50
Walking in our direction, he crosses a darkened corridor, his face cast in shadow. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS391
01:32:25,00 --> 01:32:33,50
An overhead light briefly reveals the young campaign manager's emotionless gaze. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS392
01:32:31,00 --> 01:32:39,50
As he continues his stride, another overhead offers a second glimpse of his plain look. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS393
01:32:38,00 --> 01:32:46,50
In a dim gymnasium, an empty canvass and wood director's chair awaits. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS394
01:32:43,00 --> 01:32:50,50
Beyond it, the lone campaign manager emerges as a blurry form from the corridor. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS395
01:32:48,00 --> 01:32:58,50
SOMEONE arrives at the makeshift set and takes a seat under a spotlight, illuminating a patch of the otherwise darkened gym floor. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS396
01:32:55,00 --> 01:33:03,50
A soundman outfits him with an earpiece while a makeup artist touches up his face. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS398
01:33:06,00 --> 01:33:14,50
The makeup artist leaves. As the soundman preps him for the interview, our view gradually orbits around the side of SOMEONE's face. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS399
01:33:20,00 --> 01:33:26,50
SOMEONE nods, gazing straight ahead with a deadpan expression. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS400
01:33:33,00 --> 01:33:41,50
As our view finally settles facing the young campaign manager, SOMEONE looks to his left. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS401
01:33:38,00 --> 01:33:47,50
He notices the blonde-haired makeup artist admiring him, then faces the camera and lowers his gaze. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS402
01:34:08,00 --> 01:34:16,50
We gradually press in on the campaign manager's handsome face, his eyes downcast. 

IDES_OF_MARCH_DVS403
01:34:33,00 --> 01:34:38,50
SOMEONE looks directly at us.
