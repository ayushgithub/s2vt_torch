THE_ROOMMATE_DVS4
00:05:02,00 --> 00:05:05,50
They arrive back at the door. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS6
00:05:33,00 --> 00:05:43,50
SOMEONE smiles and bites her lip coyly. Stepping close, she plants a tender kiss on the drummer's lips. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS7
00:05:43,00 --> 00:05:49,50
They share a warm smile and he regards her fondly. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS8
00:05:48,00 --> 00:05:52,50
SOMEONE wears his jacket. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS9
00:05:57,00 --> 00:06:05,50
As he goes, SOMEONE smiles after him. Later, she steps off the elevator on her floor. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS10
00:06:04,00 --> 00:06:12,50
She strolls tipsily down the hall and enters her darkened dorm room. Crossing toward her bed. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS12
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:44,50
In a tank top and cotton shorts, SOMEONE crosses to the lamp and switches it off. In the hall, SOMEONE steps out of the bathroom with her hand to her head. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS13
00:06:42,00 --> 00:06:54,50
Returning to the room, she peers into the darkness through bleary eyes. SOMEONE shuts the door and crosses toward her bed. Pausing, she faces her new roommate. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS14
00:06:53,00 --> 00:07:20,50
The pretty blonde lies under a comforter with her eyes closed. SOMEONE crosses to her bed, lies down on top of the covers, and huddles under the drummer's jacket. Daytime. Intersecting paths on the bustling quad make a bold X shape in the grass. In bed, SOMEONE rolls over beneath her comforter and groggily wakes. Across the room, SOMEONE hangs up drawings. Turning, she offers her roommate a smile. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS15
00:07:20,00 --> 00:07:25,50
The brunette stares with a sleepy pout. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS16
00:07:34,00 --> 00:07:39,50
She gives SOMEONE pills and water. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS17
00:07:37,00 --> 00:07:45,50
The hungover freshman pops the white pills in her mouth and uncaps the bottle of water. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS18
00:07:45,00 --> 00:07:50,50
SOMEONE resumes hanging drawings. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS19
00:07:53,00 --> 00:07:58,50
Admiring them, SOMEONE sips her water. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS20
00:08:09,00 --> 00:08:16,50
Looks up to find SOMEONE checking her cell display. It reads - SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS21
00:08:30,00 --> 00:08:35,50
She ends the call and joins SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS22
00:09:06,00 --> 00:09:11,50
Stylish clothes fill SOMEONE's closet. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS23
00:09:42,00 --> 00:09:47,50
SOMEONE's fashion design portfolio. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS24
00:09:46,00 --> 00:09:51,50
SOMEONE flips through its pages. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS25
00:09:54,00 --> 00:09:59,50
SOMEONE crosses to her sketchpad. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS26
00:10:01,00 --> 00:10:06,50
Now sprinkler activate on a campus lawn. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS27
00:10:04,00 --> 00:10:08,50
In a dining hall. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS29
00:11:03,00 --> 00:11:08,50
He notices SOMEONE and stares piercingly. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS31
00:11:47,00 --> 00:11:53,50
She smiles and starts to leave. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS32
00:11:51,00 --> 00:11:55,50
Pausing, she turns back. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS33
00:11:53,00 --> 00:12:01,50
The professor holds a handout for the form. SOMEONE returns and he signs it. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS34
00:12:04,00 --> 00:12:12,50
SOMEONE grins broadly. Professor SOMEONE returns the form, and she smiles gratefully. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS35
00:12:42,00 --> 00:12:50,50
SOMEONE crosses back to her own bed. Flopping down with a slight pout, she puts in ear buds 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS37
00:13:58,00 --> 00:14:02,50
and picks on her stalls. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS38
00:14:03,00 --> 00:14:22,50
Outside the bar, SOMEONE heads down an alley past a few club goers huddled in pairs. Reaching an adjacent sidewalk, she stops and looks around. In the dorm, SOMEONE lies in bed, her gaze forlorn. She sits up and grabs her cellphone from a nightstand. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS39
00:14:28,00 --> 00:14:34,50
Now in a diner, SOMEONE stirs a cup of coffee, sitting alone at a booth. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS40
00:14:32,00 --> 00:14:44,50
She cranes her neck as a car arrives. Outside, SOMEONE shuts the door of her red convertible. She enters the restaurant and joins her roommate at the booth. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS41
00:14:42,00 --> 00:14:48,50
SOMEONE gives a tight-lipped smile. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS42
00:15:24,00 --> 00:15:29,50
at a museum. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS43
00:15:37,00 --> 00:15:42,50
SOMEONE nervously watches SOMEONE check her cellphone. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS44
00:15:44,00 --> 00:15:48,50
SOMEONE rolls her eyes. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS45
00:15:47,00 --> 00:15:53,50
The roommates approach a large oil painting in another section. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS46
00:15:52,00 --> 00:15:58,50
It shows a blurry nurse peering over a surgical mask. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS47
00:15:59,00 --> 00:16:03,50
SOMEONE furrows her brow. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS48
00:16:02,00 --> 00:16:11,50
A dark red splotch at the nurse's neck gives the impression of a slit throat. SOMEONE looks back at her friend. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS49
00:16:09,00 --> 00:16:17,50
She returns her attention to the unsettling painting. Outside, 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS50
00:16:30,00 --> 00:16:36,50
SOMEONE takes out a camera and SOMEONE poses. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS51
00:16:35,00 --> 00:16:44,50
They pose together in front of the graffitied wall. SOMEONE looks at the digital photo, then spots a tattoo shop. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS52
00:16:51,00 --> 00:16:56,50
She reveals the name SOMEONE over her heart. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS53
00:17:07,00 --> 00:17:15,50
Now in their dorm, beyond the photo of SOMEONE and her sister, SOMEONE sits at a laptop. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS54
00:17:17,00 --> 00:17:22,50
SOMEONE joins her by the computer. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS56
00:17:41,00 --> 00:17:45,50
SOMEONE hangs out the devil high heel. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS57
00:17:45,00 --> 00:17:49,50
SOMEONE jogs outside. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS58
00:17:48,00 --> 00:17:53,50
SOMEONE turns away from a window. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS59
00:17:53,00 --> 00:17:57,50
She casually walks. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS60
00:18:23,00 --> 00:18:28,50
She takes a necklace hanged on a photo frame on an end table. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS61
00:18:40,00 --> 00:18:44,50
She tries the necklace in the mirror. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS63
00:18:54,00 --> 00:18:58,50
As she discovers a black and white kitten drinking from a run off pipe. She gently scoops it up. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS64
00:19:02,00 --> 00:19:11,50
SOMEONE looks up as SOMEONE enters their room. They share a smile, then SOMEONE notices the poster over her roommate's bed. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS65
00:19:13,00 --> 00:19:20,50
SOMEONE sits on her bed. Something moves underneath her grey hooded sweatshirt. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS66
00:19:20,00 --> 00:19:24,50
Wincing, she reveals the kitten. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS67
00:19:28,00 --> 00:19:33,50
SOMEONE joins her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS68
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:37,50
She pets the tiny kitten. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS69
00:19:47,00 --> 00:19:52,50
SOMEONE notices the necklace around SOMEONE's neck. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS70
00:19:51,00 --> 00:19:56,50
SOMEONE quickly takes it off. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS71
00:20:10,00 --> 00:20:14,50
SOMEONE sits beside her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS72
00:20:45,00 --> 00:20:50,50
Daytime. SOMEONE works at a coffee shop. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS73
00:20:48,00 --> 00:20:57,50
She leaves two customers, clears the table, then steps behind a busy counter where a co-worker reads a magazine. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS75
00:21:05,00 --> 00:21:10,50
The drummer leans on the counter. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS76
00:21:11,00 --> 00:21:16,50
They share a smile. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS77
00:21:46,00 --> 00:21:52,50
SOMEONE exits the elevator and passes SOMEONE in a common room. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS78
00:21:50,00 --> 00:21:56,50
As SOMEONE stops, SOMEONE leaves the restroom and eavesdrops. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS79
00:22:07,00 --> 00:22:12,50
SOMEONE gets up from a couch and faces her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS80
00:22:20,00 --> 00:22:29,50
SOMEONE hugs her. SOMEONE steps out from behind a partition, and locks eyes with the suntanned blonde as she passes. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS82
00:22:50,00 --> 00:22:58,50
SOMEONE sits on her bed. SOMEONE grabs the necklace near the two tickets on her desk. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS83
00:23:02,00 --> 00:23:08,50
The closet. SOMEONE parts the hanging clothes and takes out a jacket. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS84
00:23:18,00 --> 00:23:23,50
Crosses the room to retrieve something from a drawer, then returns to SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS85
00:23:21,00 --> 00:23:25,50
She places it in her hand. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS86
00:23:30,00 --> 00:23:40,50
As SOMEONE leaves, SOMEONE opens her hand to find a set of large drop earrings with yellow toned stones. She looks at herself in the mirror. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS87
00:23:39,00 --> 00:23:46,50
Tucking her hair back behind one ear, she studies the unpierced lobe. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS88
00:23:46,00 --> 00:23:53,50
SOMEONE flashes a little smile at her reflection, and takes a step closer to the mirror. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS89
00:23:52,00 --> 00:23:59,50
She raises an earring to her lobe, and winces as she begins to drive it through. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS90
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:05,50
The post pops through the back of the lobe. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS91
00:24:04,00 --> 00:24:13,50
She adjusts the backing, then lowers her hand to find a drop of blood on her thumb. She licks it off. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS92
00:24:13,00 --> 00:24:21,50
As the young woman gazes wide eyed at her reflection, a smile spreads across her lips. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS93
00:24:21,00 --> 00:24:31,50
Later, SOMEONE sends a text message to Stephen, Sorry, next time. She and SOMEONE wander off through the gallery. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS94
00:24:30,00 --> 00:24:35,50
Nighttime. At the dorm, our view slowly moves down the dimly lit hallway. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS96
00:24:40,00 --> 00:24:46,50
In her room, SOMEONE sits up in bed and rubs her brow. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS97
00:24:49,00 --> 00:24:55,50
She groggily gets up and crosses the dim room. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS98
00:24:54,00 --> 00:25:01,50
At the foot of her roommate's bed, she kneels before a mini fridge. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS99
00:24:59,00 --> 00:25:03,50
The roommate stirs in her sleep. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS100
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:11,50
SOMEONE opens the door and takes out a near empty plastic water bottle. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS101
00:25:11,00 --> 00:25:17,50
She closes the refrigerator. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS102
00:25:15,00 --> 00:25:21,50
She goes to the door. Opening it, SOMEONE finds SOMEONE sitting in the hallway. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS103
00:25:22,00 --> 00:25:27,50
Glaring, the pale blonde stands. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS104
00:25:25,00 --> 00:25:38,50
SOMEONE strides closer to Tracy, who leans back a touch and eyes her nervously. SOMEONE looks her up and down. SOMEONE gapes at the intimidating young woman. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS105
00:25:36,00 --> 00:25:42,50
With a look of disgust, SOMEONE walks away. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS106
00:25:39,00 --> 00:25:46,50
SOMEONE watches her go, then lowers her frightened gaze. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS107
00:25:44,00 --> 00:25:51,50
Daytime. SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk across the campus. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS108
00:25:57,00 --> 00:26:01,50
SOMEONE catches up with SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS109
00:26:23,00 --> 00:26:34,50
A frustrated SOMEONE watches SOMEONE walk away, then notices SOMEONE spying on her from behind a low brick wall.  

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS110
00:26:32,00 --> 00:26:37,50
Wide eyed, SOMEONE leaves. Now in Professor SOMEONE's class, 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS111
00:26:45,00 --> 00:26:50,50
He receives a text from SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS112
00:26:47,00 --> 00:26:52,50
5th and Spring, be there now. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS113
00:26:57,00 --> 00:27:02,50
SOMEONE smirks. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS114
00:27:11,00 --> 00:27:17,50
Now SOMEONE steps outside to find SOMEONE with a coffee. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS116
00:27:46,00 --> 00:27:54,50
She crosses a sidewalk. Inside, she ascends a spiral staircase. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS117
00:27:56,00 --> 00:28:00,50
She enters designers room. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS120
00:28:35,00 --> 00:28:41,50
Now in a library, SOMEONE studies alone at a table. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS121
00:28:41,00 --> 00:28:47,50
SOMEONE sets down her bag and takes a seat beside him. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS122
00:29:18,00 --> 00:29:22,50
Now at the dorm. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS124
00:29:49,00 --> 00:29:57,50
Passing a row of toilet stalls, we glimpse the bottoms of the porcelain bowls under the partition doors. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS125
00:29:57,00 --> 00:30:04,50
Our view lifts to the bathroom door where the handle begins to turn. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS126
00:30:03,00 --> 00:30:23,50
In her shower stall, SOMEONE runs a hand down her soaked hair. Glistening trails of water glide down her smooth back. She soaps her hands, then washes her stomach. A belly ring shimmers on her navel. As she rubs suds on her wet abdomen, the lights in the bathroom suddenly turn off. She pulls back the shower curtain. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS133
00:31:05,00 --> 00:31:11,50
She stares at its drawn curtain, then steps toward it. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS134
00:31:17,00 --> 00:31:23,50
SOMEONE reaches in and turns off the shower. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS135
00:31:22,00 --> 00:31:32,50
She looks around, her eyes wide. Her body trembles slightly as she gazes out at the seemingly empty bathroom. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS136
00:31:30,00 --> 00:31:39,50
With cautious steps, she moves to the adjacent shower stall and peers at its drawn curtain. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS137
00:31:38,00 --> 00:31:44,50
Stepping up to it, she lifts a hand to the opaque plastic. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS138
00:31:44,00 --> 00:31:50,50
Pulling back the curtain, she finds another vacant stall. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS139
00:31:48,00 --> 00:31:54,50
Water streams from the shower head onto the tile floor. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS140
00:31:53,00 --> 00:32:01,50
SOMEONE turns away from the stall, her hands still clutching its curtain. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS141
00:32:01,00 --> 00:32:08,50
Doffing her towel, she steps back into her shower.  

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS142
00:32:06,00 --> 00:32:11,50
As she washes her hair, a hooded man tears down the curtain and pushes her to the floor. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS144
00:32:37,00 --> 00:32:50,50
Later, in room 316, drops of water fall from the sleeve of SOMEONE's sweatshirt as it hangs from the back of her chair. She sits on her bed, petting Cuddles. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS145
00:32:50,00 --> 00:33:00,50
Hurriedly turning of her bedside lamp, she huddles under her covers. She watches as shadows pass by beneath the door, then sits back up. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS146
00:33:00,00 --> 00:33:07,50
She grabs her phone off her bedside table and hits speed dial. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS147
00:33:09,00 --> 00:33:15,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE hold hands as they step out of the dorm's elevator. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS148
00:33:19,00 --> 00:33:24,50
She smiles as he leans in and kisses her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS149
00:33:23,00 --> 00:33:28,50
Breaking off the kiss, SOMEONE sees her roommate. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS150
00:33:35,00 --> 00:33:41,50
As she storms off, SOMEONE glances at SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS151
00:33:40,00 --> 00:33:46,50
They watch as SOMEONE returns to the room. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS152
00:33:52,00 --> 00:34:02,50
Standing in the elevator, SOMEONE stops the closing door, leans out, and gives her one last kiss. As the door slides shut, SOMEONE 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS153
00:34:01,00 --> 00:34:08,50
The roommates walk through the campus, both staring straight ahead. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS154
00:34:09,00 --> 00:34:14,50
SOMEONE stops her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS155
00:34:17,00 --> 00:34:24,50
As SOMEONE turns away, SOMEONE gently grabs her again. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS156
00:34:25,00 --> 00:34:34,50
Now she opens SOMEONE's profile on a social networking site. A photo is captioned - My best friend SOMEONE and me. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS157
00:34:50,00 --> 00:35:22,50
SOMEONE gives her a good-humored look. Through a plate glass window across the way, we watch the couple at their library table. As SOMEONE stands, our view shifts to show SOMEONE staring at them through the glass. SOMEONE kisses Stephen, then leaves him at the table. Now SOMEONE creeps between two stacks in the library. On the other side of one, SOMEONE searches through books. As he makes his way down the stack, SOMEONE parallels him on the other side, eyeing him through the gaps between the shelves. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS158
00:35:26,00 --> 00:35:35,50
SOMEONE runs his finger along a row of books, examining their spines. SOMEONE stalks him closely. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS159
00:35:37,00 --> 00:35:54,50
Stopping, SOMEONE pulls out a book from a shelf to reveal her watchful eye. Not noticing her, he heads to the end of the aisle, and SOMEONE moves with him, concealed by the bookshelves. Lowering his gaze to his book, SOMEONE obliviously walks past her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS160
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:06,50
He pauses and turns back, but finds no one there. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS161
00:36:06,00 --> 00:36:12,50
Now SOMEONE catches up to SOMEONE on a campus walkway. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS162
00:36:24,00 --> 00:36:28,50
SOMEONE hurries toward them. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS163
00:36:27,00 --> 00:36:31,50
SOMEONE strides away. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS164
00:36:37,00 --> 00:36:43,50
Now SOMEONE and SOMEONE stare at a grand view of downtown. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS165
00:36:51,00 --> 00:36:56,50
She rests her chin on his shoulder. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS166
00:36:55,00 --> 00:37:00,50
SOMEONE glances at her, then smiles. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS167
00:37:26,00 --> 00:37:32,50
Now they hang from a set of monkey bars, their legs bent away from the ground. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS168
00:37:41,00 --> 00:37:46,50
He eyes her bare midriff. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS169
00:37:53,00 --> 00:37:57,50
Grinning, she turns away. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS170
00:37:55,00 --> 00:37:59,50
Later, they kiss heatedly. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS172
00:38:29,00 --> 00:38:33,50
He open the door. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS174
00:38:43,00 --> 00:38:54,50
glances at the door. A clock reads 12:55. SOMEONE stands, grabs her phone, and eyes its display. She throws it onto her bed. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS175
00:38:54,00 --> 00:39:01,50
Turning to SOMEONE's side of the room, she eyes her roommate's bedside table. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS176
00:39:00,00 --> 00:39:08,50
Opening its drawer, she finds SOMEONE's cellphone inside. The caller ID reads - SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS177
00:39:06,00 --> 00:39:12,50
SOMEONE removes the phone and answers. She lifts it to her ear. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS178
00:39:13,00 --> 00:39:18,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE removes SOMEONE's shirt. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS179
00:39:26,00 --> 00:39:34,50
In the dorm room, SOMEONE twitches a smile, then sits on SOMEONE's bed. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS180
00:39:32,00 --> 00:39:38,50
In the frat house, SOMEONE kisses SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS181
00:39:40,00 --> 00:39:49,50
We flash between SOMEONE's room and the dorm. As the couple makes out, SOMEONE lies back on SOMEONE's bed with her eyes closed. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS182
00:39:54,00 --> 00:40:01,50
Holding the phone to her ear, she stares off with a distant look. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS183
00:40:03,00 --> 00:40:12,50
On SOMEONE's bed, her jacket removed and her lover lowers himself on top of her. Meanwhile, SOMEONE's chest heaves. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS184
00:40:11,00 --> 00:40:17,50
She eyes the framed photo of SOMEONE and SOMEONE on the bedside table. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS185
00:40:16,00 --> 00:40:21,50
Her eyes close as she touches herself. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS186
00:40:19,00 --> 00:40:29,50
He presses his lips to Sarah's, then grazes his nose against her cheek. SOMEONE's brow creases in ecstasy, her lips. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS187
00:40:28,00 --> 00:40:34,50
SOMEONE closes her eyes as SOMEONE kisses her neck. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS190
00:40:39,00 --> 00:40:45,50
SOMEONE's lips spread into a sultry expression as she speaks. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS192
00:40:48,00 --> 00:40:52,50
He kisses her neck. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS193
00:40:51,00 --> 00:40:56,50
She smile. SOMEONE gazes at SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS194
00:40:55,00 --> 00:41:00,50
SOMEONE stares off with vacant eyes. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS195
00:41:10,00 --> 00:41:14,50
She hangs up. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS196
00:41:12,00 --> 00:41:16,50
SOMEONE returns to the dorm room. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS197
00:41:30,00 --> 00:41:37,50
Cuddles scurries out to the hall. SOMEONE runs after her. The RA picks up the kitten. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS198
00:41:39,00 --> 00:41:44,50
Taking her, SOMEONE heads away. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS199
00:41:47,00 --> 00:41:52,50
She walks back into her room. Nighttime. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS200
00:42:47,00 --> 00:42:51,50
She brings out another armful of clothes. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS201
00:42:56,00 --> 00:43:02,50
SOMEONE sets down the clothes. SOMEONE eyes her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS202
00:43:10,00 --> 00:43:17,50
Later, SOMEONE scrolls through an online profile, looking at photos of SOMEONE with beautiful women. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS203
00:43:19,00 --> 00:43:24,50
SOMEONE puts away her new clothes. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS204
00:43:32,00 --> 00:43:36,50
She sits beside SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS205
00:43:47,00 --> 00:43:54,50
Staring at Sarah, she clamps her mouth shut, then averts her gaze. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS206
00:43:53,00 --> 00:43:58,50
SOMEONE returns to the closet. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS207
00:43:56,00 --> 00:44:01,50
SOMEONE sulks. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS208
00:43:59,00 --> 00:44:04,50
At work, SOMEONE uses her phone. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS209
00:44:13,00 --> 00:44:26,50
Only a few patrons sit inside the calm coffee house. SOMEONE sets her phone on the counter and lowers her gaze. In the dorm room, SOMEONE carries Cuddles to a laundry basket and sets her on top of some clothes. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS210
00:44:25,00 --> 00:44:31,50
She brings the basket with the kitten into a laundry room. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS211
00:44:30,00 --> 00:44:37,50
Picking up Cuddles, she carries her to a dryer and opens the door. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS212
00:44:36,00 --> 00:44:41,50
She sets her inside. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS213
00:44:39,00 --> 00:44:46,50
As she closes the door, the kitten presses its paw to the glass. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS214
00:44:47,00 --> 00:44:55,50
She feeds coins into the machine. Later, SOMEONE returns to the room to find her crying. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS215
00:44:56,00 --> 00:45:01,50
SOMEONE hugs her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS216
00:45:08,00 --> 00:45:13,50
SOMEONE gives her an irritated look. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS217
00:45:12,00 --> 00:45:21,50
She leaves. Later, SOMEONE picks at a cup of fruit as she sits across from SOMEONE in the cafeteria. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS218
00:45:34,00 --> 00:45:41,50
She gazes intently at her roommate, who glances up from the fruit cup. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS220
00:46:31,00 --> 00:46:37,50
In class, the students pack up their belongings and head out. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS221
00:47:35,00 --> 00:47:41,50
His eyes drift to SOMEONE's lips. He leans in and kisses her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS222
00:47:40,00 --> 00:47:47,50
She recoils, shooting him a disapproving look. He leans back in his seat. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS223
00:47:55,00 --> 00:48:05,50
Now SOMEONE marches down an aisle between library bookcases. Reaching a table, she plops down in a seat facing SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS224
00:48:09,00 --> 00:48:16,50
SOMEONE lowers her disgusted gaze and purses her lips. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS225
00:48:16,00 --> 00:48:21,50
SOMEONE smiles and leans closer to SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS226
00:48:25,00 --> 00:48:31,50
SOMEONE lays a hand on hers. SOMEONE stares at it. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS227
00:48:31,00 --> 00:48:44,50
A pair of feet in seductive high-heeled shoes stride down a hall bathed in dim red light. SOMEONE arrives in the doorway to professor SOMEONEs's office. Putting on a jacket, he pauses. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS228
00:48:47,00 --> 00:48:52,50
SOMEONE enters and shuts the door behind her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS229
00:49:34,00 --> 00:49:41,50
As she picks up a photo, SOMEONE tucks off his wedding ring. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS230
00:50:16,00 --> 00:50:26,50
The professor moves in close. SOMEONE stares at him, then shuts her eyes and parts her lips. The professor gently kisses her mouth. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS231
00:50:29,00 --> 00:50:37,50
He regards her questioningly. SOMEONE puts her fingers to her mouth and gives a Lolita-esque smile. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS232
00:50:37,00 --> 00:50:43,50
With a lustful smirk, SOMEONE kisses her more hungrily. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS233
00:50:59,00 --> 00:51:04,50
a recording device. As he reaches for it 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS234
00:51:14,00 --> 00:51:18,50
SOMEONE kneels down beside the professor. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS235
00:51:20,00 --> 00:51:24,50
Feebly lunges for the recorder, but she moves back. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS236
00:51:32,00 --> 00:51:41,50
She coldly turns away. Daytime. SOMEONE goes to her design class and finds a middle-aged woman at the front. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS237
00:51:52,00 --> 00:51:58,50
SOMEONE turns to a classmate. Later, 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS238
00:52:44,00 --> 00:52:47,50
brings dishes to the counter. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS239
00:53:14,00 --> 00:53:19,50
She kisses her sweetly. SOMEONE smiles. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS240
00:53:47,00 --> 00:53:52,50
She fingers the rosy spot. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS241
00:53:52,00 --> 00:53:58,50
Screwing up her doll-like features, she hits herself again. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS242
00:54:01,00 --> 00:54:12,50
She repeats the process over and over. Later, our lowering gaze takes in a nasty welt on her arm, then bruises on her outer thigh. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS243
00:54:13,00 --> 00:54:41,50
A brief dreamy smile flits across SOMEONE's face. From a jar of art supplies, she takes out a utility knife. Pressing her thumb to a switch on its side, she slides the blade's tip out from its metal handle. SOMEONE lifts up her shirt, revealing her smooth flat abdomen. Her brow furrowed, she puts the knifepoint to the side of her stomach. The troubled young woman closes her eyes, winces, and rips the knifepoint across her flesh. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS244
00:54:40,00 --> 00:54:46,50
Now beneath a photo of a statue depicting a screaming man, she lies on her bed. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS245
00:55:01,00 --> 00:55:06,50
SOMEONE rocks her injured roommate. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS246
00:55:04,00 --> 00:55:10,50
Noticing blood, she gingerly lifts up SOMEONE's shirt. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS247
00:55:34,00 --> 00:55:40,50
SOMEONE lies back down with a miserable pout. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS248
00:55:46,00 --> 00:55:52,50
Daytime. SOMEONE walks outside with SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS249
00:56:03,00 --> 00:56:07,50
They kiss. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS250
00:56:06,00 --> 00:56:17,50
SOMEONE hands her a bag. SOMEONE pulls up in her convertible, and SOMEONE gets in. SOMEONE glances at her and she looks away. Later in the speeding car. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS252
00:56:31,00 --> 00:56:40,50
security gate with a key code panel. A sprawling mansion peeks out from behind lush trees beyond it. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS253
00:56:43,00 --> 00:56:54,50
SOMEONE shifts her uncomfortable gaze. Later, the car passes working gardeners as it travels up a driveway to the gorgeous Greek-style home. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS254
00:56:52,00 --> 00:57:00,50
SOMEONE leads her guest into a sunny foyer. A crystal chandelier hangs from the vaulted ceiling. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS255
00:57:02,00 --> 00:57:09,50
A tall man with thinning hair arrives with a petite elegant redhead. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS256
00:57:08,00 --> 00:57:12,50
He kisses her cheek. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS257
00:57:16,00 --> 00:57:21,50
Her father shifts his uneasy gaze. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS258
00:57:22,00 --> 00:57:28,50
Her parents face SOMEONE tensely. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS259
00:57:39,00 --> 00:57:48,50
SOMEONE leads SOMEONE into a sizable bedroom decorated in shades of gray and periwinkle, and shuts the door. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS260
00:57:50,00 --> 00:58:00,50
SOMEONE crawls onto a luxurious bed and rolls over on her back. SOMEONE steps farther in, taking in her surroundings. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS261
00:58:00,00 --> 00:58:09,50
SOMEONE notices a collection of drawings on a wall. They all feature the same brunette with almond-shaped eyes. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS263
00:58:18,00 --> 00:58:28,50
Now in a dining room, SOMEONE takes a big bite of Thanksgiving turkey, and SOMEONE responds with a warm appreciative smile. Both parents stare at their plates. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS264
00:58:45,00 --> 00:58:52,50
SOMEONE sips his wine and glances at Sarah, who musters a tight smile. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS265
00:58:57,00 --> 00:59:12,50
SOMEONE beams cheerily. Now in the darkened house, SOMEONE comes downstairs in a t-shirt and sweatpants. He lumbers groggily into the kitchen and opens the refrigerator, its light spilling into the room. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS266
00:59:11,00 --> 00:59:15,50
He turns with a start. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS267
00:59:18,00 --> 00:59:34,50
She sits glumly at an island counter. Upstairs, SOMEONE sits up in bed. Later, she arrives downstairs in a camisole and knee-length lounge pants. Crossing the foyer, she peers through the partially open kitchen door. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS268
00:59:36,00 --> 00:59:42,50
SOMEONE sits by his daughter, staring ahead. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS269
00:59:42,00 --> 00:59:47,50
He faces SOMEONE, who stares at the counter. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS270
00:59:47,00 --> 00:59:55,50
The troubled young woman sullenly obeys. SOMEONE lingers at the door, listening intently. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS271
00:59:57,00 --> 01:00:02,50
SOMEONE's brow knits. SOMEONE stands. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS272
01:00:01,00 --> 01:00:13,50
SOMEONE slips out of view. SOMEONE remains at the counter, wearing a morose pout. Daytime. As SOMEONE stands in the foyer, SOMEONE comes in. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS273
01:00:24,00 --> 01:00:29,50
SOMEONE blinks at her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS274
01:00:26,00 --> 01:00:32,50
Upstairs, SOMEONE steps into view. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS275
01:00:31,00 --> 01:00:37,50
SOMEONE leaves as her daughter arrives downstairs. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS276
01:00:34,00 --> 01:00:47,50
SOMEONE gazes after her, then follows SOMEONE out. Later, the two girls follow a sidewalk past a brick wall. Her arms folded across her chest, SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS277
01:00:55,00 --> 01:01:01,50
A smile spreads across SOMEONE's pale face. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS278
01:01:05,00 --> 01:01:09,50
SOMEONE takes a sip. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS279
01:01:08,00 --> 01:01:16,50
Three girls halt at the entrance, their smiles fading. Two of them face their brunette friend. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS280
01:01:16,00 --> 01:01:25,50
SOMEONE follows SOMEONE's gaze to them. As the brunette waits outside, her two friends come in, glaring at SOMEONE as they pass by. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS281
01:01:24,00 --> 01:01:34,50
The troubled blonde glances at the girls as they place their order, then answers her roommate with a cryptic gaze. Looking outside, SOMEONE 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS282
01:01:32,00 --> 01:01:37,50
notices the brunette hunched uneasily at a table. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS283
01:01:37,00 --> 01:01:42,50
The brunette's friends rejoin her with drinks. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS284
01:01:44,00 --> 01:01:53,50
Putting her coffee on the table, she stands and goes outside. The brunette looks up wearily as SOMEONE approaches. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS285
01:01:52,00 --> 01:01:57,50
SOMEONE arrives at her roommate's side. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS286
01:02:00,00 --> 01:02:05,50
SOMEONE offers a gentle smile. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS287
01:02:04,00 --> 01:02:14,50
The three girls huddle uncomfortably, shifting their uneasy gazes. SOMEONE looks up at SOMEONE, who glares resentfully at her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS288
01:02:13,00 --> 01:02:19,50
She smiles meekly at Sarah, and they head off. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS289
01:02:17,00 --> 01:02:22,50
SOMEONE's brow knits. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS290
01:02:20,00 --> 01:02:29,50
The troubled girl pauses and turns back. SOMEONE stands, takes a step closer, and looks her in the eye. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS291
01:02:28,00 --> 01:02:36,50
SOMEONE's faint hopeful smile fades. She stares at SOMEONE, who gravely stands her ground. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS292
01:02:35,00 --> 01:02:43,50
Her eyes glistening, the troubled blonde musters a smug smile, then follows SOMEONE off. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS293
01:02:41,00 --> 01:02:56,50
She speeds down a tree lined street, scattering fallen autumn leaves in its wake. At the wheel, SOMEONE stares ahead with a dull expression. Riding shotgun, SOMEONE maintains a cheery clear-eyed gaze. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS294
01:02:54,00 --> 01:03:00,50
SOMEONE watches her roommate flip open her cellphone. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS295
01:03:00,00 --> 01:03:18,50
woman scowls resentfully at the phone, then eyes her roommate. Now back at the dorm, SOMEONE takes out her ear buds as she walks down the hall in exercise clothes and running shoes. She arrives at her room, sweat glistening on her face and throat. SOMEONE faces her displayed drawings. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS296
01:03:19,00 --> 01:03:24,50
She shoulders her bag and smiles. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS297
01:03:27,00 --> 01:03:32,50
With a sunny grin, SOMEONE leaves. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS298
01:03:30,00 --> 01:03:40,50
SOMEONE notices her sketchpad lying on her bed. Taking an uneasy breath, she approaches the spiral-bound notebook. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS299
01:03:42,00 --> 01:03:46,50
She cheerfully takes it from the bed. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS300
01:03:45,00 --> 01:04:08,50
She leaves again, shutting the door behind her. SOMEONE glances at the bed, then creeps to the door. Opening it, she peers down the hallway. She finds no sign of her roommate. Returning inside, SOMEONE yanks open the drawers of SOMEONE's desk, one after another, anxiously searching their contents. She flips through a couple of sketch pads and finds. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS301
01:04:11,00 --> 01:04:17,50
a yellow prescription pill bottle. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS302
01:04:16,00 --> 01:04:21,50
A hand grabs her shoulder. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS303
01:04:23,00 --> 01:04:27,50
SOMEONE hugs her boyfriend. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS304
01:04:35,00 --> 01:04:46,50
SOMEONE's red convertible pulls into a gas station. Inside, a worker watching a football game spots her through the window and gets up. Outside, SOMEONE 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS305
01:04:44,00 --> 01:04:48,50
She leans to her car's tank. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS306
01:04:47,00 --> 01:04:52,50
The toothpick-chewing attendant approaches. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS307
01:04:52,00 --> 01:04:57,50
Sidling up to her, he leans against the car. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS308
01:04:56,00 --> 01:05:02,50
She forces a smile, then watches him place his hand on her hand. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS309
01:05:08,00 --> 01:05:14,50
caresses her cheek, and she squirts his crotch with gasoline. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS310
01:05:22,00 --> 01:05:26,50
She drops the nozzle. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS311
01:05:25,00 --> 01:05:29,50
She opens a zippo. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS312
01:05:30,00 --> 01:05:34,50
She smiles, and he runs away. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS313
01:05:32,00 --> 01:05:37,50
She caps the lighter. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS314
01:05:35,00 --> 01:05:42,50
Now in the dorm, SOMEONE types Zyprexa into a Wikipedia search field. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS315
01:06:35,00 --> 01:06:43,50
she faces a mirror, rubbing a finger over her lips. SOMEONE enters and stands at the next mirror over to fix her hair. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS316
01:06:49,00 --> 01:06:56,50
As SOMEONE touches up her lip-gloss, she glances at the younger blonde. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS317
01:07:05,00 --> 01:07:10,50
SOMEONE slides in close. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS319
01:07:22,00 --> 01:07:28,50
she slowly bring their lips together for a long soft kiss. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS320
01:07:34,00 --> 01:07:38,50
woman smiles. SOMEONE grins. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS321
01:07:41,00 --> 01:07:46,50
She plays with SOMEONE's hair. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS322
01:08:04,00 --> 01:08:10,50
She hands back the lip-gloss and they leave. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS323
01:08:07,00 --> 01:08:18,50
Daytime. SOMEONE jogs up to SOMEONE's apartment building. At the entrance, she enters a number into an intercom. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS324
01:08:21,00 --> 01:08:36,50
SOMEONE walks out to a curb, then peers up the side of the multi-story building. She glances up and down the street, then adjusts her ear bud and leaves. Now a sideways image shows SOMEONE walking down the dorm hall. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS325
01:08:35,00 --> 01:08:40,50
In their room, SOMEONE sits on her bed. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS326
01:08:51,00 --> 01:08:56,50
SOMEONE sits on her roommate's bed. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS327
01:09:09,00 --> 01:09:22,50
Now the two young women head through a shop selling lots of black clothes and miniskirts. They reach a small tattoo parlor at the back, and face a wall displaying numerous designs. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS328
01:09:24,00 --> 01:09:30,50
SOMEONE walks into a back room with a tattoo artist. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS329
01:09:30,00 --> 01:09:37,50
Sitting on a couch in a waiting area, SOMEONE picks up a magazine and flips through it. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS330
01:09:35,00 --> 01:09:41,50
Later, she drops the magazine and picks up another. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS331
01:09:39,00 --> 01:09:46,50
SOMEONE comes out from the back, her hands clasped at her chest. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS332
01:09:45,00 --> 01:09:50,50
SOMEONE puts down the magazine and stands. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS333
01:09:48,00 --> 01:09:59,50
She faces her smiling friend, who peels back a layer of plastic to reveal a tattoo of the name SOMEONE over her heart. SOMEONE's eyes widen. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS334
01:10:00,00 --> 01:10:05,50
SOMEONE steps back a bit. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS335
01:10:05,00 --> 01:10:12,50
SOMEONE's smile fades. SOMEONE swallows, her eyes glistening with tears. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS336
01:10:39,00 --> 01:10:43,50
He sets down the crate. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS337
01:10:42,00 --> 01:10:50,50
From their dorm room, SOMEONE watches SOMEONE load the crate into the back seat of a taxi. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS338
01:10:51,00 --> 01:10:57,50
SOMEONE enters to find her sitting on the windowsill. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS339
01:10:59,00 --> 01:11:05,50
SOMEONE barely shakes her head no. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS340
01:11:08,00 --> 01:11:13,50
He crouches and opens a drawer. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS341
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:26,50
She takes his picture with her camera. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS342
01:11:29,00 --> 01:11:33,50
Now at the frat house. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS343
01:11:45,00 --> 01:11:49,50
He smells the clothes. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS344
01:11:50,00 --> 01:11:57,50
Unpacks the crate. She finds SOMEONE's brown spiral notebook inside. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS345
01:11:59,00 --> 01:12:04,50
She finds an unfinished drawing of herself. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS346
01:12:03,00 --> 01:12:11,50
Flipping through the subsequent pages, she finds more and more portraits, each more detailed than the last. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS347
01:12:16,00 --> 01:12:31,50
Now we drift high over the intersecting pathways on the quad. SOMEONE nervously glances about as she walks alone down a set of steps. Halfway down, she halts and scans the entire area before continuing on. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS348
01:12:32,00 --> 01:12:39,50
Nighttime. SOMEONE steps out of the coffee shop, then 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS349
01:12:41,00 --> 01:12:49,50
she walks home alone on the dark deserted street. She notices someone walking in her direction. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS350
01:12:48,00 --> 01:12:55,50
SOMEONE squints at the slender hooded figure as the person draws near. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS351
01:12:54,00 --> 01:12:59,50
She averts her gaze as they pass each other. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS352
01:13:00,00 --> 01:13:10,50
As SOMEONE continues on, the hooded figure stops and watches her go. SOMEONE glances back and sees the person walking away. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS353
01:13:09,00 --> 01:13:15,50
Now SOMEONE enters the frat house and shuts the door. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS354
01:13:17,00 --> 01:13:24,50
She finds a group of frat guys playing video games and allows a smile. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS355
01:13:23,00 --> 01:13:29,50
Daytime. In SOMEONE's room, SOMEONE's cellphone vibrates. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS356
01:13:27,00 --> 01:13:31,50
She flips it. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS358
01:13:32,00 --> 01:13:36,50
SOMEONE glances at her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS359
01:13:34,00 --> 01:13:41,50
Outside the dorm building, a guy holds a cellphone to his ear. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS360
01:13:52,00 --> 01:14:03,50
Two students step outside, and SOMEONE hurries over to catch the open door before it shuts. In SOMEONE's room, SOMEONE looks up from her books. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS361
01:14:26,00 --> 01:14:32,50
At the dorm, SOMEONE follows the hallway. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS362
01:14:30,00 --> 01:14:35,50
He stops at room 316 and knocks. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS363
01:14:34,00 --> 01:14:40,50
Inside, we drift backward, away from the door. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS364
01:14:39,00 --> 01:14:45,50
SOMEONE sits in a plain armchair. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS365
01:14:46,00 --> 01:14:54,50
Wearing an anguished frown, she repeatedly stabs the utility knife into the chair's armrest. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS366
01:14:56,00 --> 01:15:00,50
SOMEONE looks up at the door. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS367
01:14:59,00 --> 01:15:05,50
She concentrates on the handle. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS368
01:15:04,00 --> 01:15:18,50
In the hall, SOMEONE jots a note to SOMEONE - I'm here, and I just want to see you. He includes his hotel and room number and signs - Love, SOMEONE. He slips it under the door. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS369
01:15:19,00 --> 01:15:25,50
SOMEONE rises from the armchair and picks up the note. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS370
01:15:25,00 --> 01:15:31,50
At the library, SOMEONE takes notes as she studies. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS373
01:15:43,00 --> 01:15:54,50
Later, she opens SOMEONE's wardrobe, then grabs a bottle of SOMEONE's perfume. Looking at herself in the mirror, she puts on SOMEONE's fedora. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS374
01:15:52,00 --> 01:16:06,50
She strokes the SOMEONE tattoo, which peeks over her black SOMEONE bra. Now SOMEONE opens a wide bureau drawer containing only SOMEONE's necklace. She fastens the chain around her neck. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS375
01:16:04,00 --> 01:16:15,50
Later still, at the Rosewell Hotel, a chambermaid pushes a supply cart down a hallway. SOMEONE exits the elevator dressed like SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS376
01:16:13,00 --> 01:16:19,50
She watches the maid unlock a door down the hall. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS377
01:16:17,00 --> 01:16:25,50
As the maid tends to the room, SOMEONE crosses to the cart and steals a key card off of it. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS378
01:16:23,00 --> 01:16:31,50
Now outside room 210, SOMEONE inserts the card into the electronic slot on the door. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS379
01:16:30,00 --> 01:16:36,50
Inside, SOMEONE sleeps soundly. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS380
01:16:36,00 --> 01:16:48,50
SOMEONE slides into the room and shuts the door behind her. As she removes her black sleeveless top, SOMEONE remains asleep on his side, his back to her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS381
01:16:46,00 --> 01:16:51,50
SOMEONE slides off her jeans. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS382
01:16:52,00 --> 01:16:58,50
She eases into bed behind him and gets under the comforter. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS383
01:16:58,00 --> 01:17:03,50
She rubs his shoulder and kisses his back. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS384
01:17:12,00 --> 01:17:17,50
He smiles, his eyes still closed. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS385
01:17:18,00 --> 01:17:25,50
The bleary-eyed young man glimpses SOMEONE's necklace and familiar tattoo. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS386
01:17:26,00 --> 01:17:33,50
She pulls the utility knife from her bra strap and raises it. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS387
01:17:33,00 --> 01:17:44,50
SOMEONE opens his eyes, SOMEONE plunges the knife downward. She stabs him again. SOMEONE's head presses to his pillow, then his wide eyes go lifeless. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS388
01:17:44,00 --> 01:17:54,50
At the library, SOMEONE packs up her books. She receives a text message from SOMEONE - Urgent, I need you right away. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS389
01:18:20,00 --> 01:18:27,50
At SOMEONE's posh apartment building, SOMEONE crosses the lobby. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS390
01:18:28,00 --> 01:18:33,50
The door slides open and she steps in the elevator and hits number six.  

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS391
01:18:32,00 --> 01:18:41,50
Her gaze drifts to the digital display as it counts upward. SOMEONE waits with a faint smile. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS392
01:18:41,00 --> 01:18:57,50
Now the door slides open, and SOMEONE steps into a hallway. She pauses in front of SOMEONE's apartment as she finds the door ajar. A sign on it reads - Entre des artist. With a puzzled look, SOMEONE peeks inside. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS393
01:19:01,00 --> 01:19:07,50
Pushing the door all the way open, she walks into the dark apartment. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS394
01:19:07,00 --> 01:19:14,50
As she heads down a hall, she pulls her phone from her bag and checks it. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS395
01:19:12,00 --> 01:19:19,50
Sheer curtains at the end of the hall billow in front of an open window. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS396
01:19:16,00 --> 01:19:32,50
Turning a corner, SOMEONE narrows her eyes as she heads toward SOMEONE's bedroom. Its door hangs partially open as well. SOMEONE draws closer, and finds the bedside lamp on and the comforter on the bed rumpled. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS397
01:19:30,00 --> 01:19:36,50
She opens the door wider and steps into the room. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS398
01:19:37,00 --> 01:19:42,50
SOMEONE aims a revolver at her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS399
01:19:43,00 --> 01:19:49,50
SOMEONE sits. SOMEONE kneels in front of her. She touches SOMEONE's hair. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS400
01:19:49,00 --> 01:19:54,50
she glances at her restrained friend. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS401
01:20:01,00 --> 01:20:05,50
Point blank at SOMEONE's head. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS403
01:20:41,00 --> 01:20:48,50
SOMEONE smiles tearfully. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS404
01:20:58,00 --> 01:21:03,50
She shakes out a plastic bag. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS406
01:21:34,00 --> 01:21:38,50
She went out of the room searching for the weapon.  

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS407
01:21:37,00 --> 01:21:42,50
SOMEONE closes and locks SOMEONE's bedroom. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS409
01:22:20,00 --> 01:22:24,50
SOMEONE reaches for the fire escape. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS411
01:23:00,00 --> 01:23:03,50
He pulled her back through the window. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS412
01:23:10,00 --> 01:23:14,50
SOMEONE smiles down at her. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS413
01:23:13,00 --> 01:23:17,50
He hauls her up. As they both fell down. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS414
01:23:21,00 --> 01:23:26,50
approaching and grabs the gun from SOMEONE's waist. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS415
01:23:25,00 --> 01:23:30,50
She smiles and reaches out. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS416
01:23:30,00 --> 01:23:35,50
SOMEONE grips the gun with both hands. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS417
01:23:36,00 --> 01:23:42,50
She flinches, her smile vanishing. SOMEONE squeezes the trigger again. SOMEONE gives a dejected pout. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS418
01:23:41,00 --> 01:23:46,50
SOMEONE stands, with the gun still in her hand. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS420
01:24:13,00 --> 01:24:17,50
She resists desperately.  

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS421
01:24:21,00 --> 01:24:25,50
SOMEONE leans over SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS422
01:24:28,00 --> 01:24:33,50
She stabs SOMEONE in the back with a utility knife. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS423
01:24:31,00 --> 01:24:36,50
SOMEONE drops to her knees. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS424
01:24:35,00 --> 01:24:42,50
She reaches backward, her fingers straining for the knife. She topples onto her side. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS425
01:24:41,00 --> 01:24:53,50
SOMEONE looks over at SOMEONE. Still bound to the bed, the young woman stares down at the fallen killer. With a wince, SOMEONE sits up partway. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS426
01:24:55,00 --> 01:25:02,50
She strains to move herself along on her arms, and fixes her eyes on SOMEONE. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS427
01:24:59,00 --> 01:25:08,50
She leans in and reaches a hand toward SOMEONE's necklace, still worn by the motionless psychopath. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS428
01:25:06,00 --> 01:25:14,50
Holding her breath, SOMEONE inches her fingers closer, almost touching the necklace. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS429
01:25:14,00 --> 01:25:20,50
SOMEONE opens her eyes and grabs SOMEONE's wrist. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS430
01:25:19,00 --> 01:25:23,50
her chest heaves. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS431
01:25:24,00 --> 01:25:33,50
SOMEONE's eyelids droop, and her eyes roll back in her head. SOMEONE yanks her wrist from the dead woman's grasp. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS432
01:25:35,00 --> 01:25:51,50
SOMEONE clutches SOMEONE's necklace in her hand and gives it a tug. The chain gives, and she retrieves it from SOMEONE's neck. With a final look at her ex-roommate, SOMEONE crawls over to SOMEONE. He stirs as she lies down beside him. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS433
01:25:54,00 --> 01:26:09,50
Draping an arm across his chest, she rests her head on his shoulder, and he places his hand on her head. Daytime. A clear blue sky sprawls above SOMEONE as she stops in front of her dorm, gazes at it, then heads inside. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS434
01:26:13,00 --> 01:26:24,50
SOMEONE enters room 316, its walls now bare and its contents packed in suitcases and boxes. She slides a duffle bag off her shoulder. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS435
01:26:26,00 --> 01:26:36,50
Sitting on her bare bed, she scans SOMEONE's former half of the room. With a pained expression, she lowers her gaze. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS436
01:26:35,00 --> 01:26:40,50
SOMEONE enters. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS437
01:26:48,00 --> 01:26:53,50
He turns to leave. 

THE_ROOMMATE_DVS438
01:26:53,00 --> 01:26:59,50
Now SOMEONE drags the extra bed out of her room.
