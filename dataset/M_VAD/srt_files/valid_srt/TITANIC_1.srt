00:47:51,00 --> 00:48:01,50
SOMEONE's eyes widen as the huge funnel tips over. Swimming in the water with several others, SOMEONE looks up as the giant funnel falls on to him. 

TITANIC_1_DVS397
00:48:02,00 --> 00:48:12,50

TITANIC_1_DVS398
00:48:12,00 --> 00:48:20,50

Some people in the lifeboat behind the Titanic 

TITANIC_1_DVS403
00:48:54,00 --> 00:49:00,50

TITANIC_1_DVS407
00:49:29,00 --> 00:49:40,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE continue on, pressing past a group of people kneeling around a priest. A few dozen people tread water near the propellers, which have now risen completely out of the water. 

TITANIC_1_DVS408
00:49:41,00 --> 00:49:54,50
SOMEONE pulls SOMEONE up the poop deck, which is now slanted at about a 45-degree angle. They grab onto the railing at the exact spot they first met. Water streams down the exposed propellers as they continue to tilt upward.

00:49:56,00 --> 00:50:05,50
Several kneeling people grab one of the priest's hand as he holds on to a capstan or rotating shaft with his other hand.

00:50:03,00 --> 00:50:08,50
Beside SOMEONE and SOMEONE, a woman hugs a young boy to her chest. 

TITANIC_1_DVS411
00:50:09,00 --> 00:50:17,50
Shivering, SOMEONE clings to SOMEONE as she looks down at the sinking ship. His breath smokes in the cold air. 

TITANIC_1_DVS412
00:50:27,00 --> 00:50:33,50
SOMEONE smiles. SOMEONE hugs her tight and kisses her forehead. 

TITANIC_1_DVS413
00:50:49,00 --> 00:51:00,50
Inside a submerged portion of the ship, a woman's lifeless body drifts beneath a large chandelier. Her gauzy dress billowing in the currents. 

TITANIC_1_DVS414
00:50:57,00 --> 00:51:03,50
Elsewhere, stacks of plates slide off their shelves and smash on the floor. 

TITANIC_1_DVS416
00:51:07,00 --> 00:51:15,50
A lifeboat full of people rows away from the rear of the ship, which rises several stories into the night sky. 

TITANIC_1_DVS417
00:51:12,00 --> 00:51:17,50
People slide down the slanted deck.

00:51:45,00 --> 00:51:51,50
Several people climb over the railing at the back of the ship. 

TITANIC_1_DVS423
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:56,50
One man jumps and free falls into the icy water, where small groups of survivors cling to floating SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_1_DVS424
00:51:54,00 --> 00:52:03,50
Standing at the rear railing, the black-haired baker watches a falling man bounce off of one of the giant propellers and cartwheel into the sea. 

TITANIC_1_DVS425
00:52:01,00 --> 00:52:06,50
The baker pulls a flask out of his pocket and takes a drink. 

TITANIC_1_DVS426
00:52:04,00 --> 00:52:10,50
SOMEONE wraps his arms around SOMEONE as she grips on to the railing. 

TITANIC_1_DVS427
00:52:11,00 --> 00:52:18,50
Sitting beside SOMEONE in a lifeboat, SOMEONE's eyes are glassy as she watches from a distance. 

TITANIC_1_DVS428
00:52:28,00 --> 00:52:35,50
Also in a lifeboat SOMEONE turns away from the carnage and squeezes his eyes shut. 

TITANIC_1_DVS429
00:52:37,00 --> 00:52:44,50
In the engine room, a crewman reaches towards a sparking circuit breaker. A shock flings him backward. 

TITANIC_1_DVS432
00:52:44,00 --> 00:52:50,50
All along the Titanic, electric lights flicker then go out. 

TITANIC_1_DVS433
00:52:47,00 --> 00:52:54,50
As the rear of the ship continues to tilt upward, the deck boards splinter and snap. 

TITANIC_1_DVS434
00:52:53,00 --> 00:53:00,50
Blood streaming down his forehead, SOMEONE grips a side railing as it splits apart. 

TITANIC_1_DVS435
00:52:58,00 --> 00:53:04,50
Inside the ship, a ceiling collapses as several support columns fail. 

TITANIC_1_DVS436
00:53:02,00 --> 00:53:13,50
A crack opens down the side of the Titanic. Small explosion shoot flames from portholes. A pair of men slides into the widen chasm, opening in the middle of the deck. 

TITANIC_1_DVS437
00:53:13,00 --> 00:53:20,50
The mighty ship snaps in half, sending the rear of the boat plunging back toward the sea. 

TITANIC_1_DVS438
00:53:19,00 --> 00:53:27,50
The back of the Titanic slaps down on the ocean surface crushing dozens of people treading in the water. 

TITANIC_1_DVS440
00:53:27,00 --> 00:53:39,50
The impact causes water to spray up in all directions. The last of the funnels topples over as water rushes into the gap between the two sections, which are still joined at the bottom. 

TITANIC_1_DVS441
00:53:39,00 --> 00:53:48,50
As the front half of the Titanic rapidly fills with water and sinks, it pulls the back half into the air again. 

TITANIC_1_DVS442
00:53:49,00 --> 00:53:55,50
People slide and topple down the slanting deck.

SOMEONE and a few other passengers manage to scramble over the railing as the ship tips completely vertical. 

TITANIC_1_DVS446
00:54:20,00 --> 00:54:29,50
Sheets of water glimmer in the moonlight as they run down the exposed hull, which rises up from the ocean like a tower. 

TITANIC_1_DVS447
00:54:29,00 --> 00:54:35,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE lie on their stomachs and stare straight down the deck. 

TITANIC_1_DVS448
00:54:45,00 --> 00:54:50,50
People dangling from railings, lose their grips and fall. 

TITANIC_1_DVS449
00:54:49,00 --> 00:54:56,50
One man bounces off a capstan before slamming into other people hanging on below, 

TITANIC_1_DVS450
00:54:54,00 --> 00:54:59,50
creating a domino effect of falling bodies. 

TITANIC_1_DVS451
00:54:58,00 --> 00:55:07,50
A blonde maid dangles from the railing near SOMEONE, who looks into the young woman's eyes as she loses her grip and falls. 

TITANIC_1_DVS452
00:55:06,00 --> 00:55:13,50
Her breath visible in the cold air, SOMEONE turns to the baker who crouches on the railing beside her. 

TITANIC_1_DVS453
00:55:10,00 --> 00:55:15,50
He returns her silent gaze. 

TITANIC_1_DVS454
00:55:12,00 --> 00:55:17,50
The entire ship sinks downward again. 

TITANIC_1_DVS455
00:55:15,00 --> 00:55:22,50
Rising air pressure blows water out of compartments and windows as they become submerged. 

TITANIC_1_DVS456
00:55:23,00 --> 00:55:29,50
The ocean roils around the ship as it sinks deeper. 

TITANIC_1_DVS457
00:55:26,00 --> 00:55:34,50
Dozens of passenger still dangle from poles or lie against railings and staircases on the vertical deck.

TITANIC_1_DVS461
00:56:00,00 --> 00:56:05,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hold hands as they kneel beside one another. 

TITANIC_1_DVS462
00:56:09,00 --> 00:56:16,50
SOMEONE nods as the bubbling water covers the tail rudder and surges up the poop deck. 

TITANIC_1_DVS463
00:56:20,00 --> 00:56:27,50
Waves swirl around the name Titanic written across the ship in gold lettering. 

TITANIC_1_DVS464
00:56:29,00 --> 00:56:36,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE take deep gulps of air as the tail end of the ship sinks beneath the surface. 

TITANIC_1_DVS465
00:56:37,00 --> 00:56:44,50
Underwater, SOMEONE and SOMEONE hold hands as they tumble in the jostling currents. 

TITANIC_1_DVS466
00:56:41,00 --> 00:56:47,50
The ship sinks into the murky depths and vanishes. 

TITANIC_1_DVS467
00:56:49,00 --> 00:56:55,50
SOMEONE grabs on to SOMEONE's life vest but is swept away by the turbulence. 

TITANIC_1_DVS468
00:56:53,00 --> 00:57:00,50
SOMEONE kicks to the surface and emerges amid other flailing survivors. 

TITANIC_1_DVS469
00:57:25,00 --> 00:57:31,50
For at least a quarter mile, the ocean churns with panicked swimmers. 

TITANIC_1_DVS470
00:57:30,00 --> 00:57:36,50
Two men try to grab onto a bobbing barrel which spins out of their grasps. 

TITANIC_1_DVS471
00:57:35,00 --> 00:57:40,50
SOMEONE swims through the mass of people. 

TITANIC_1_DVS472
00:57:40,00 --> 00:57:48,50
One man grabs on to SOMEONE and shoves her underwater as he tries to climb on top of her. 

TITANIC_1_DVS473
00:57:53,00 --> 00:57:59,50
SOMEONE punches the hysterical man in the face until he releases SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_1_DVS474
00:58:00,00 --> 00:58:05,50
SOMEONE tows SOMEONE by her life vest. 

TITANIC_1_DVS475
00:58:12,00 --> 00:58:17,50
They swim out of the mass of survivors. 

TITANIC_1_DVS476
00:58:23,00 --> 00:58:29,50
SOMEONE leads her to a flat piece of wood floating on the surface. 

TITANIC_1_DVS477
00:58:29,00 --> 00:58:35,50
SOMEONE pulls herself on to the elaborately carved panel. 

TITANIC_1_DVS479
00:58:39,00 --> 00:58:45,50
Tries to pull himself on to the panel as well but it tips under their combined weight. 

TITANIC_1_DVS481
00:58:51,00 --> 00:58:57,50
SOMEONE holds on to the panel as he floats in the water beside her. 

TITANIC_1_DVS482
00:58:54,00 --> 00:58:59,50
SOMEONE looks down and blinks and nods to himself. 

TITANIC_1_DVS483
00:58:59,00 --> 00:59:07,50
Lying on her stomach on the panel, SOMEONE moves toward SOMEONE and leans her forehead against his. 

TITANIC_1_DVS484
00:59:06,00 --> 00:59:12,50
Their breath is visible in the cold air. He takes her hand. 

TITANIC_1_DVS485
00:59:28,00 --> 00:59:35,50
Clinging to a nearby piece of debris, a crewman blows into a whistle. 

TITANIC_1_DVS486
00:59:42,00 --> 00:59:48,50
SOMEONE's blue lips tremble as she smiles weakly. 

TITANIC_1_DVS487
00:59:50,00 --> 00:59:56,50
Sitting in a lifeboat beside SOMEONE, SOMEONE closes her eyes. 

TITANIC_1_DVS488
01:00:15,00 --> 01:00:22,50
Furrowing her brow, SOMEONE looks around at the other people in the boat who avert their gaze. 

TITANIC_1_DVS489
01:00:29,00 --> 01:00:33,50
A young woman sobs. 

TITANIC_1_DVS490
01:00:38,00 --> 01:00:43,50
SOMEONE glares at the crewman then sits. 

TITANIC_1_DVS491
01:00:43,00 --> 01:00:49,50
Beside her, SOMEONE presses her hands over her own ears. 

TITANIC_1_DVS492
01:00:46,00 --> 01:00:53,50
Elsewhere, survivors in four lifeboats work to lash the vessels together. 

TITANIC_1_DVS493
01:01:04,00 --> 01:01:11,50
A dark-haired crewman supervising the operation glances back toward the side of the wreck. 

TITANIC_1_DVS494
01:01:19,00 --> 01:01:26,50
Still clinging to wreckage, the crewman with the whistle in his mouth floats motionless with his eyes closed. 

TITANIC_1_DVS495
01:01:24,00 --> 01:01:31,50
Swimming a few yards away, SOMEONE stares at the man then turns toward SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_1_DVS496
01:01:50,00 --> 01:01:55,50
SOMEONE's lips tremble as she stares at SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_1_DVS497
01:03:11,00 --> 01:03:17,50
Ice crystal sparkle in SOMEONE's hair as he takes her hand. 

TITANIC_1_DVS498
01:03:58,00 --> 01:04:02,50
He kisses the back of her hand. 

TITANIC_1_DVS499
01:04:00,00 --> 01:04:05,50
SOMEONE smiles, then closes his eyes and winces. 

TITANIC_1_DVS500
01:04:03,00 --> 01:04:09,50
SOMEONE closes her eyes and leans her head against their entwined hands. 

TITANIC_1_DVS501
01:04:11,00 --> 01:04:20,50
As one lifeboat returns to the side of the wreck, the dark-haired crewman shines his flashlight over the SOMEONE stream water. 

TITANIC_1_DVS502
01:04:21,00 --> 01:04:28,50
Frozen bodies float in mid pieces of furniture, barrels, and other wreckage. 

TITANIC_1_DVS503
01:04:35,00 --> 01:04:41,50
Using an oar, the crewman prods several stiff corpses. 

TITANIC_1_DVS504
01:04:49,00 --> 01:04:57,50
Leaning over the front of the boat, a sailor pushes bodies out of their path as they row forward slowly. 

TITANIC_1_DVS505
01:05:11,00 --> 01:05:18,50
The crewman's flashlight beam illuminates a dead woman and infant floating in the water. 

TITANIC_1_DVS506
01:05:41,00 --> 01:05:49,50
Elsewhere in the SOMEONE field, SOMEONE lies on her back atop the floating wooden panel. 

TITANIC_1_DVS507
01:05:46,00 --> 01:05:53,50
SOMEONE floats in the sea beside her. His head and arms propped above water. 

TITANIC_1_DVS508
01:06:04,00 --> 01:06:10,50
SOMEONE sings to herself as she gazes up at the starry night sky. 

TITANIC_1_DVS509
01:06:16,00 --> 01:06:21,50
Her hair and eyebrows caked with ice, 

TITANIC_1_DVS510
01:06:19,00 --> 01:06:25,50
SOMEONE turns her head as a distant light illuminates the side of her face. 

TITANIC_1_DVS511
01:06:28,00 --> 01:06:34,50
The lifeboat passes several yards away from her. 

TITANIC_1_DVS512
01:06:34,00 --> 01:06:38,50
She shakes SOMEONE's hand. 

TITANIC_1_DVS513
01:06:41,00 --> 01:06:47,50
Smiling, SOMEONE rubs SOMEONE's arm then sits up. 

TITANIC_1_DVS514
01:06:47,00 --> 01:06:52,50
He floats motionless with his eyes closed. 

TITANIC_1_DVS515
01:06:51,00 --> 01:06:57,50
She shakes him harder, then gazes toward the lifeboat. 

TITANIC_1_DVS516
01:06:54,00 --> 01:07:00,50
Between them, the dead crewman floats with the whistle still in his mouth. 

TITANIC_1_DVS517
01:07:04,00 --> 01:07:09,50
SOMEONE's smile fades as she stares at SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_1_DVS518
01:07:07,00 --> 01:07:11,50
She shakes him again. 

TITANIC_1_DVS519
01:07:22,00 --> 01:07:27,50
A tear trickles down her nose. 

TITANIC_1_DVS520
01:07:35,00 --> 01:07:42,50
Furrowing her brow, SOMEONE chokes back tears as she strokes SOMEONE's hand. 

TITANIC_1_DVS521
01:07:42,00 --> 01:07:47,50
The lifeboat rows farther away. 

TITANIC_1_DVS522
01:07:47,00 --> 01:07:52,50
SOMEONE trembles as she watches it recede. 

TITANIC_1_DVS523
01:07:50,00 --> 01:07:55,50
She lays down her head and closes her eyes. 

TITANIC_1_DVS524
01:07:59,00 --> 01:08:05,50
The light of the rescuers' flashlights grow dimmer as they move on. 

TITANIC_1_DVS525
01:08:10,00 --> 01:08:15,50
SOMEONE's eyes pop open. 

TITANIC_1_DVS527
01:08:47,00 --> 01:08:52,50
SOMEONE pries her hand out of SOMEONE's grip. 

TITANIC_1_DVS528
01:08:57,00 --> 01:09:02,50
She kisses his hand then releases him. 

TITANIC_1_DVS529
01:09:00,00 --> 01:09:05,50
SOMEONE sinks into the icy water and vanishes in the gloom. 

TITANIC_1_DVS530
01:09:10,00 --> 01:09:17,50
SOMEONE slides on her stomach to the edge of the platform then rolls into the water. 

TITANIC_1_DVS531
01:09:18,00 --> 01:09:26,50
Her breath steaming out in cloud, SOMEONE swims to the frozen crewman and pulls the whistle from his lips. 

TITANIC_1_DVS532
01:09:42,00 --> 01:09:49,50
SOMEONE continues to blow into the whistle as the rescuers shine their lights on her. 

TITANIC_1_DVS533
01:09:55,00 --> 01:10:02,50
On the research ship, the now older SOMEONE opens her eyes. 

TITANIC_1_DVS534
01:10:22,00 --> 01:10:27,50
Tears stream down SOMEONE's face. 

TITANIC_1_DVS535
01:10:56,00 --> 01:11:01,50
As dawn breaks over the ocean. 

TITANIC_1_DVS536
01:10:58,00 --> 01:11:04,50
SOMEONE sits silently in a lifeboat with other survivors. 

TITANIC_1_DVS537
01:11:02,00 --> 01:11:08,50
In another boat, a man takes a drink from a flask then passes it to SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_1_DVS538
01:11:10,00 --> 01:11:17,50
Elsewhere, SOMEONE huddles against SOMEONE, who stares out to the sea with a blank expression. 

TITANIC_1_DVS539
01:11:14,00 --> 01:11:21,50
In another lifeboat, SOMEONE lies wrapped in a blanket, her face pale. 

TITANIC_1_DVS542
01:11:21,00 --> 01:11:27,50
Standing over her, the dark-haired crewman waves a green flare. 

TITANIC_1_DVS543
01:11:29,00 --> 01:11:35,50
As pink hues tinge the sky along the horizon, lifeboats row toward a waiting ship anchored amid floating icebergs. 

TITANIC_1_DVS548
01:11:44,00 --> 01:11:49,50
Nestled in her blanket, SOMEONE opens her eyes as they row up alongside the ship Carpathia.  

TITANIC_1_DVS551
01:11:51,00 --> 01:11:56,50
Later, Titanic survivors, mostly women and children, recover on one of the ship's lower decks, as nurses and crewmen flit amongst them.  

TITANIC_1_DVS552
01:11:54,00 --> 01:11:58,50
Still dressed in a tuxedo, SOMEONE walks down a staircase onto the lower deck. 

TITANIC_1_DVS553
01:12:04,00 --> 01:12:09,50
SOMEONE brushes pass the man then walks amid the survivors. 

TITANIC_1_DVS555
01:12:22,00 --> 01:12:27,50
SOMEONE sits on a bench with the blanket wrapped around her hooding her hair and head. 

TITANIC_1_DVS556
01:12:24,00 --> 01:12:30,50
She glances up at SOMEONE's back as he surveys the passengers. 

TITANIC_1_DVS557
01:12:30,00 --> 01:12:35,50
SOMEONE looks away as he turns toward her. 

TITANIC_1_DVS558
01:12:32,00 --> 01:12:38,50
She closes her eyes as SOMEONE paces behind her. 

TITANIC_1_DVS559
01:12:39,00 --> 01:12:45,50
SOMEONE peers sideways at SOMEONE as he walks away. 

TITANIC_1_DVS560
01:12:59,00 --> 01:13:05,50
Her hair wet and stringy, SOMEONE stands in pouring rain on the deck of the ship. 

TITANIC_1_DVS561
01:13:03,00 --> 01:13:08,50
She stares up at the Statue of Liberty. 

TITANIC_1_DVS562
01:13:05,00 --> 01:13:10,50
The torch and crown glowing in the night. 

TITANIC_1_DVS563
01:13:08,00 --> 01:13:13,50
A ship's crewman holding a clipboard steps up to SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_1_DVS564
01:13:23,00 --> 01:13:30,50
SOMEONE continues to stare up at the giant statue as the crewman moves on. 

TITANIC_1_DVS565
01:13:45,00 --> 01:13:49,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

TITANIC_1_DVS566
01:14:12,00 --> 01:14:19,50
On the ocean floor, the two submersible shine their lights on the Titanic's remains. 

TITANIC_1_DVS567
01:14:19,00 --> 01:14:25,50
The submersibles rise leaving the wreck in darkness. 

TITANIC_1_DVS568
01:14:31,00 --> 01:14:37,50
At the surface, crewman work to recover the submersibles. 

TITANIC_1_DVS569
01:14:39,00 --> 01:14:47,50
Standing with SOMEONE on the research ship, Brock sniffs a cigar then throws it into the water. 

TITANIC_1_DVS570
01:15:05,00 --> 01:15:11,50
Staring at Brock, SOMEONE smiles and shakes her head. 

TITANIC_1_DVS571
01:15:08,00 --> 01:15:15,50
He turns and watches lights glint off the surface of rolling waves. 

TITANIC_1_DVS572
01:15:17,00 --> 01:15:22,50
Later that night, wearing only a nightgown, 

TITANIC_1_DVS573
01:15:19,00 --> 01:15:25,50
SOMEONE walks barefoot across the desolate deck. 

TITANIC_1_DVS574
01:15:22,00 --> 01:15:27,50
Her lose white hair blows in the wind. 

TITANIC_1_DVS575
01:15:35,00 --> 01:15:39,50
Clutching her hands over her heart. 

TITANIC_1_DVS576
01:15:37,00 --> 01:15:42,50
SOMEONE walks to a railing at the back of the ship. 

TITANIC_1_DVS577
01:15:54,00 --> 01:15:59,50
She grips the railing with one hand. 

TITANIC_1_DVS578
01:15:56,00 --> 01:16:01,50
And pulls herself up onto the bottom rung. 

TITANIC_1_DVS579
01:16:03,00 --> 01:16:09,50
Smiling, she stares down into the water. 

TITANIC_1_DVS580
01:16:13,00 --> 01:16:19,50
She unclasps her left hand, revealing the Heart of the Ocean. 

TITANIC_1_DVS581
01:16:17,00 --> 01:16:23,50
The large heart-shaped blue diamond glints in the moonlight. 

TITANIC_1_DVS582
01:16:20,00 --> 01:16:28,50
On the deck of the Carpathia, young SOMEONE stands in the rain and stares at the Statue of Liberty. 

TITANIC_1_DVS583
01:16:26,00 --> 01:16:30,50
Frowning, she looks down. 

TITANIC_1_DVS584
01:16:27,00 --> 01:16:33,50
And pulls the Heart of the Ocean out of her jacket pocket. 

TITANIC_1_DVS586
01:16:34,00 --> 01:16:39,50
Back on the deck of the Keldysh, SOMEONE has the diamond necklace in her hand. 

TITANIC_1_DVS587
01:16:41,00 --> 01:16:45,50
As the necklace sinks. 

TITANIC_1_DVS588
01:16:43,00 --> 01:16:48,50
SOMEONE smiles and exhales deeply.
