A dolphin swims ahead of the ship. 

TITANIC_2_DVS177
00:31:39,00 --> 00:31:43,50
Other dolphins join the first one. 

TITANIC_2_DVS178
00:31:45,00 --> 00:31:52,50
The dolphins zoom through the clear water like zigzagging torpedoes. 

TITANIC_2_DVS179
00:31:54,00 --> 00:31:58,50
One dolphin leaps out of the water. 

TITANIC_2_DVS180
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:08,50
SOMEONE smiles as he gazes down at the dolphins. Behind them, a crewmember hands a teacup to Captain SOMEONE.

Meanwhile, SOMEONE, SOMEONE, and SOMEONE lunch with several guests, including SOMEONE Brown and a brown-haired man with a mustache.

TITANIC_2_DVS201
00:36:02,00 --> 00:36:07,50
She peeks toward him from the corner of her eyes. 

TITANIC_2_DVS202
00:36:04,00 --> 00:36:10,50

TITANIC_2_DVS213
00:37:50,00 --> 00:37:55,50
She gazes down at the churning waters of the ship's wake. 

TITANIC_2_DVS214
00:37:57,00 --> 00:38:04,50
Slowly, she places her hands on the railing then climbs onto its first rung. 

TITANIC_2_DVS215
00:38:06,00 --> 00:38:13,50
Holding on to a flagpole, she swings her feet over the railing one at a time, 

TITANIC_2_DVS216
00:38:10,00 --> 00:38:15,50
then lowers herself onto the gunwale. 

TITANIC_2_DVS217
00:38:18,00 --> 00:38:25,50
Gripping the railing for support, SOMEONE turns and faces the water. 

TITANIC_2_DVS218
00:38:23,00 --> 00:38:29,50
The wind whips her curly, auburn hair around her face. 

TITANIC_2_DVS219
00:38:27,00 --> 00:38:31,50

TITANIC_2_DVS600
01:25:18,00 --> 01:25:22,50
SOMEONE smiles. 

TITANIC_2_DVS601
01:25:25,00 --> 01:25:30,50
SOMEONE steps toward SOMEONE. He sits back. 

TITANIC_2_DVS602
01:25:29,00 --> 01:25:34,50
She tosses a dime to SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_2_DVS603
01:25:34,00 --> 01:25:40,50
SOMEONE steps backward, then slips the kimono from her shoulders. 

TITANIC_2_DVS604
01:25:40,00 --> 01:25:44,50
The kimono slides to the floor. 

TITANIC_2_DVS605
01:25:44,00 --> 01:25:50,50
Naked, SOMEONE runs her fingertips over her own thigh. 

TITANIC_2_DVS606
01:25:49,00 --> 01:25:53,50
SOMEONE points toward the settee. 

TITANIC_2_DVS607
01:25:55,00 --> 01:26:00,50
SOMEONE steps to the settee.  

TITANIC_2_DVS608
01:26:05,00 --> 01:26:10,50
Then stretches out on settee, SOMEONE drapes one arm along the back of the settee. 

TITANIC_2_DVS609
01:26:12,00 --> 01:26:17,50
SOMEONE lays her hand on the pillow behind her head. 

TITANIC_2_DVS610
01:26:18,00 --> 01:26:23,50
She places her right hand near her temple. 

TITANIC_2_DVS611
01:26:23,00 --> 01:26:28,50
Smiling, SOMEONE lowers her head. 

TITANIC_2_DVS612
01:26:32,00 --> 01:26:36,50
SOMEONE licks her lips. 

TITANIC_2_DVS613
01:26:37,00 --> 01:26:42,50
SOMEONE peers over the top of his sketchpad, then draws a line. 

TITANIC_2_DVS614
01:26:43,00 --> 01:26:49,50
Looking from the paper to SOMEONE, he sketches. 

TITANIC_2_DVS615
01:26:52,00 --> 01:26:57,50
SOMEONE grins as he draws. 

TITANIC_2_DVS616
01:26:54,00 --> 01:26:59,50
He runs his charcoal across the paper, creating faint arcs. 

TITANIC_2_DVS618
01:26:58,00 --> 01:27:03,50
He jerks his head to toss his hair out of his eyes. 

TITANIC_2_DVS619
01:27:01,00 --> 01:27:06,50
He adds details as he flushes out the sketch. 

TITANIC_2_DVS620
01:27:37,00 --> 01:27:43,50
Smiles as he darkens a shadow under SOMEONE's breasts. 

TITANIC_2_DVS621
01:27:54,00 --> 01:27:59,50
SOMEONE gazes at SOMEONE as he draws. 

TITANIC_2_DVS623
01:28:05,00 --> 01:28:09,50
With his finger, he rubs various parts of the charcoal drawing SOMEONE's hand, forehead, and face. 

TITANIC_2_DVS625
01:28:10,00 --> 01:28:15,50
SOMEONE stares expressionless. 

TITANIC_2_DVS626
01:28:16,00 --> 01:28:21,50
Gradually, wrinkles form around her eyes 

TITANIC_2_DVS627
01:28:18,00 --> 01:28:23,50
and she transforms into her older self. 

TITANIC_2_DVS628
01:28:30,00 --> 01:28:36,50
The crewmembers and SOMEONE's granddaughter, SOMEONE, stare at her. 

TITANIC_2_DVS629
01:28:42,00 --> 01:28:47,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE exchange smiles. 

TITANIC_2_DVS630
01:28:50,00 --> 01:28:55,50
SOMEONE signs and dates the drawing, then blows on it. 

TITANIC_2_DVS631
01:28:53,00 --> 01:28:58,50
He closes his sketchbook and hands it to SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_2_DVS633
01:29:04,00 --> 01:29:09,50
Later, SOMEONE writes on a sheet of paper. 

TITANIC_2_DVS634
01:29:06,00 --> 01:29:10,50
SOMEONE steps up to her. 

TITANIC_2_DVS635
01:29:12,00 --> 01:29:17,50
She hands him the case holding the Heart of the Ocean. 

TITANIC_2_DVS636
01:29:15,00 --> 01:29:20,50
SOMEONE walks into the next room and slides the case into the safe. 

TITANIC_2_DVS637
01:29:18,00 --> 01:29:24,50
In the first class smoking room, SOMEONE approaches Cal, who stands. 

TITANIC_2_DVS638
01:29:38,00 --> 01:29:45,50
Nighttime. The Titanic moves slowly across dark water. 

TITANIC_2_DVS639
01:29:45,00 --> 01:29:53,50
On the bridge, the helmsman turns the ship's wheel as the ship's officer steps up to Captain SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_2_DVS640
01:30:16,00 --> 01:30:22,50
Captain SOMEONE looks down as he stirs a slice of lemon in his tea. 

TITANIC_2_DVS641
01:30:30,00 --> 01:30:34,50
The captain walks off. 

TITANIC_2_DVS642
01:30:31,00 --> 01:30:38,50
Meanwhile, SOMEONE gazes out on open window along the private promenade. 

TITANIC_2_DVS643
01:30:35,00 --> 01:30:41,50
Stepping back into SOMEONE's suite, he blows on his hands. 

TITANIC_2_DVS644
01:30:38,00 --> 01:30:43,50
Wearing an evening dress, SOMEONE joins him. 

TITANIC_2_DVS645
01:30:45,00 --> 01:30:49,50
SOMEONE grabs SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_2_DVS646
01:30:47,00 --> 01:30:52,50
She pulls him through the sitting room toward a door. 

TITANIC_2_DVS647
01:30:49,00 --> 01:30:54,50
SOMEONE steps into the suite. 

TITANIC_2_DVS648
01:30:51,00 --> 01:30:56,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hurry into SOMEONE's bedroom. 

TITANIC_2_DVS649
01:30:54,00 --> 01:30:58,50
SOMEONE closes the door. 

TITANIC_2_DVS650
01:30:56,00 --> 01:31:01,50
SOMEONE strides through the sitting room. 

TITANIC_2_DVS651
01:30:58,00 --> 01:31:03,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE step through another door into a corridor. 

TITANIC_2_DVS652
01:31:03,00 --> 01:31:08,50
SOMEONE bursts into another room. 

TITANIC_2_DVS653
01:31:05,00 --> 01:31:10,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE hurry down the corridor. 

TITANIC_2_DVS654
01:31:07,00 --> 01:31:13,50
SOMEONE opens a door and glimpses SOMEONE and SOMEONE, who walk faster. 

TITANIC_2_DVS655
01:31:11,00 --> 01:31:15,50
SOMEONE follows them. 

TITANIC_2_DVS656
01:31:15,00 --> 01:31:20,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE run to an elevator. 

TITANIC_2_DVS657
01:31:21,00 --> 01:31:27,50
The dash into the elevator. The operator slides the grate shut. 

TITANIC_2_DVS658
01:31:24,00 --> 01:31:30,50
SOMEONE runs up to the elevator and slams his hands against the grate. 

TITANIC_2_DVS659
01:31:27,00 --> 01:31:33,50
As the elevator descends, SOMEONE glares through glass at them. 

TITANIC_2_DVS660
01:31:30,00 --> 01:31:35,50
SOMEONE raises her middle finger then waves. 

TITANIC_2_DVS661
01:31:33,00 --> 01:31:38,50
SOMEONE hurries to the staircase. 

TITANIC_2_DVS662
01:31:35,00 --> 01:31:42,50
The elevator opens and SOMEONE and SOMEONE spill out, almost running into a SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_2_DVS663
01:31:41,00 --> 01:31:49,50
SOMEONE runs down a staircase as SOMEONE and SOMEONE scramble from the bottom of a different staircase. 

TITANIC_2_DVS664
01:31:46,00 --> 01:31:54,50
SOMEONE bumps into a food cart. He and SOMEONE run through swinging doors into a white corridor, then stop. 

TITANIC_2_DVS665
01:31:52,00 --> 01:31:59,50
SOMEONE runs up to the elevator, then scans the area around himself. 

TITANIC_2_DVS666
01:32:04,00 --> 01:32:09,50
SOMEONE peers in a door's round window. 

TITANIC_2_DVS667
01:32:07,00 --> 01:32:11,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE rush down the corridor. 

TITANIC_2_DVS668
01:32:09,00 --> 01:32:14,50
They turn a corner and stop at a closed door. 

TITANIC_2_DVS669
01:32:12,00 --> 01:32:23,50
SOMEONE opens a different door. They step inside as SOMEONE turns the corner and tries to open the door. Inside, SOMEONE holds her hands to her ears. SOMEONE peers down a ladder at rising smoke. 

TITANIC_2_DVS670
01:32:23,00 --> 01:32:31,50
In the boiler room, men shovel coal into the furnaces. Near them, SOMEONE helps SOMEONE down the ladder. 

TITANIC_2_DVS671
01:32:37,00 --> 01:32:43,50
SOMEONE and SOMEONE run through the smoky boiler room past men shoveling coal. 

TITANIC_2_DVS672
01:32:45,00 --> 01:32:52,50
One man turns to watch them run past. SOMEONE and SOMEONE run through drifting smoke. 

TITANIC_2_DVS673
01:32:53,00 --> 01:33:00,50
A metal door opens. SOMEONE and SOMEONE step through it and into the cargo hold. 

TITANIC_2_DVS674
01:32:58,00 --> 01:33:04,50
They look around themselves as they walk past crates and stacks of boxes. 

TITANIC_2_DVS675
01:33:04,00 --> 01:33:12,50
Leading SOMEONE by the hand, SOMEONE hurries around a stack of crates, then stops at a gleaming black car. 

TITANIC_2_DVS676
01:33:10,00 --> 01:33:15,50
He lets go of SOMEONE's hand, then peers inside the car. 

TITANIC_2_DVS677
01:33:16,00 --> 01:33:22,50
SOMEONE steps around SOMEONE to the passenger door. 

TITANIC_2_DVS678
01:33:21,00 --> 01:33:25,50
He holds out his hand and opens the door. 

TITANIC_2_DVS679
01:33:23,00 --> 01:33:29,50
SOMEONE takes his hand and steps up into the passenger compartment. 

TITANIC_2_DVS680
01:33:27,00 --> 01:33:30,50
SOMEONE shuts his door. 

TITANIC_2_DVS681
01:33:28,00 --> 01:33:32,50
As SOMEONE glances around herself, SOMEONE steps into the open-sided driver seat. 

TITANIC_2_DVS683
01:33:32,00 --> 01:33:37,50
SOMEONE pulls down a glass partition. 

TITANIC_2_DVS684
01:33:40,00 --> 01:33:46,50
SOMEONE reaches over SOMEONE's shoulders, then pulls him into the passenger compartment. 

TITANIC_2_DVS685
01:33:47,00 --> 01:33:52,50
Sitting on the seat, SOMEONE puts his arm around SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_2_DVS686
01:33:50,00 --> 01:33:56,50
They gaze into each other's eyes as they interlock their fingers. 

TITANIC_2_DVS687
01:34:04,00 --> 01:34:10,50
SOMEONE lays her head on SOMEONE's shoulder, then kisses his fingertips. 

TITANIC_2_DVS688
01:34:23,00 --> 01:34:28,50
She places SOMEONE's hand on her breast. 

TITANIC_2_DVS690
01:34:37,00 --> 01:34:43,50
The Titanic leaves a long wake in the dark ocean. 

TITANIC_2_DVS691
01:34:43,00 --> 01:34:50,50
Two sailors stand in a metal crow's nest attached to a mast high above the deck. 

TITANIC_2_DVS692
01:35:05,00 --> 01:35:12,50
Murdoch, with his collar up, peers over the railing outside the wheelhouse. 

TITANIC_2_DVS693
01:35:10,00 --> 01:35:18,50
In the back seat of the car, SOMEONE slaps her hand against the back window, 

TITANIC_2_DVS694
01:35:19,00 --> 01:35:23,50
her hand against the back window,then slowly slides it downward. 

TITANIC_2_DVS696
01:35:23,00 --> 01:35:28,50
Naked and his face dripping with sweat, SOMEONE lies on top of SOMEONE. He breathes heavily as they gaze at each other. 

TITANIC_2_DVS698
01:35:54,00 --> 01:36:00,50
SOMEONE strokes SOMEONE's hair, then kisses his forehead. He lays his head on her chest. 

TITANIC_2_DVS700
01:36:07,00 --> 01:36:14,50
In the boiler room, two stewards with flashlights step down a short corridor and into the cargo hold. 

TITANIC_2_DVS701
01:36:14,00 --> 01:36:20,50
SOMEONE opens the safe. He pulls out a note and SOMEONE's portfolio. 

TITANIC_2_DVS702
01:36:18,00 --> 01:36:25,50
SOMEONE approaches. SOMEONE opens the portfolio and studies the drawing of SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_2_DVS703
01:36:23,00 --> 01:36:27,50
He reads the note. 

TITANIC_2_DVS704
01:36:24,00 --> 01:36:30,50
Darling, now you can keep us both locked in your safe. SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_2_DVS705
01:36:28,00 --> 01:36:34,50
SOMEONE's forehead tenses as he closes then opens his eyes. 

TITANIC_2_DVS706
01:36:31,00 --> 01:36:35,50
He glances at the note again. 

TITANIC_2_DVS707
01:36:45,00 --> 01:36:50,50
In the hold, the two stewards creep toward the car. 

TITANIC_2_DVS708
01:36:48,00 --> 01:36:54,50
One SOMEONE shines his flashlight in the car's steamed up windows. 

TITANIC_2_DVS709
01:36:51,00 --> 01:36:58,50
He snaps his fingers and points to the car,  

TITANIC_2_DVS710
01:36:55,00 --> 01:37:00,50
then yanks open the car door, revealing empty seats. 

TITANIC_2_DVS711
01:36:59,00 --> 01:37:05,50
Smiling, SOMEONE and SOMEONE run onto the forward well deck. 

TITANIC_2_DVS712
01:37:13,00 --> 01:37:18,50
SOMEONE places her hand on SOMEONE's lips and gazes at him. 

TITANIC_2_DVS714
01:37:34,00 --> 01:37:41,50
Standing at the bridge rail, SOMEONE glances down at them, smiles, and walks off. 

TITANIC_2_DVS715
01:37:38,00 --> 01:37:45,50
Watching from the crow's nest, another man, Fleet, looks down and taps his comrade Lee on the arm. 

TITANIC_2_DVS716
01:37:45,00 --> 01:37:49,50
They stare down at SOMEONE and SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_2_DVS717
01:37:55,00 --> 01:38:02,50
The men turn and gaze past the ship. Their eyes widen as a large iceberg looms straight ahead. 

TITANIC_2_DVS718
01:38:03,00 --> 01:38:10,50
Fleet rings the lookout bell three times, then grabs a telephone which rings on the bridge. 

TITANIC_2_DVS719
01:38:09,00 --> 01:38:14,50
The quartermaster at the wheel glances back at the phone. 

TITANIC_2_DVS720
01:38:15,00 --> 01:38:21,50
Officer Moody steps onto the bridge and answers the phone. 

TITANIC_2_DVS721
01:38:24,00 --> 01:38:30,50
Moody hangs up and turns to SOMEONE as he runs to the bridge door. 

TITANIC_2_DVS722
01:38:29,00 --> 01:38:38,50
Quartermaster SOMEONE turns the wheel to the left. SOMEONE rushes over to the engine room telegraph and shifts the handle to full speed astern. 

TITANIC_2_DVS723
01:38:39,00 --> 01:38:47,50
SOMEONE turns the wheel quickly. In the engine room, the chief engineer spots the telegraph shift and drops a pot of steaming soup. 

TITANIC_2_DVS724
01:38:45,00 --> 01:38:50,50
SOMEONE turns the wheel until it stops. 

TITANIC_2_DVS725
01:38:50,00 --> 01:38:57,50
SOMEONE hurries to the bridge rail and peers at the iceberg. In the engine room, an engineer yells. 

TITANIC_2_DVS726
01:38:56,00 --> 01:39:00,50
Other engineers scurry around. 

TITANIC_2_DVS727
01:39:01,00 --> 01:39:05,50
A red warning light flashes. 

TITANIC_2_DVS728
01:39:05,00 --> 01:39:12,50
Engineers slam the furnace dampers shut. The needle on the steam pressure gauge drops. 

TITANIC_2_DVS729
01:39:11,00 --> 01:39:16,50
Underwater, the ship's main propeller slows. 

TITANIC_2_DVS730
01:39:14,00 --> 01:39:18,50
The main propeller stops. 

TITANIC_2_DVS731
01:39:17,00 --> 01:39:23,50
An engineer pulls down a thick lever. All the propellers stop. 

TITANIC_2_DVS732
01:39:29,00 --> 01:39:35,50
An officer pushes an engineer out of the way and turns a wheel quickly to the right. 

TITANIC_2_DVS733
01:39:32,00 --> 01:39:37,50
The propellers spin in the opposite direction. 

TITANIC_2_DVS734
01:39:42,00 --> 01:39:49,50
In the crow's nest, the men stare at the iceberg as the ships heads straight toward it. 

TITANIC_2_DVS735
01:39:51,00 --> 01:39:55,50
SOMEONE stares at the iceberg. 

TITANIC_2_DVS736
01:40:00,00 --> 01:40:05,50
Nearing the iceberg, the ship veers slowly to the left. 

TITANIC_2_DVS737
01:40:05,00 --> 01:40:10,50
The ship's propellers turn in reverse. 

TITANIC_2_DVS738
01:40:10,00 --> 01:40:15,50
Sweat trickles down SOMEONE's temples. 

TITANIC_2_DVS739
01:40:13,00 --> 01:40:21,50
The ship's bow shifts to the left of the iceberg. At the bow railing, a man runs toward the bridge. 

TITANIC_2_DVS740
01:40:18,00 --> 01:40:33,50
The ship's hull scrapes along the side of the iceberg. On the forward well deck, SOMEONE and SOMEONE stop kissing as the ship trembles. On the bridge deck, SOMEONE glances down at his hands resting on the shaking rail. Above, Fleet holds on to the rim of the crow's nest while Lee sits on the floor. 

TITANIC_2_DVS741
01:40:33,00 --> 01:40:40,50
In the bridge, SOMEONE keeps the wheel turned hard left. Below deck, SOMEONE sits up in his bunk. 

TITANIC_2_DVS742
01:40:38,00 --> 01:40:47,50
In the cargo hold, water shoots through a long tear in the hull as it rips open. In his cabin, SOMEONE sits at his desk. 

TITANIC_2_DVS743
01:40:44,00 --> 01:40:50,50
He glances up at the trembling crystal chandelier above. 

TITANIC_2_DVS744
01:40:47,00 --> 01:40:55,50
In the crow's nest, Fleet and Lee gaze at the iceberg. On the bridge deck, SOMEONE yells to SOMEONE. 

TITANIC_2_DVS745
01:40:55,00 --> 01:41:13,50
SOMEONE turns the wheel to the right. Meanwhile, water floods the cargo hold, knocking down the two stewards. On the front well deck, SOMEONE pushes SOMEONE behind him as the ship breaks up chunks of ice which land on the deck and knock down two men. The ship continues moving alongside the iceberg. 

TITANIC_2_DVS746
01:41:12,00 --> 01:41:19,50
In the engine room, water pours in as a man scrambles past furnace stokers swept across the floor. 

TITANIC_2_DVS747
01:41:26,00 --> 01:41:38,50
SOMEONE runs to the starboard railing and watches as the back of the ship moves alongside the iceberg. SOMEONE runs to the bridge and moves a lever which closes the hydraulic watertight doors in the engine room. 

TITANIC_2_DVS748
01:41:35,00 --> 01:41:40,50
A man motions to the stokers. 

TITANIC_2_DVS749
01:41:42,00 --> 01:41:48,50
Workers run through the rising water and crawl under the lowering doors. 

TITANIC_2_DVS750
01:41:55,00 --> 01:42:09,50
He follows the others through one of the doorways. The door closes, leaving several stokers behind. As the others escape past closing doors, the remaining stoker dives under the last closing door and crawls out as its steel hatch slams shut. 

TITANIC_2_DVS751
01:42:10,00 --> 01:42:18,50
